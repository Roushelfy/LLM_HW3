        "text": "Almost a quarter of the UK’s sea swimmers may not take a dip in the ocean this year because of sewage dumping by water companies, according to a poll.Sewage was dumped into waters near England’s most celebrated beaches for nearly 8,500 hours last year, analysis shows. A separate review earlier this year found there were 1,504 discharges in 2022 on beaches supposed to be free from such pollution.Water companies have been under increasing pressure to clean up their act amid growing outrage over payouts of more than £2bn a year on average since 1991.The poll, carried out by Savanta for the Liberal Democrats, spoke to 2,272 UK adults between 21 and 23 July. Just over 30% said they typically went sea swimming during the summer, and of these 23% said they would not this year because of sewage dumping by water companies.More than two in five of the regular beachgoers also said they were less likely to visit the British seaside this summer because of sewage discharges.The government has said it will allow the Environment Agency to impose unlimited fines on rule-breaking water companies. Penalties are currently capped at £250,000.The Lib Dems have been calling for a sewage tax on annual profits and a ban on water company executive bonuses.“Coastal communities are at the mercy of water companies who unapologetically discharge raw sewage into popular swimming spots,” Tim Farron, the Lib Dems’ environment spokesperson said. “This Conservative government needs to stop letting water companies off the hook and finally ban these disgusting sewage discharges and defend our tourism sector.”Cathryn Ross, Thames Water’s interim chief executive, recently described many of her company’s pipes as “ageing assets” that should have been replaced. Thames Water does not discharge into coastal waters as the area the company covers is inland.Water companies are supposed to release raw sewage only after heavy rains, to stop sewage backing up the system and risking flooding, with the most recent data showing they had collectively dumped sewage 372,533 times in 2021 and 301,091 times in 2022.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: “Banning discharges overnight without any plan to fix storm overflows is reckless and would see sewage backing up into people’s homes and the street.“The secretary of state demanded action plans on every storm overflow in the country and our storm overflow discharge reduction plan requires water companies to spend £56bn to eliminate the harm from storm overflows – the largest infrastructure investment in water company history.”A Water UK spokesperson said standards at beaches had improved exponentially since the 1990s but that the industry recognised it had been slow “to tackle the harm to our seas caused by sewage overflows”.“Over the next seven years, water and sewerage companies plan to spend £10bn – a tripling on current levels of investment – in the biggest transformation of our sewers since the Victorian era,” they said. “As part of this, bathing waters will be prioritised and among the first to receive funding.”"

        "text": "Australians should prepare for a summer of heatwaves even if an El Niño does not take hold this year, a senior climate scientist at the Bureau of Meteorology has said.Dr Karl Braganza, the bureau’s national manager for climate services, said this year “could be significant in terms of heatwaves and fires”, but was unlikely to repeat the horrors of the 2019-20 black summer bushfires.He said the current record breaking heat in the world’s oceans could be one reason behind the failure of El Niño to form so far.“Historically we have not seen a situation like this before going into an El Niño event with record global ocean temperatures,” he said.Weatherwatch: Why El Niño is so hard to predictRead moreEl Niño is characterised by high ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific that weaken the east to west trade winds that blow over the ocean. This climate pattern can drive droughts and heat in Australia, and can push up global temperatures.While the World Meteorological Organization and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have already said an El Niño is in place, the bureau said this week the atmosphere was still not giving a consistent signal – mainly the changes in the trade winds – that were typical of an El Nińo.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nAccording to the bureau’s latest long range outlook, released on Thursday, most of the country is likely to see warmer than average temperatures out to October, and lower than average rainfall.Braganza said that forecast stood, regardless of whether an El Niño did develop. He said if El Niño was declared, it would give the bureau more confidence that beyond October the outlook would remain mostly warm and dry throughout the rest of the summer.According to the BoM, warmer than average temperatures and lower than average rainfall is likely until October. Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/EPALooking at El Niños of the past, Braganza said typically you would see a tongue of warm ocean water extending from the west coast of central America across the equatorial Pacific.This would usually have a horseshoe-shaped area of cooler water surrounding it off Australia’s northeast that sets up a reversal of the trade winds, locking the El Niño in place.“This does not look like that canonical El Niño,” said Braganza. “The western Pacific and the Indian Ocean are quite warm and the tropical Atlantic is extremely warm at the moment.”Differences in temperature across different parts of the ocean can drive large scale weather patterns like El Niño, but right now it was warm across most of the ocean.Braganza said it was a “point of conjecture” that these widespread record ocean temperatures “could be making it harder for the El Niño to get going in the atmosphere”.“The bottom line is that we are adding heat to the ocean and that has to be modulating the ocean’s natural variability to some degree, but we don’t have a clear scientific understanding of that at the moment.”NSW warned of bushfire dangers as dry El Niño looms after ‘prolific’ vegetation growthRead moreBraganza said as the world’s climate had been changed, the ability to forecast based on past events had been compromised.The bureau still considers there to be a 70% chance of an El Niño developing later this year.Braganza said forecasts were also showing that another phenomenon in the Indian Ocean that can reduce rainfall was likely to develop over spring. If that happens and an El Niño also locks into place “we will likely strengthen our forecast advice”, Braganza said.Some climate scientists and bushfire experts have expressed concern that after three consecutive years of very wet La Niña summers, there is now a lot of grass and vegetation that could become fuel for fires.“The fuel growth is remarkable and in our new climate system, how quickly can we dry out that fuel?” Braganza said.Climate scientists are concerned that after three years of La Niña, the amount of vegetation for fire fuel is large. Photograph: Sean Blocksidge/DFES“You would say it won’t be like a 2019 event, but our message is to prepare for a summer where it could be significant in terms of heatwaves and fires. But I’m less worried than I would be if we had had two years of drought.”And Braganza said meteorologists were also watching closely for any climate impacts from a significant loss of Antarctic sea ice this year compared with previous years.Less sea ice had the potential to contribute to changes in wind and weather patterns, he said.“What we are seeing now due to the lack of growth is that instead of sea ice extending into the mid-latitudes, you now have dark ocean. That changes the solar radiation balance in the southern hemisphere.”"

Instead, an organism called halobacteria might be the culprit.Halobacteria are single-celled organisms that thrive in bodies of water with salt levels that are so high that the bacteria are considered “extremophiles”, or organisms that thrive in conditions too extreme for most living things. The salinity inside the Kealia Pond outlet area is currently greater than 70 parts per thousand, which is twice the salinity of seawater. Wolfe said the lab will need to conduct a DNA analysis to definitively identify the organism.The pink lakes of Australia – in picturesRead moreMaui’s drought is likely contributing to the situation. Normally Waikapu Stream feeds into Kealia Pond and raises water levels there, but Wolfe said that hasn’t happened in a long time.When it rains, the stream will flow into Kealia’s main pond and then into the outlet area that’s now pink. This is likely to reduce the salinity and change the water’s colour.“That might be what makes it go away,” Wolfe said.This 8 November 2023 photo provided by Leslie Diamond shows the pond at the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge on Maui, Hawaii, that turned pink on 30 October 2023.

But there is no saint, and the well was in fact made in 1820 by Sir Thomas Dyke Acland, a local MP and baronet, and an admirer of the picturesque, who named it after his youngest daughter. It is one of a pair that Acland created – the even more modest Katherine’s Well is about a quarter of a mile to the east.

There was an “increased likelihood of compounding effects of extreme rainfall following significant fire seasons due to climate change”, the report concluded.“Climate change is predicted to drive more frequent and extreme natural disasters in coming years.“This will threaten the resilience or capacity of the catchment to maintain essential ecosystem services such as the provision of adequate, good quality source water.”The audit recommended the NSW government review its climate change mitigation policies and said more data collection was needed, as modelling indicates extreme weather will become more frequent.“Adverse impacts from climate-driven events are already observable in the catchment, although the thresholds to avoid serious and irreversible harm to catchment health from a changing climate are unclear,” the report read.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said there were “several safety barriers that means Sydney’s drinking water source is among the best protected in the world”.The catchment will be reviewed again in 2025."

We were happy to share the whole day on Bleaklow – a name that speaks volumes by itself – with five others. And two of them were at some other, undetermined gritstone edge, on a far horizon.Our hearts, however, were for the Barrow Stones, the monolith group below Bleaklow Hill and surely the most beautiful in an area not short of such monuments. They’re about an hour’s slow grind across the moors that were traditionally shooting terrain. Despite the map indicating shooters’ butts and a cabin, we heard the distant sounds of a single red grouse during the entire visit, suggesting that both the bird and its followers could fade away in a near future.‘The stone can possess multiple identities depending on angle … My haul this time included a sperm whale and an extinct South American mammal called a toxodon.’ Photograph: Mark CockerThe area’s other famous inhabitant is labrador tea, a northern rhododendron shrub with white flowers that occurs nowhere else in Derbyshire.

Worn smooth by millennia of exposure at almost 2,000 feet, these rocks have acquired a fantastical array of organic shapes. Every visit produces new discoveries. In fact, the very same stone can possess multiple identities depending on angle, or your own inner whim.My haul this time included a sperm whale, an enormous toad, a conclave of Tolkien’s ents and an extinct South American mammal – half warthog, half rhinoceros – called a toxodon.

This trip’s find was a rock reminding me of the three-metre-tall flightless creature with meat-cleaving beak in the family Phorusrhacidae, whose common name is “terror bird”.

        "text": "Michael Gove’s plans to lift the onshore wind ban are finally here, after what campaigners have termed a “Tory obsession” with blocking the form of renewable energy.Since 2015, it has been almost impossible to erect wind turbines in England because the planning system was changed so even one objection from a local resident could derail an entire project – an incredibly stringent interpretation of community consent. Just 20 turbines have been approved since 2014 as a result.It has taken years of campaigning – and squabbling – within the government and the backbenches to get to this point, which could make it slightly easier to build renewables.Though what the housing secretary has proposed is better than the previous situation, it still leaves onshore wind at a disadvantage compared with any other infrastructure project and campaigners say developers will still not invest in building windfarms if their proposals could be squashed by local councillors.It will also confine onshore wind to certain areas of the country, which Gove defined in his statement on Tuesday as “suitable locations”. He is loosening the requirement for a location to be deemed suitable, but other infrastructure projects are not confined to certain places in this way.Luke Clark from the trade body RenewableUK said: “Previously, the government said that suitable areas had to be identified in a local development plan. Today they have announced new ways of identifying suitable areas, as it can take some time for local development plans to be published. But other forms of energy and electricity generation do not have that requirement to only be in ‘suitable areas’. As a result, we don’t think that it’s going to make a change to increase investment at a level we need to cut bills and increase energy security.”The updated National Planning Policy Framework statement says: “Except for applications for the repowering and life extension of existing wind turbines, a planning application for wind energy development involving one or more turbines should not be considered acceptable unless it is in an area identified as suitable for wind energy development in the development plan or a supplementary planning document; and, after consultation, it can be demonstrated that the planning impacts identified by the affected local community have been appropriately addressed and the proposal has community support.” Experts say these area-based restrictions are unique to onshore wind.The shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, and the Labour party have been calling for onshore wind to be brought in line with other infrastructure projects, which do not face the same barriers.Gove’s plans to give discounts on energy bills to those who live near the developments are interesting, but the truth is that all of our bills will be reduced if cheaper forms of energy are given the green light, and we rely less on expensive and planet-destroying fossil fuels.This loosening of planning rules only came about because of strong campaigning from a large group of Tory MPs, including the widely respected former Cop26 president, Alok Sharma.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Sam Hall, the director of the forum Conservative Environment Network, said: “Although not a full normalisation as some have called for, these revised tests open the door to new onshore wind investment in England, which will reduce consumer bills, emissions and gas imports.”Critics will point out that, although the government says it is prioritising growth, the fact is that it has taken years of campaigning to achieve a tweak to a document that will still discourage cheap, clean energy from being built."

Installed in cities hit hard by recent heatwaves, the ads feature a map of temperature records broken across the country this summer, and read: “Brought to you by Big Oil.”The campaign comes as millions of people across the country continue to face heat advisories, and as climate scientists warn that July was Earth’s hottest since record-keeping began in 1880. The searing heatwaves seen across the US and Europe this summer would have been “virtually impossible” were it not for the climate crisis, driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels, a July analysis found.“I think the most important thing that we can do right now is to try and connect the dots between the extreme weather that people are seeing and the fossil fuel industry that’s driving it,” said Jamie Henn of Fossil Free Media.Heat is the deadliest form of extreme weather in the US, and this summer record-breaking temperatures could fuel unprecedented numbers of heat-related deaths nationwide, experts caution.People seeking shelter from the heat rest at the First Congregational United Church of Christ cooling center on 14 July 2023 in Phoenix, Arizona. Photograph: Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesThe Biden administration has talked about the dangers of heatwaves and worked to help communities weather them. On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) also announced they will hold a virtual summit on extreme heat preparedness this coming Monday, convening local community leaders who will share hard-learned resilience strategies. Biden has also worked to boost renewable energy sources with policies like the Inflation Reduction Act. Yet all the while, the president has approved new highly polluting fossil fuel projects, said Henn.“The feeling is that after this summer, where we were really seeing the climate crisis spin out of control, maybe we can pull together the type of political energy necessary to really pressure for what scientists say is necessary, which is to stop new fossil fuel projects,” he said.On Sunday 17 September, thousands of climate activists will take up that message during the “March to End Fossil Fuels” in New York City. Information about the march is available on a website advertised on the billboards, ThankYouBigOil.com.The protest, convened by a coalition of groups including Fossil Free Media, will focus on pushing the Biden administration to take bold steps to phase out fossil fuels and will come days before the United Nations Climate Ambition Summit, which the UN secretary general, António Guterres, has described as a “no nonsense” conference.A billboard calling out big oil for its contribution to the climate crisis in Fresno, California. Photograph: Fossil Fuel Media“The invitation [to the summit] is open. But the price of entry is non-negotiable – serious new climate action that will move the needle forward,” he announced in December. “No exceptions. There will be no room for backsliders, greenwashers, blame-shifters or repackaging of announcements of previous years.”Henn said that means participation should require “a plan to stop new coal oil and gas development and phase out fossil fuel development overall”.“That’s what it means to have a climate plan,” he said. “As far as we can tell, the White House has no such plan.”Activists are trying to change that, he said, by demanding an end to the approval of new oil and gas projects, a phasing out of fossil fuel drilling on public lands, the declaration of a federal climate emergency and support for workers as polluting industries are phased out. “If the president wants to be a climate leader on a global stage,” said Henn, “this is an area that he really needs to prioritize.”"

However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency.”Global average surface temperatures have never before breached the 1.5C threshold. The highest average in previous years was 1.28C above pre-industrial levels.Global mean near-surface temperature anomalies from 1850-1900 average, °CThe report, published on Wednesday, found there was a 66% likelihood of exceeding the 1.5C threshold in at least one year between 2023 and 2027.New record temperatures have been set in many areas around the world in the heatwaves of the past year, but those highs may only be the beginning, according to the report, as climate breakdown and the impact of a developing El Niño weather system combine to create heatwaves across the globe.El Niño is part of an oscillating weather system that develops in the Pacific. For the past three years, the world has been in the opposing phase, known as La Niña, which has had a dampening effect on temperature increases around the world.As La Niña ends and a new El Niño develops, there is a 98% likelihood that at least one of the next five years will be the hottest on record, the scientists found.Near-surface temperature anomalies, 12-month average in comparison with 1991-2020Taalas warned of the effects. “A warming El Niño is expected to develop in the coming months and this will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory. This will have far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management and the environment,” he said. “We need to be prepared.”The Arctic is heating much faster than the rest of the world, and this appears to be having an impact on global weather systems, including the jet stream, which has disrupted weather across the northern hemisphere in recent years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This is particularly bad news for the Amazon, where scientists have grown increasingly concerned that a vicious cycle of heating and deforestation could tip the region from rainforest into savannah-like conditions.UN warns heat records could be broken as chance of El Niño risesRead moreThat could have calamitous consequences for the planet, which relies on rainforests as massive carbon sinks.Over the next five years, there is likely to be above-average rainfall in northern Europe, Alaska and northern Siberia, and the Sahel, according to the report.For each year from 2023 to 2027, the global near-surface temperature is predicted to be between 1.1C and 1.8C above the pre-industrial average, taken from the years 1850 to 1900.The world has warmed considerably in recent years. In 2015, when the Paris agreement was signed, requiring countries to hold global temperature increases to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels while “pursuing efforts” to hold them to 1.5C, it was forecast that the chance of temporarily exceeding the 1.5C threshold within the following five years was zero.This November, governments will meet for the Cop28 UN climate summit, where they will assess progress towards meeting the goals of the Paris agreement. Known as the “global stocktake”, this assessment is likely to show that the world is far off track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the 43% this decade that is required to have a good chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C."

        "text": "The world is only a few tenths of a degree away from the globally accepted goal of limiting warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. On current trends, we will shoot past the target within a decade. That’s the warning from the world’s leading scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In their last report while it is still feasible to stay within 1.5C, they warn that what governments do in the next few years to limit greenhouse gas emissions will determine whether temperatures keep rising dangerously or fall back to safe levels.Billions of poor people who bear the least responsibility for the climate emergency are already being hit hard. Extreme weather events such as the flash floods in Turkey or Cyclone Freddy over southern Africa, which took hundreds of lives, are becoming more common occurrences. It is unequivocal, say the scientists, that human activity has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. It is also human activity that can bring temperatures down. Cutting carbon pollution and fossil fuel use by nearly two-thirds by 2035 would give humanity a decent shot at the target. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, spelled out what this means: an end to new fossil fuel exploration and rich countries exiting coal, oil and gas by 2040. The UK, which is opening coalmines and approving North Sea oil and gas licences, should take note.Global emissions of carbon dioxide hit a record high last year despite green tech growth. It’s the required decline in CO2 that gives climate scientists nightmares. The 2015 Paris agreement suggested the answer lay in negative emissions – where new technology would reduce the amount of carbon already in the atmosphere and buy society time. There are two ways to remove carbon dioxide. One is with land-management methods such as reforestation. The other is capturing and storing carbon underground or in the oceans. The IPCC thinks there is enough potential CO2 storage to limit global warming to 1.5C from now to 2100. However, such novel methods currently account for just 0.1% of all negative emission use. That might explain why many climate scientists have dismissed the idea as “magical thinking”.The rich world has the money and the technological prowess to stop the planet from burning up. Yet climate financing has fallen far short of tackling the climate emergency. The IPCC estimates that investment in climate mitigation and adaptation is three to six times lower than where it needs to be to reach the goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C. One reason is that the world is relying on finance houses to stump up the cash. We cannot leave it to the private sector to solve global heating. Trillions of dollars of multi-year investments are needed to save humanity but companies won’t risk spending when the payback may take years, or never arise. That is why the state needs to be involved in a much bigger way – but without socialising risks and allowing banks to privatise the profit.Some suggest the world should face up to the fact the 1.5C target will be missed. But changing it to a higher number would allow climate sceptics to argue that “wolf” had been cried. Peter Thorne, a researcher at Maynooth University in Ireland, and one of the IPCC report’s authors, warned that governments, communities and individuals “have made climate change somebody else’s problem”. Yet the deleterious effects are affecting everyone. Technology that works can solve a problem if it gets deployed. This depends on getting the right policies in place and crucially securing the funding to make it happen. None of this will materialise if politicians – and the public – see the climate emergency as somebody else’s problem."

        "text": "The government has been accused of breaking its promise to English farmers, with hundreds of millions of pounds missing from the farming budget.Ministers had promised that by the end of this parliament, they would spend £2.4bn a year on agriculture. This money was to replace the EU’s common agricultural policy, which paid farmers for each hectare of land they managed. Instead, the government promised that farmers could improve the natural environment and be paid handsomely for delivering public goods, thus helping nature and keeping farms in business.However, the government has still not spent the promised £2.4bn a year. Figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) show an underspend of £110m in 2021/22 and £117m in 2022/23, meaning £227m of promised funds have not been spent.Agricultural businesses have been asked to sign up to environmental schemes in which they are paid for taking actions such as improving the soil and digging ponds, which are to replace the basic payments they received under direct subsidy. These direct payments are being phased out each year.The money is also spent on measures to “improve farm prosperity”, so instead of receiving the money directly farmers can participate in schemes to learn how to improve their business.Farmers said they had no idea where much of the promised £2.4bn farming budget is, as their direct payments have been halved since Brexit. Amid rising costs and inflation, this is another squeeze on finances for farming businesses, many of which fear they will have to shut down.The environment schemes, which are guaranteed payments to farmers as opposed to the ad hoc grants or training programmes also included in the budget, have yielded a relatively small spend for farms. The total spend by the government on environment farming schemes was £515m in 2021/22 and £688m in 2022/23.Steve Reed, the shadow environment secretary, said Labour would free up the missing funding for farmers and make it easier to receive money from environment schemes. Reed said: “The Conservatives have broken yet another promise to our farmers. This money should be in the pockets of our farmers, who have instead been abandoned by this government.“Labour will cut through the Tory bureaucracy that has blocked farmers from receiving funding for work that includes protecting nature and wildlife habitats on their land. But we will go further. Labour will tear down export barriers for farmers by seeking a veterinary agreement with the EU, ensure more food bought by the public sector is locally produced, and generate clean energy here in the UK to cut farmers’ energy bills. Labour is determined to give farmers their future back.”The environment secretary, Steve Barclay, is to address farmers on Thursday at the Oxford Farming Conference, to make the government’s pre-general election pitch to the agriculture industry. He is not expected to lay out a detailed plan to spend the money missing from the budget.Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers’ Union, said the underspend was unacceptable.She added: “Farmers were promised a seamless transition to [the post-Brexit payment scheme] Elms. In a general election year it is unacceptable that the schemes are still in development, there are huge concerns at to whether the sustainable farming incentive payments can be delivered – despite the NFU and others asking for piloting of delivery, this hasn’t happened. With 50% of basic payment scheme payments cut, farmers in England have no idea where that money is and what it has been spent on.”A Defra spokesperson said: “These claims are categorically untrue. As we have repeatedly made clear, we are on track to meet our commitment to maintaining our annual farming budget for England at £2.4bn per year, with a higher spend planned in the final year of this parliament to ensure we achieve this. We have invested a significant amount of money in the farming sector including through Elms and we are seeing strong demand for the improved sustainable farming incentive offer. This has been complemented by grants and funds to help farmers innovate and modernise, such as the Farming innovation programme.”"

Now a non-profit conservation group wants to see them brought back, and say the otters could help restore the region’s crucial but decimated kelp forests.The Center for Biological Diversity has petitioned the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to reintroduce the furry mammals to a large swath of the west coast stretching from northern California to Oregon, pointing to the vital role otters play in the coastal ecosystem. A small population of southern sea otters lives on California’s central coast, where the Monterey Bay Aquarium regularly documents their adventures, but the threatened animal occupies just 13% of its historic range.“There’s this big gap between the San Francisco Bay Area through Oregon where there are no sea otters,” said Emily Jeffers, an attorney in the oceans program at the Center for Biological Diversity. “They are really important to coastal ecosystems but they are just missing from a huge chunk of our coastline.”Sea otters are seen together along the Elkhorn slough in Moss Landing, California. Photograph: Eric Risberg/APThe animals help keep sea urchin populations in check, which is vital to protect kelp forests – in northern California, 95% of kelp forests have disappeared due to urchin barrens. Reintroduction of otters is necessary to bring the animals back to their historic US range, recover the threatened southern sea otter and restore important coastal ecosystems including kelp forests and seagrass beds, the Center for Biological Diversity wrote in its letter to the federal government.The center also asked the USFWS to assess the feasibility of reintroducing the otter from southern California into Baja California, Mexico.“Bringing the sea otter back to the broader west coast would be an unparalleled conservation success story,” Kristin Carden, a former senior scientist at the center, said in a statement. “Not only would the sea otters thrive, but they would also help restore vital kelp forest and seagrass ecosystems.”Last year the USFWS announced the results of a sea otter feasibility assessment in which the agency found that reintroducing the animal along the Pacific coast is biologically and socioeconomically feasible, and would “result in significant conservation benefits to the species … and to the nearshore marine ecosystem”.The Monterey Bay Aquarium, which has worked with the USFWS to help the recovery of the sea otter population, has publicly supported reintroduction efforts, describing it in a statement as “a promising strategy for returning the species to other parts of its historical range along the California coast”.Kelp forests lit by southern California’s summer sunlight. Photograph: Douglas Klug/Getty ImagesThe sea otter, which is the smallest marine mammal in North America at up to 4ft long and 70lbs, use a thick layer of fur to stay warm in the cold Pacific waters. In the 18th and 19th centuries, fur traders nearly drove the species to extinction for their warm pelts, killing 99% of the global population, Jeffers said.Today the populations face risks from oil spills, low genetic diversity and disease. Reintroduction is not unprecedented – such efforts have helped re-establish populations along other parts of the coast.“Sea otters are important to healthy oceans, healthy coastlines. If we want to see our coastlines thrive, sea otters need to be a part of them,” Jeffers said."

Orosco is using a new technique to extract gold in Madre de Dios, Peru’s goldmining centre, in an attempt to clean up the industry.The shaking table separates the precious metal without the need for mercury, traditionally used to separate gold, which should reduce the health and environmental risks associated with mining.“At first, it was a radical change because it affected how we organised our work,” says Orosco, an artisanal miner at the Fátima mining concession. There was suspicion among some miners and traders about the quality of the gold the shaking tables produced, “but we decided to keep working and follow training to improve and demonstrate that it’s possible”.Using a shaking table to separate gold from dirt and sand without using mercury. Photograph: Pure EarthOrosco and 45 colleagues in four mining concessions are now about to become the first miners in the Amazon to obtain the Fairmined Ecological Gold certification, an internationally recognised standard that confirms gold is mined in a responsible way and guarantees workers a premium rate for their product on the international market.“For over 10 years, one of our dreams was to be able to produce ‘ecological gold’ and obtain this certification. And now we are nearly here,” says Vilma Contreras, the president of AMATAF (the Tauro Fátima Mining Association). “We want to live a safe life and we want to transform goldmining in the Amazon into a respected, lawful activity.”Faustino Orosco with a piece of gold he extracted without mercury. Photograph: Pure EarthMaking substantial changes to mining in the region will require a huge effort, though. Most goldmines in Madre de Dios, in the south-east of Peru, are illegal, many operated by criminal gangs who have been accused of land grabs and killing anyone who tries to stop them. An estimated 95,750 hectares (236,600 acres) of rainforest was lost to illegal mining between 1985 and 2017.“We see all kinds of problems,” says Jefferson Gonzales Enoki, the regional governor of Madre de Dios. “There is people trafficking, drug trafficking, prostitution and criminal gangs. The crime rates and the perception of insecurity among citizens are enormous.”In 2019, the Peruvian government launched Operation Mercury to stop illegal mining in the settlement of La Pampa, which reduced deforestation by more than 92%.“What is happening in Madre de Dios now is the new mining activity that we want,” says Enoki. “We want efficient and responsible mining activities with no mercury, reforestation and better labour rights. Formalisation ensures that miners carry out their activities with permissions and that they contribute to tax collection too.”Reforestation workshops under way in Madre de Dios.

At the time, it said tunnelling was continuing and that the integrity of the tunnel “has not been compromised”.Fossil fuel companies won’t save us from climate change. We need governments to step up | Adam MortonRead moreHowever, a Snowy Hydro spokesperson told Guardian Australia the tunnel boring machine (TBM), dubbed Florence, was now “temporarily paused” while plans to remediate the collapsed area are finalised.Map of Tantangara“Across the project, and as anticipated, the ground conditions encountered by the Snowy 2.0 TBMs are highly variable, ranging from soft, sandy ground to extremely hard rock,” the spokesperson said, in explaining why the drilling had stopped.She declined to detail how much of the 17km tunnel had so far been dug, and how long Florence would likely be stalled.Snowy Hydro waited until late last year to inform the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) that the project would be delayed a year until 30 December 2027. The company still states on its website that the first power is expect to be supplied in 2025.The project aims to link two existing Snowy reservoirs by tunnels up to 27km in length.A spokesperson for the climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said Snowy Hydro had advised the government about the tunnel issues but said it was the latest hitch inherited from the previous Turnbull-Morrison government.“We will continue to work with the new CEO [Dennis Barnes] and the Snowy team to ensure Snowy 2.0 plays a key role in supporting the growth of renewable energy using its large-scale energy storage to provide clean, reliable and affordable electricity on-demand over sustained periods,” the spokesperson said.“The Albanese government is extremely disappointed that the Coalition hid delays to Snowy 2.0 while in government, which have now been captured in the latest Aemo report.”Bowen’s opposition counterpart, Ted O’Brien, said the delays were linked to more global problems.“It’s clear that Snowy 2.0 has not been immune from supply chain shocks experienced across the world,” O’Brien said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He pointed to the mayor’s legal obligation to improve air quality in the capital.Conservative strategists believe they can use discontent about the Ulez in last week’s byelection as a weapon to save a raft of Tories under threat in the city’s outskirts.Rishi Sunak has indicated the government could delay or even abandon green policies that impose a direct cost on consumers as he attempts to create dividing lines with Labour at the next election.Downing Street said the government would “continually examine and scrutinise” measures including a ban on new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, phasing out gas boilers by 2035, energy efficiency targets for private rented homes and low-traffic neighbourhoods.Further questions have been raised about Labour’s commitment to measures to tackle the climate crisis after Starmer delayed plans for his £28bn green investment fund by two years because of economic turmoil.In BBC Radio 5 Live phone-in, Starmer said: “I want [Khan] to reflect on the impact it’s having on people … to look at the scheme and see whether there are things that can be done to make it easier for people.“The first is the scrappage scheme, the money that people get if they actually change their car. The government has put money behind similar schemes in Birmingham and Bristol but not in London. A proper scrappage scheme massively helps people. But the government at the moment won’t do it. That’s one measure, but I want the mayor to look more broadly.”However, Starmer added: “We can’t pretend that this is a simple political decision. You can’t just say yes/no without regard to the legal context. If the law requires a measure to be taken, it is not in the gift of the mayor to say ‘I’m simply not going to do it’.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is an ingredient found in commonly used herbicide brands such as Roundup or Gallup.Slug pellets also seemed to have an impact on bird sightings; in gardens where metaldehyde slug pellets were used, house sparrow numbers were down by almost 40%.Researchers drew on data gathered by the British Trust for Ornithology, which organises Garden BirdWatch – a citizen science garden bird recording scheme – and found that 32% of respondents used pesticides on their gardens, and that glyphosate-based herbicides made up 53% of those applications.Prof Dave Goulson, of the school of life sciences at the University of Sussex, said: “The UK has 22 million gardens, which collectively could be a fantastic refuge for wildlife, but not if they are overly tidy and sprayed with poisons. We just don’t need pesticides in our gardens. Many towns around the world are now pesticide free. We should simply ban the use of these poisons in urban areas, following the example of France.”The Royal Horticultural Society, the UK’s leading gardening charity, says the use of pesticides and herbicides should be avoided if possible and they should only be used, if ever, in small and targeted applications.The research also found that those who adopted wildlife-friendly practices such as planting native shrubs and flowers, or digging a wildlife pond, saw more birds than those who did not.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Researchers have uncovered a new genus of butterfly, with distinctive orange wings and dark eyespots. It is a striking appearance that has led the international team to label the genus Saurona, after Sauron, the evil lord of Mordor whose all-seeing fiery eye brought terror to Middle-earth and the Shires in The Lord of the Rings.It is an intriguing monicker. As JRR Tolkien describes it: “The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself glazed, yellow as a cat’s, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing.”And the two species that form the new genus – Saurona triangula and Saurona aurigera – are certainly distinctive with their eyelike markings of vivid orange and jet black, although they are unlikely to invoke quite as much terror as Mordor’s cruel ruler. They are relatively small even by butterfly standards. Nevertheless, their discovery and naming is important, say scientists.The Eye of Sauron from the 2001 film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Photograph: New Line Cinema/Allstar“Butterflies are under enormous pressure from habitat loss, and we desperately need to identify and study new species before time runs out for them,” said Blanca Huertas of the Natural History Museum in London. “By giving them unusual names we can bring attention to what is happening to butterflies, which are in real trouble across the world today.”In the UK, three-quarters of all butterfly species are now believed to be in decline, while across the globe they are similarly threatened thanks to widespread habitat destruction, pesticides and accelerating climate change.Huertas is a member of an international group of researchers that has spent more than 10 years tracking down new butterfly species. Other scientists involved in the project are based at Harvard University and the Florida Museum of Natural History.This global project has taken more than a decade to complete and has assessed more than 400 species of butterflies using advanced DNA analysis and other techniques. These have allowed scientists to achieve a new understanding of butterflies, in particular of the sub-tribe known as Euptychiina.At present, only two species of butterfly of the genus Saurona have been discovered. However, it is thought that many more undiscovered species exist in the wild.“Essentially, naming them after key fictional characters helps to pique people’s interest in them, and that is important for their conservation,” added Huertas.Being labelled after Sauron is a first for butterflies but not for other members of the animal kingdom. A dung beetle, a frog and a dinosaur have all been named after the ruler of Mordor. In addition, several dozen other creatures have been given tags that recall various Tolkien characters. These include Macrostyphlus gandalf, a species of weevil; Gollum attenuatus, a bottom-dwelling shark; and the Hairy-footed Moss Forest Blossom Bat of New Guinea, also known by its official name Syconycteris hobbit.Indeed, using Tolkien characters in scientific labels is now a common practice in science. For example, the Eye of Sauron has been used as a nickname for several astronomical objects, including distant galaxies and also the star system HR 4796A, and has even been employed to label an ancient undersea volcano discovered near Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean."

        "text": "National Highways has unveiled a new design for motorway gantries that it hopes will prove harder for protesters to mount and use to cause disruption.The renovated structures, which are expected to become the standard design in England from 2025, will have their maintenance steps hidden inside their pillars and will be more difficult to gain access to without authorisation.The agency said this would make them “more resilient to trespassers”, but it stressed that “security issues did not form part of the original specification”.Just Stop Oil activists scaled gantries above the M25 in November last year. Several stretches of the road were closed and arrests were made as members of the organisation protested against the climate emergency. One man, Jan Goodey, was handed a six-month sentence.A spokesperson for the group said: “Just Stop Oil have always said the disruption will end immediately when the government agrees to end new oil and gas. Until then we look forward to the challenges the new gantry designs provide.”National Highways launched a competition to replace the gantry designs last December, a month after the M25 protests.The competition, run in conjunction with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), was launched as part of a wider plan to “beautify” the design of the country’s busiest roads. Design guidance published by National Highways last July included recommendations such as “minimising clutter”, providing “clues” about how to drive, being sensitive to the local landscape and improving environmental sustainability. Entries were not expected to alter the technology that sits behind gantries.National Highways said: “Although security issues did not form part of the original specification, the new design will be more resilient to trespassers due to entry being concealed within the pillars, making it more difficult to access without authorisation.”The successful concept was produced by the London-based architecture company Useful Studio and chosen for its “simplicity and elegance”.National Highways’ executive director for operations, Duncan Smith, said: “This is a great opportunity for us to develop a more streamlined, elegant and consistent visual appearance for roadside gantries to enhance drivers’ experience when driving on England’s motorways and major A-roads.“Existing designs tend to emphasise function over form. Our challenge is to create innovative structures that can accommodate the required signage and equipment that are more sympathetic to the environment.”The new gantries will have a lower carbon footprint than the current designs as they will use less steel.Jonathan McDowell, an RIBA architect adviser, said: “It is very encouraging that National Highways is actively engaging the design community in helping to improve the design of these ubiquitous but cumbersome parts of the motorway experience. We enjoyed seeing a wide range of interesting ideas, including those which challenged National Highways’ current practices.”During last November’s protests, Just Stop Oil banners were draped from the overhead road structures. National Highways said at the time that the structures need “a degree of accessibility” for maintenance crews."

        "text": "Marginal improvements to agricultural soils around the world would store enough carbon to keep the world within 1.5C of global heating, new research suggests.Farming techniques that improve long-term fertility and yields can also help to store more carbon in soils but are often ignored in favour of intensive techniques using large amounts of artificial fertiliser, much of it wasted, that can increase greenhouse gas emissions.Using better farming techniques to store 1% more carbon in about half of the world’s agricultural soils would be enough to absorb about 31 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide a year, according to new data. That amount is not far off the 32 gigatonnes gap between current planned emissions reduction globally per year and the amount of carbon that must be cut by 2030 to stay within 1.5C.The estimates were carried out by Jacqueline McGlade, the former chief scientist at the UN environment programme and former executive director of the European Environment Agency. She found that storing more carbon in the top 30cm of agricultural soils would be feasible in many regions where soils are currently degraded.McGlade now leads a commercial organisation that sells soil data to farmers. Downforce Technologies uses publicly available global data, satellite images and lidar to assess in detail how much carbon is stored in soils, which can now be done down to the level of individual fields.“Outside the farming sector, people do not understand how important soils are to the climate,” said McGlade. “Changing farming could make soils carbon negative, making them absorb carbon, and reducing the cost of farming.”She said farmers could face a short-term cost while they changed their methods, away from the overuse of artificial fertiliser, but after a transition period of two to three years their yields would improve and their soils would be much healthier.She estimated it would cost about $1m (£790,000) to restore 40,000 hectares (99,000 acres) of what is currently badly degraded farmland in Kenya, an area that is home to about 300,000 people.Downforce data could also allow farmers to sell carbon credits based on how much additional carbon dioxide their fields are absorbing. Soil has long been known to be one of Earth’s biggest stores of carbon, but until now it has not been possible to examine in detail how much carbon soils in particular areas are locking up and how much they are emitting. About 40% of the world’s farmland is now degraded, according to UN estimates.Carbon dioxide removal, the name given to a suite of technologies and techniques that increase the uptake of carbon dioxide from the air and sequester the carbon in some form, is an increasing area of interest, as the world slips closer to the critical threshold of 1.5C of global heating above pre-industrial levels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Livestock farmers could improve their soils by growing more native grasses.Hedgerows also help to sequester carbon in the soil, because they have large underground networks of mycorrhizal fungi and microbes that can extend metres into the field. Farmers have spent decades removing hedgerows to make intensive farming easier, but restoring them, and maintaining existing hedgerows, would improve biodiversity, reduce the erosion of topsoil, and help to stop harmful agricultural runoff, which is a key polluter of rivers."

        "text": "A conflict between saving carbon and building better homes has broken out on a groundbreaking 1960s council estate in London.The London borough of Camden is planning to raze and replace the West Kentish Town estate, which was built almost 60 years ago. It says the homes are too small, the concrete panel buildings are dilapidated and most residents want new homes.But a rival plan backed by some residents to retrofit the homes proposes adding insulation, reconfiguring internal walls and adding balconies to produce a climate impact estimated at six times smaller.The masterplan for the new estate has been drawn up by the architects Allford Hall Monaghan Morris, the firm of Simon Allford, the president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. The rival scheme has been devised by Alice Brown, who was funded to do so by the RIBA.View from Warden RoadThe row comes as the Green party accused the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, of funding the demolition of about 1,000 homes in the capital – including at Kentish Town – on the basis they are “obsolete” when they are not. There is growing pressure on architects and developers to reuse concrete structures, rather than rebuild, to avoid greater climate impact.Khan had sought to avoid using City Hall cash to fund projects where homes are demolished only to be replaced. But if existing homes are defined as “obsolete” projects can still claim grants. Siân Berry, the leader of the Greens in the London assembly, said this had given councils and housing associations too much leeway to write off homes that appeared to be usable in at least 10 boroughs.“It is a scandal that so many homes are being condemned to the wrecking ball unfairly by councils and housing associations when most of the problems residents are facing with cold and damp homes are down to simple neglect and lack of maintenance,” she said.View from Rhyl StreetBrown believes her retrofit plan would result in 16,000 tonnes of embodied carbon dioxide, compared with about 100,000 tonnes under the larger demolition and rebuild.A spokesperson for Khan said: “London has some of the country’s oldest housing stock and not every home can be refurbished. In some cases, it is more sustainable to carefully dismantle a building, maximising reuse of building materials, as mandated by the London plan, and replacing it with one that’s more energy-efficient, with lower operational carbon emissions.”Camden council last summer agreed a plan to replace the 316-home West Kentish Town estate with 885 replacements – up to 60% of which will be for private sale. The cabinet heard from residents about poor conditions, no lifts, balconies, damp and leaks. In 2020, 93% of residents voted in favour of redevelopment.The homes were built in 1964 on the site of century-old terraces built for workers constructing the railways. Commentators said it was one of the country’s first “fully considered ‘industrialised’ environments”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is so cold in winter time. We put the heater on but it doesn’t get warm.”A spokesperson for Camden said “cramped homes, deteriorating 1960s blocks that made homes susceptible to cold, damp and disrepair, a need for more affordable and larger homes” meant retrofit would not work. They added it was likely to be “financially unviable”.The new homes would probably feature air source heat pumps and solar panels on rooftops to cut carbon emissions when in use."

This Christmas, I’m making mulled wine pouches using warming spices and saved-up dried ginger and citrus peel, which I’ve dried above the oven. Spices are better bought whole, rather than ground, because they stay fresher that way. Even so, they, too, will lose potency over time, so it’s a good idea to rotate them, making sure older spices get used up before you buy replacements. (At home, we keep a “use-next” box of dried ingredients on the countertop, which often doubles up as inspiration for our next meal.)Mulled wine spice pouchThis makes a sweet little gift and is a great way to use up store-cupboard ingredients. If you want to be really generous, gift the other mulled wine ingredients, too, be that the wine, honey or maple syrup, orange juice or even a bottle of spirits. Note that all the ingredients for the pouch are optional – I’ve included a long list in the hope that you’ll have at least some of them to hand. Like chai tea, mulled wine recipes vary greatly, and are delicious even when made with just a few spices.Makes 12 cups (ie, when mixed with two bottles of wine)For the spice pouch4-6 cloves2 bay leaves1 small cinnamon stick2-3 star anise3-6 cardamom pods6 black peppercorns1 thin slice nutmeg2-4cm piece dried ginger peel3 pieces dried citrus peel3 pieces dried fruit (prunes, figs and/or apricots, say)4cm piece vanilla podFor the mulled wine350ml orange juice, or water4-6 tbsp honey, maple syrup or sugar (optional)2 x 750ml bottles red wine50-100ml spirit – brandy, whisk or gin (optional)To make the mulled wine pouch, put a combination of all the ingredients in the centre of a piece of cheesecloth or muslin, then tie up neatly to seal, so it looks a bit like an old money bag; note that all the ingredients are optional, so adjust the quantities to suit your own taste.To make the mulled wine, pour the orange juice (or water) into a small saucepan and add the honey, maple syrup or sugar, if using, to taste.

The period also covers an official overseas trip during Liz Truss’s brief tenure, during which she took a private jet to and from a meeting in Prague that cost almost £40,000.While Downing Street sometimes has access to an RAF Voyager plane, a mid-air refuelling craft that has had its interior fitted out to carry passengers, all the flights listed involved an Airbus A-321 operated by the charter carrier Titan Airways on behalf of the UK government.The plane is painted with a union flag tail fin, and is a de facto equivalent to the official aircraft used by some other world leaders.Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrats’ energy and climate spokesperson, said: “This is a shocking waste of taxpayers’ money at a time when people are struggling to pay their bills. Yet again this Conservative government is completely out of touch.“The government can pretend to care about a greener future with their so-called ‘green day’ but the reality is they are trashing their own promises.”The Cabinet Office costings document shows nearly another £20,000 was spent on other costs for the prime ministers, including accommodation, meals and visas.This does not include the costs for officials who also went on the trips. The delegations varied in size from the 19 who accompanied Truss to Prague to the 35 who joined Sunak in Bali.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is expected that will grow to 40% by December.But the picture is different for large-scale renewable projects. The regulator has downgraded its expectations amid rising costs for components, engineering and construction.In contrast to the uplift in small-scale renewables, Parker said it was a quiet first half of the year for new large-scale renewable energy investment commitments.“We’ve downgraded our expectations and now expect 2023 investment may not reach three gigawatts,” Parker said.It follows warnings from experts that the sector is not moving at a fast enough pace to meet an 82% renewable energy target by 2030.The Australian Energy Market Operator warned in June that the country’s transition away from fossil fuels was moving too slowly with not enough investment in wind and solar farms.The regulator said finding ways to streamline grid connection and fast-track new transmission would be critical.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For the remaining Londoners still driving non-compliant vehicles, millions of pounds of scrappage scheme support is still available.”Analysis showed 37,200 London-based drivers have received payouts totalling £121m from the scrappage scheme to trade in non-compliant vehicles.The TfL director of strategy and policy, Christina Calderato, said the figures showed that the Ulez was “highly effective in taking the oldest, most polluting vehicles off the roads”.She added: “We know that tackling London’s toxic air is crucial to ensuring the health of those who live in the capital and that the greatest number of deaths attributable to air pollution occur in outer London.”Analysis of how much the expanded Ulez has affected air pollution in the capital is due to be published after six months of operation, with the data collected from 150 monitoring stations over a longer term to allow for factors such as weather."

Uptake for the project, a digital deposit return scheme (DDRS) in which citizens get 10p for every container they recycle, has been good with 1,300 of the 4,300 households eligible signing up and 25,000 containers set to be processed.The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, who visited on Wednesday, said: “We’re committed to introducing a deposit return scheme in Wales and it’s important we explore the different ways a scheme could be delivered.“Wales is the third best country in the world for recycling but we need to go further if we are to reach net zero and tackle littering. The learning from this trial will help us better understand recycling patterns.”A can is held above a bag of recyclable material collected in a machine at the Morrisons supermarket in Brecon.

They can then recycle the containers in their normal Powys county council kerbside collection bin or at community points.Participants can also take containers to automated machines at a supermarket or leisure centre or hand them over to assistants at some stores.The drinks containers with the 10p sticker will not cost more than normal as the reward is being funded by the sponsors, which include retailers in Brecon, packaging companies and some drinks brands as well as the government.Participant can scan stickers on the containers using their phone and earn 10p a time. Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena PicturesNellie Salter, the trial supervisor, said they had been pleased by how many people had taken part and were testing things such as how people preferred to return containers (it turned out to be via their kerbside bins) and if people tried to defraud the system.Challenges had included the sometimes ropey mobile phone coverage, and there was an unexpected spike when, during the town’s jazz festival, youngsters realised there was cash to be made.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The fee was intended to cover the cost of producing the low-carbon gas instead of polluting fossil fuels.But the energy security secretary has now said he does not support a “levy directly on households”, signalling a possible U-turn as households struggle with high inflation and this week’s shock interest rate rise. Instead, he said, it should be paid for “further up the chain”.“What we need to do is make sure that, A, we can get our hydrogen industry up and running. Really, really important, massive export opportunities, great way to store energy, great way to power heavy industry and what have you,” he told the Daily Telegraph.“And, B, I don’t want to see people’s household bills unnecessarily bashed by this.”The thinktank Onward has estimated the levy would increase energy bills by about £118 a year for the average dual fuel household.Shapps said he supported other ways of moving towards cleaner energy and net zero, which he said could include passing the costs on to the energy industry or general taxation.The law’s wording would ensure the cost would not be applied directly to bills, he said.“The fuss was because there was a clause in the energy bill which would take powers to [impose a hydrogen levy], though not actually legislate,” he told the newspaper. “But I’m going to make sure that, whatever that clause is, it makes it clear that’s not a levy directly on households. The way that’s funded will have to be further up the chain.”Discussions between his department, No 10 and the Treasury aim to reach a conclusion on the new approach, according to the Telegraph, with an alternative funding scheme hoped to be agreed before the parliamentary recess next month.The hydrogen levy plans prompted a backlash from within his own party and opposition MPs, who fear further bill increases amid the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis.Labour claimed the move was an attempt to avoid a Tory backbench rebellion.Alan Whitehead, a shadow energy minister, said: “This is yet another humiliating U-turn for Rishi Sunak, showing that his government is completely out of touch with reality.“During a cost of living crisis, millions of families are already struggling to make ends meet and yet the government have been doggedly pursuing these regressive levies for months, only to finally back down over fears of a rebellion from their own backbenches.”He said Labour would instead overhaul Britain’s “broken” energy system and “deliver the green transition we so desperately need, energy security and bills that are affordable”."

Airlines will need to start thinking about how they will manage the increased turbulence, as it costs the industry $150-500m annually in the USA alone.”Previous studies have suggested that a climate that is heating up could increase turbulence but Prof Paul Williams, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading and co-author of the research, said it was the first evidence it was already happening.“We should be investing in improved turbulence forecasting and detection systems, to prevent the rougher air from translating into bumpier flights in the coming decades,” he said.The rapidly changing climate is already known to be affecting air travel. A faster jet stream across the Atlantic is increasing travel times and rising temperatures are reducing the weight aircraft can carry. At the same time carbon emissions from aviation are a significant driver of the climate crisis.The study, published in the Geophysical Research Letters journal, found that at a typical point over the north Atlantic – one of the world’s busiest flight routes – the total annual duration of severe turbulence increased by 55% from 17.7 hours in 1979 to 27.4 hours in 2020. Moderate turbulence increased by 37% from 70.0 to 96.1 hours, and light turbulence increased by 17% from 466.5 to 546.8 hours.The authors said that while the US and north Atlantic had experienced the largest increases, other busy flight routes over Europe, the Middle East and the south Atlantic also recorded significant increases in turbulence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They have provided guidance on everything from hydropower dam construction in Nepal to farm diversification in Ethiopia.Alongside private consultancies, the UK’s climate finance is also spent via large international bodies such as the World Bank, UN agencies, development banks and NGOs.Much of the money administered by these groups goes directly to projects, although all of them take cuts along the way to pay for staff and other expenses. Nevertheless, experts say the large scale involvement of private consultancies can lead to the money being used less effectively, adding there is growing opposition to climate aid being funnelled through these companies rather than groups with local contacts and expertise.Clare Shakya, a climate finance expert at the International Institute for Environment and Development, said the least developed countries and small-island states in particular had pushed for funding for more long-term climate action rather than the project-based activities consultancies often supported.She said: “The poorest and most climate-impacted countries are clear that business as usual in climate finance is not working for them. Short-term projects driven by external experts are failing to provide the support they need to transform to low-carbon development and greater climate resilience.”The UK government has scaled up its spending on consultants and made it easier for public sector bodies to hire them in recent years. At the same time, their role in public life has been under growing scrutiny. Academics, politicians and officials have criticised the outsourcing of responsibilities to expensive private contractors.Responding to these concerns during her speech at the Labour party conference this week, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, vowed to slash consultancy spending by half if her party won the next election.Carbon Brief’s analysis looked at more than 25,000 transactions listed on the government’s development tracker website from projects that contribute to the UK’s International Climate Finance.Both KPMG and PwC declined to comment on Carbon Brief’s findings or the criticism of consultancies running climate-finance projects. They also declined to share information on how much money they retained as fees for their services on these projects.The UK government declined to comment on its use of consultancies to administer climate-finance projects.A spokesperson for Adam Smith International said it did not recognise the figures in the Carbon Brief analysis. They added the consultancy “ardently ensures optimal value for money in [its] projects”, with “competitively and responsibly structured” fees and “transparency in [its] financial dealings, including profitability and expenditure”. They also said the organisation “places a paramount emphasis on both leveraging and strengthening local capacities in all our projects”, with the “majority” of ASI funds being used to engage national consultants and partnering with local groups."

        "text": "Greater Manchester has approved plans for a clean air zone (CAZ) scheme under which high-polluting commercial and passenger vehicles will be charged to drive through the city.High-polluting heavy goods vehicles, buses and coaches will be charged £60 a day; vans, £10; and taxi and private hire vehicles, £7.50 to drive within the zone. Failure to pay will result in a £120 fine in addition to the daily charge. Private cars will be exempt. The scheme is expected to be rubber-stamped at a meeting of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) next week and is expected to launch on 30 May 2022.The scope of the plans immediately came under fire after they were announced on Monday. Andrea Lee, clean air campaigner at environmental law charity ClientEarth, said: “The proposed zone remains blind to the biggest source of air pollution in the region: private cars.“With cities like London and Birmingham already taking action to tackle all the most polluting vehicles, Greater Manchester’s plan pales in comparison– and people’s health will continue to suffer.”Andy Burnham, the regional mayor, said: “Greater Manchester … are leading a green revolution, backed with over £120m that we’ve secured to hand over to businesses to support making their vehicles compliant.“It’s the poorest kids in the poorest communities that have to breathe in the most polluted air. Every year in Greater Manchester, over 1,000 deaths have air pollution as a contributory cause. It’s just not something we should ignore any more. ”The government has ordered all 10 Greater Manchester councils to introduce a clean air zone by 2024. Illegally high levels of roadside air pollution have been recorded in all 10 boroughs of Greater Manchester.Birmingham’s equivalent CAZ scheme, launched this month, has begun issuing daily charges to high-polluting cars, taxis and vans after a two-week delay to give motorists “time to adjust”.Applications for funds to help Greater Manchester businesses upgrade to cleaner, compliant vehicles are due to open in November.“As a result of the funding package that we have secured, we are now able to give people more time to change their vehicle to a non-polluting compliant one,” Burnham said. “We’re also putting forward more options for people in terms of how they make the change, including retrofitting their vehicles.”The CAZ is a pillar of plans for an integrated “Bee Network” across Greater Manchester. Burnham confirmed that the bike-share company Beryl would be responsible for the city’s cycle hire scheme, which will also form part of the network.There will be 1,500 bikes and e-bikes at more than 200 cycle hire docking stations across Manchester, Trafford and Salford by mid-2022.Chris Boardman, former Olympic cyclist and Greater Manchester’s transport commissioner, said: “Today is a major milestone for the city-region: not only do we have a solid plan to make vehicles on our roads cleaner, we’ll soon be bringing cycle hire to our streets, providing a healthy, convenient, non-polluting transport option for tens of thousands of people.”"

And when you do need to cook more, make extra portions for the freezer.Favour stove-top cooking over the oven, use the right-sized pan, with a lid. Invest in a pressure cooker to cut cooking times in half. Steam veg instead of boiling it, to save both water-soluble vitamins, energy and water.When you do use the oven, fill it with other get-ahead dishes, don’t open the door unless necessary and turn it off 10 minutes before the end of the cooking time, to make use of the residual heat.No-bake coconut lemon ‘cheesecake’This plant-based “cheesecake” isn’t just for vegans, because the combination of coconut butter and blended cashew nuts is to die for: creamy, unctuous and satisfying. Unlike most cheesecakes, this one doesn’t need an oven or any heat source to make it, saving both time and energy. It will keep in the freezer for two to three months, or in the fridge for a three to five days.

Cold conditions may also encourage less frequent garden visitors to turn up at bird feeders, including redpolls and bramblings.A YouGov poll commissioned by the RSPB found that 88% of UK adults said spending time outdoors enjoying the natural world was important to them, with 53% stating it was very important, while 91% agreed that seeing birds and hearing birdsong had a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing.Spending time in woodlands, wetlands and other natural spaces has been shown by various studies to improve mental health and wellbeing.Dr Amir Khan, the president of the RSPB, said: “Working as a GP, I know just how important accessing green spaces is for our physical and mental wellbeing. Watching the blue tits and bullfinches enjoying the feeders in my garden is a constant source of comfort for me, and being on the frontline of the NHS I am very aware that comfort is something we all need now more than ever.”Over four decades, Big Garden Birdwatch has alerted scientists to rises and falls in bird species. Last year’s sightings data pointed to a revival for the disease-hit greenfinch, while over the decades the survey also first noted the precipitous decline in song thrushes, which are down 81% compared with the first Big Garden Birdwatch in 1979. It was 20th in the rankings last year, seen in just 8% of gardens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Areas of Spain and Portugal have recorded daily maximum temperatures in the high 30s celsius for more than a week, exceeding 40C in parts of southern Spain on Sunday. Italy, France, Germany and the Benelux region also reached the low- to mid-30s celsius in places at the weekend.The heat is caused by a large area of high pressure that is stagnating over Europe and preventing the usual pattern of low pressure systems moving eastwards into Europe from the Atlantic. This is known as a blocking high and results in very dry and stable conditions, as the fronts associated with more dynamic weather patterns are forced away by the high pressure.This phenomenon has triggered a heat dome, in which warm air is trapped under the blocking high. The pressure acts like a lid, forcing rising warm air to sink, compressing it slightly and raising its temperature as a result. The heating effect is also exacerbated by the dry conditions, as drier air is able to heat quicker than humid air.The heat dome is likely to expand as it strengthens in the coming days, possibly spreading as far north-east as central Europe and bringing highs of more than 30C to parts of the continent each day. Spain will be particularly badly affected and is likely to hit the low- to mid-40s celsius daily, particularly across southern regions.Canada has also been experiencing unusually high temperatures in recent days, with a new peak recorded by a weather station in Fort Good Hope in the Northwest Territories on Saturday. The station, just outside the Arctic Circle at about 66°N, recorded 36.7C (98.1F), a record for that far north in Canada. With similarly high temperatures forecast this week for parts of the Northwest Territories, further records could be broken.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Photograph: Cornelius Poppe/NTB/AFP/Getty Images“Most counties in southern Norway will be affected to a greater or lesser extent,” the institute said. The danger warning was in place from Monday morning until Tuesday evening.Strong winds and rain continued across the region, also causing disruption, cancelling ferries, delaying flights, uprooting trees, flooding streets and also causing outages across Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden.In Oslo, people were urged to work from home and to avoid unnecessary journeys.In Valdres, some residents had to be airlifted by helicopter after there were several landslides. In the village of Bagn, Norwegian broadcaster NRK reported that a house and garage had been destroyed after a landslide hit a housing estate, and authorities warned there could still be further incidents.And in Asak, about 1,000 residents were completely cut off from the outside world by flooding. The only route remaining was reportedly a forest path along which food supplies will have to be delivered.Mud and logs are washed down a slope hitting several residential buildings in Bagn, near Valdres, seen on 8 August.

There is reason to expect that this will last another day.”Text messages were sent out to tourists on holiday in the country warning them about the weather.The Norwegian water resources and energy directorate warned of “extremely heavy rainfall” in the south of the country. “Unnecessary traffic should be avoided,” it added.On Monday a 50-year-old woman in Lithuania and a man in Latvia were killed by falling trees. In central Sweden, a train was partly derailed owing to a washed-away embankment, injuring three.Elsewhere in Sweden, there were reports of chaotic scenes around Åre, a ski resort, where much of the town was flooded after a river burst its banks.00:00:52Swedish ski resort suffers severe flooding after river bursts its banks – video reportThe Swedish meteorological and hydrological institute issued a red warning for Halland and parts of Småland for Tuesday and Wednesday.The institute said Hans had also brought in warm air across the north, leading to tropical nights in multiple locations in Norrland. On Tuesday, Haparanda recorded a temperature of 30.2C – its highest August temperature since 1969.Meanwhile, in Estonia, nearly 10,000 people were left without power.In Denmark, waves of up to eight metres were reported and beach houses were washed into the North Sea.In Finland, authorities urged people to reconsider whether they needed to go out to sea."

A prologue set in the Cretaceous period hints that Meg 2: The Trench will exceed the enjoyably tacky thrills of the 2018 seaborne monster movie by going weirder and wilder – a suspicion encouraged by the presence of Ben Wheatley (Sightseers, A Field in England) as director. In fact, the sequel alternately treads water and splashes around frantically in search of an identity. Never settling on whether he wants his film to be Alien, Jaws, Jurassic Park or Sharknado, Wheatley serves up a bouillabaisse of all four.Battling a 75ft-long megalodon with an 8ft dorsal fin and five rows of teeth is another sort of formidable, remorseless beast: Jason Statham, who returns as shark-hunter and ocean-defender Jonas Taylor but still hasn’t decided whether to play the role with a cockney accent or an American one. While he’s mulling that over, he commandeers a submersible on a research trip 25,000ft below, only to find the mission gatecrashed by megs and other assorted sea monsters. It’s the multiplicity of threats that scuppers any possible scares: everything from a giant squid and velociraptor-like land-dwelling lizards to a double-crossing entrepreneur and a gang of rogue miners leave the meg playing second fiddle in its own film. Matters have come to a pretty pass when audience and characters alike see an exploding head as little more than a minor setback.Intermittent pleasures include a knowing reference to Jaws 2 and a Little Shop of Horrors-style shot gazing out from inside an open mouth, as well as plenty of “Hell no!” interjections from the endearing Page Kennedy as resident tech guy, DJ. And the film keeps Statham busy, whether he is taking to jet-skis for an impromptu midsea jousting tournament or scrambling along a pier as it’s being masticated. His deathless way with a line reading can still raise a smile. “Great – more megs,” is no one’s idea of snappy dialogue but his unimpressed cadence lifts it into the realm of the droll.It’s just a shame the film makes him spend so much time playing dad to a teenage sort-of stepdaughter, Meiying (Sophia Cai). Along with her uncle, Jiuming (Wu Jing), who thinks he can tame a megalodon, they end the film as a sitcom trio, suggesting a potential new direction for the third instalment. A radical rethink is needed, that’s for sure. Anyone for Meg vs M3GAN? Meg 2: The Trench is released on 4 August in the UK and the US"

The local Tory MP Johnny Mercersaid the decision to fell the trees was a factor in the loss. “The way the Conservative council did it, particularly at night – I obviously would have done it differently,” he said.Now, the Labour-controlled council hopes to salvage the area. The new scheme will include a “play village” for children made of the wood from the felled trees. There will be water fountains for young people to play in during the summer, as well as play apparatus.The council has consulted biodiversity specialists and chosen 16 species to plant, including silver birch, field maple, Turkish hazel and Judas trees. The area will also be used to help assuage pollution from the city’s rainwater, will include a new surface water drainage system powered by solar panels and will recycle the water to maintain the plants and trees.Evans said: “The trees will be about eight metres high and they’ll have a big girth around the trunk of up to 35cm, so they’re not little spindly things that you sometimes see planned. These are going to be ready to go.”Because of the technical aspects of the scheme including lighting, CCTV and the drainage system, it will take about 70 weeks to complete, but some parts including vegetation will be installed sooner, he said.Evans said hewas most excited about the play area: “There’s going to be places where kids can climb, swing, run and jump and have fun and so it’ll be a destination playground, something that people will come into the city centre for and and stay and it’ll be great for families. I’ve got grandchildren and I just think they’re going to love it.”"

But there was no hiding the disappointment of environmentalists.Tatiana Santos, the head of chemicals policy at the European Environmental Bureau (EEB), a network of environmental citizens’ organisations, said that by shelving the promised review of the EU’s Reach regulation that governs chemicals, “the European Commission has betrayed European citizens, turning a blind eye to chemical pollution and favoured toxic industry’s short-term interests over those of its citizens. It is now clear that the profits of the chemical industry are more important to this commission than the health of Europeans. The European Green Deal will be remembered as the European Toxic Deal.”Europe has almost 23% of the world’s new cancer cases despite making up only 6% of the world’s population, in part because of “chronic exposure to some pharmaceuticals, pollutants and other occupational and environmental carcinogens”, according to the European Environment Agency.In 2020, the EU released a chemicals strategy that called for “banning the most harmful chemicals in consumer products – allowing their use only where essential”. It also committed the EU to “phasing out the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the EU, unless their use is essential.”PFAS – also known as forever chemicals – accumulate in nature and in our bodies where they can damage the endocrine, immune and reproductive systems. The substances can take thousands of years or longer to degrade, and their health costs are estimated at €52-84bn (£45-73bn) a year.The planned ban would have taken thousands of the most hazardous products off the market but it is now unclear whether the proposals will be mothballed or buried.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It can be fastened with a pin in the stem, worn in a buttonhole, or a stick-on version is available.The Royal British Legion had previously faced criticism over the amount of plastic waste created by the commemorative poppies. The flower will now be made of “upcycled fibre”, made from offcuts from paper cup production, and the fresh fibre is wood pulp from FSC certified forestry sources. The Royal British Legion says the new poppy’s carbon footprint is 40% lower than the previous design owing to the increase in recycled paper used.Andy Taylor-Whyte, poppy appeal director at the Royal British Legion, said: “After years of work and collaboration with our partners designing a new poppy, creating new paper and machinery and road-testing it for durability and colour-fastness, we have been able to eliminate single-use plastic and create a poppy that is an enduring symbol of respect and remembrance as well as being more planet-friendly.Prof Paola Lettieri, from University College London’s department of chemical engineering, which was involved with the redesign, said: “We looked at its carbon footprint and factors like how much water and resources go into making it, in what’s called a life-cycle assessment. By replacing the single-use plastic with a paper-based design, and increasing the amount of recycled paper used, UCL found that the new poppy design has a 40% smaller carbon footprint and a similar reduction in its overall impact on the environment.”The plastic-free poppy, which was created in collaboration with designers Matter and with paper supplier James Cropper, will be available alongside remaining stocks of the current poppy to reduce any waste of poppies already produced.The poppies raise money for the charity, which supports armed forces personnel, veterans, and their families on issues including homelessness, financial support and mental health.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wind generated 56% of Britain’s electricity, although this fell short of the record percentage of electricity generated from wind in a half-hour period, which was 69% on 19 November this year.Dan McGrail, the chief executive of RenewableUK, said: “Setting a new wind energy record is a great achievement to celebrate during this festive period. Wind power is taking centre stage in our modern clean energy mix, strengthening our energy security and keeping Britain powered up at the coldest, darkest time of the year.”Storm Pia has caused disruption across the UK, with gusts of up to 80mph in northern Britain blowing trees across rail lines.The news came as Germany’s RWE agreed to buy a vast collection of North Sea wind projects from Swedish power company Vattenfall for £963m. In July, Vattenfall halted work on the 1.4GW Norfolk Boreas offshore wind project in the North Sea, citing higher costs and “challenging market conditions”.RWE said it would buy the Norfolk Zone – three fully consented wind farms comprising Norfolk Boreas, Norfolk Vanguard West and Norfolk Vanguard East.One of the largest offshore wind developments in the world, it will eventually have a total capacity of 4.2GW, enough to power 4m homes.On Wednesday the Danish renewable energy firm Ørsted decided to push ahead with plans to build the world’s biggest windfarm off the coast of Norfolk.It made a final investment decision on the Hornsea 3 project off Britain’s coast, which will have capacity to power more than 3.3m homes and is expected to cost 70bn-75bn Danish kroner (£8.1bn-£8.7bn). It is due to be completed by the end of 2027.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Industry insiders said “disastrous” handling by the government had created a big shortfall in future renewable energy."

        "text": "In less than three decades, the UK must reach net zero to avoid the worst impacts of climate crisis for our economy and national security. We’re already halfway there, having almost halved our emissions since 1990. But to achieve this momentous goal, we must now build support for the individual policies required, while preserving the cross-party consensus on the need to act. Conservatives want to protect our planet, but that doesn’t mean they’ll agree on every policy campaigners propose to get there. The public wants the debate to focus on how, not if, we reach carbon neutrality.There is a conservative route to net zero. It’s not a contradiction in terms. The UK has a long and rich history of conservative environmentalism. In 1989, Margaret Thatcher became the first world leader to raise the spectre of climate change in a global context. Another Conservative prime minister, Theresa May, fired the starting gun on the race to net zero by 2050, enshrining the target in law.Overwhelmingly, Conservative voters back environmental action. A recent poll revealed that 73% back the net zero target – a higher proportion than among voters overall. YouGov’s tracker poll consistently shows they rank the environment as the fourth most important issue facing the country. Nearly nine in 10 support solar power and offshore wind. Almost two-thirds think the ban on onshore wind in England must end.Some Conservatives sceptical of net zero and the severity of climate change view environmental action as an electoral liability. They’re far from the majority, but they are an increasingly loud group. They’ve drawn the wrong conclusions from the Uxbridge byelection, where the Conservatives won on an anti-ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), not anti-environment, ticket. They’ve misunderstood cases of local backlash to poorly implemented low-traffic neighbourhoods. And they’ve misread the public’s rejection of Just Stop Oil’s divisive stunts as a wider rebuff of climate action.Like all voters, Conservatives want fair, affordable environmental policies that maximise benefits while limiting direct costs. Two-thirds of Conservative voters support green policies that don’t put the costs on ordinary people, while only 17% back them if they do result in costs. But polling shows the same is true of other policy priorities, such as health and crime. Politicians should ignore the extremes of disruptive protesters and climate sceptics who often dominate the media debate, and instead respond to people’s concern about climate crisis in a way that minimises the costs.View image in fullscreen‘Almost two-thirds of Conservative voters think the ban on onshore wind in England must end.’ Photograph: Nathan Stirk/Getty ImagesOn the right, sceptics can’t undo the consensus around climate change so instead target specific policies where the public case still needs to be won, such as the rollout of electric cars and heat pumps. We’ll need these two technologies to reach net zero, but the prices of both have yet to fall sufficiently. The answer isn’t to ditch them, but to use the market to make them the cheapest and best options. Bold government targets, early support through funding for research and development, subsidies, tax breaks and light regulation can spur businesses to innovate and deploy clean technologies.Just as we’ve scaled up renewables to provide more than 40% of our electricity today while making it the cheapest new energy source available, we need to do the same for electric vehicles and heat pumps. That’s why the zero-emission vehicle mandate and government grants to support low-carbon heating are so important.Tory peer Zac Goldmith says he could be tempted to back Labour on climateRead moreSimilarly, there needs to be a coherent Conservative approach to transport. Cars are the only realistic transport option in most parts of the country, which is why the electric vehicle transition is the essential policy for transport decarbonisation. Our cities and towns shouldn’t be anti-car, but also shouldn’t prioritise them above everything else, given the limits on road space and the impacts on communities and the environment.Instead, we need to focus on expanding people’s transport choices. Politicians should give people cheaper, greener travel methods, whether by improving public transport, carefully consulting on active travel infrastructure, or enabling innovative solutions like e-scooters. Most will choose them when provided, allowing those who need to drive to continue to do so.Conservative voters want to see environmental action. It needn’t be at odds with personal freedom or at great cost to the individual. There will be trade-offs, which will initially require a more active state than some are comfortable with. But they pale in comparison to the costs and demand for government intervention unchecked climate change would bring.\nSam Hall is the director of the Conservative Environment Network\n"

        "text": "A warming world is transforming some major snowfalls over mountains into extreme rain, worsening both dangerous flooding like the type that devastated Pakistan last year as well as long-term water shortages, a new study has found.Using rain and snow measurements since 1950 and computer simulations for future climate, scientists calculated that for every degree Fahrenheit the world warms, extreme rainfall at higher elevation increases by 8.3% (15% for every degree Celsius), according to a study in Wednesday’s journal Nature.Heavy rain in mountains causes a lot more problems than big snow, including flooding, landslides and erosion, scientists said. And the rain is not conveniently stored away like snowpack that can recharge reservoirs in spring and summer.“It is not just a far-off problem that is projected to occur in the future, but the data is actually telling us that it’s already happening and we see that in the data over the past few decades,” said lead author Mohammed Ombadi, a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory hydrologist and climate scientist.As the world has warmed to the brink of the 1.5C (2.7F) internationally agreed threshold to stem the worst effects of climate change, this study shows “every degree [Celsius] matters because it comes with an additional 15% increase” in extreme rain over mountains, Ombadi said. That per-degree rainfall boost in the mountains is more than twice the increase the rest of the world gets from warming air holding more water.The study looked at only the heaviest rains each year over six decades in the northern hemisphere, finding that as altitude rose, so did the turbocharging of rain. The biggest increase in rains were noticed at about 10,000ft (3,000 meters). That includes much of the American west, where Ombadi said “it’s very pronounced”, as well as parts of the Appalachian Mountains. Another big hotspot in Asia is the Himalayas, Tian Shan and Hindu Kush mountains, with the Alps also affected.About one in four people on Earth live in an area close enough to the mountains or downhill that extreme rain and flooding would hit them, Ombadi said.‘We have no dry land left’: impact of Pakistan floods to be felt for yearsRead moreIt means more of the type of flooding off the mountains that killed more than 1,700 people in Pakistan and put one-third of the country underwater, Ombadi said. But he noted that they have not studied Pakistan’s 2022 floods precisely so there may be some small differences.The study makes sense and “the implications are serious”, said UCLA climate hydrologist Park Williams, who was not part of the research. Scientists expect more precipitation with warmer temperatures, but heavy snow’s flooding impact is lessened because it takes time to melt and it is easier to monitor snowpack to see what’s happening, he said.“But as the proportion of mountain precipitation falling as snow decreases, flood hazards may enhance especially rapidly,” Williams said.In the American west it hits hard in two different ways, said study co-author Charuleka Varadharajan, a lab climate scientist and hydrologist.“This kind of extreme rainfall is going to make the floods worse. And then you’ve got to figure out where is that water going?” she said. “We have that situation right now in the Sierras with the Tulare Lake flooding and such a serious issue relating to that.”Snow, floods and wildlife in peril: grueling winter leaves Yosemite scarredRead moreThe flooding also can hurt food production, Ombadi said. He pointed to California department of agriculture estimates of $89m in crop and livestock losses from this year’s torrential rains.But in the long term, another problem is water supply. When the American west gets heavy snowfall in the winter, that snow melts slowly in spring and summer, filling reservoirs where it can be useful when it is needed later.“It’s going to decrease your snow, your water supply in the future,” Varadharajan said. “You’re going to have more short-term runoff leading to more floods and less snowpack that recharges the groundwater and the groundwater is ultimately what helps maintain stream flows.”"

I use the sweet celery heart, butt and leaves, which often go to waste, so save the stalks for any other dish you fancy. The mayo-style dressing is made from aquafaba instead of egg yolks.While testing the recipe, it struck me that it made sense to use the chickpeas in the dish, too, which transforms the salad into a one-bowl meal for two.A plant-based waldorf salad with chickpeas, celery leaves and aquafaba mayoI love the retro classic waldorf salad for it’s simplicity: the sour apples, sweet grapes and crunchy walnuts seem to complement each other perfectly, and those three key ingredients are amalgamated and transformed into something quite luxurious with just a generous dollop of mayonnaise dressing.I rarely make mayonnaise with eggs – I prefer to save them for better uses – and aquafaba makes a more than adequate substitute anyway, plus its residual chickpea flavour contributes to the overall savouriness of the salad. By adding the chickpeas themselves, too, you fill and bulk out the salad, and also add nutrition.

        "text": "The government has met less than half of its annual tree-planting target in England, MPs have found, putting net zero ambitions at risk.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) this year published what it called “ambitious” nature targets, a requirement under the Environment Act, including the goal of planting 30,000 hectares of woodland by March 2025. A report by the environmental audit committee (EAC) of cross-party MPs has found that this target was unlikely to be met.While the public sector is responsible for only a quarter of UK woodland, the report found there was not enough direction from the government for the private sector, which faces “unclear strategies and overly bureaucratic schemes”.Tree planting is crucial for meeting carbon and biodiversity targets, as well as for sustainability in the building industry. The EAC report says UK-sourced timber will help meet the growing demand for low-carbon construction materials.It adds that a significant expansion of woodland cover is required to compensate for predicted shortfalls in the supply of domestically produced softwood timber and to deliver the UK’s climate and environment goals. At present, the rate of planting is less than half of the government’s target.The report recommends that the government focus on tree planting for its upcoming and delayed land use framework, which is supposed to be a blueprint for how land is allocated in the UK. The Defra minister Mark Spencer recently hinted that it would be watered down, saying it would not be a “communist” document telling landowners what to do with their estates.The wrong species being planted could also be a disaster for nature, the report says, recommending that native broadleaves offer ideal habitats for nature, while conifers supply softwood for timber use. The committee found this balance was unlikely to be struck, as the UK Forestry Standard is not routinely monitored and Forestry England lacks the resource to do this.The committee said it was “disappointed to observe that Forestry England is not currently on track to contribute fully to national tree-planting targets: to date it has only planted 303 hectares against its own target of 2,000 hectares between 2021-2026. Ministers should also commission work to identify opportunities for woodland creation on the wider government estate.”The EAC chair, Philip Dunne, said: “The government’s target to plant 30,000 hectares of woodland in the UK by March 2025 is welcome, and by and large ministers appreciate the conflicting challenges and demands on woodland. But the committee is concerned that England is currently way off meeting its contribution to that UK-wide goal, and that the rate of planting must increase.”The Conservative MP added: “At the moment there are simply too many overlapping strategies that aim to cover tree-planting policies in the UK and in England, and there is little evidence of an overall vision for the timber sector. The numerous strategies are disjointed: what is required is an overarching, holistic strategy that sets a long-term vision for how different types of woodland will be used to deliver government’s goals.”A Defra spokesperson said: “Since the start of this parliament, we have planted or supported the planting of over 10.8m trees. Increasing tree cover is at the heart of our pledge to meet net zero ambitions, which is why we are investing £650m during this parliament in transforming England’s treescapes. We are also continuing to work on delivering our legal target to have 16.5% of England’s total land area covered by trees by 2050.“Tree-planting rates are now at record levels, but we know there is much more to do and will continue to work with partners in both the private and public sector at pace to increase the nation’s tree cover and boost the forestry sector – supporting domestic timber production, creating new jobs and improving biodiversity across the country.”"

These rapidly proliferating creatures have cute fuzz-sheathed pincers that look like Victorian ladies’ winter muffs, but they can pin down a prawn and rip off its shell with nary a tremor. Before the mitten crabs, the scare was about bedbugs. Before that it was evil AI and killer robots.

I got my current dose of Pirola – that’s the latest variant, not a sofa from the Wayfair catalogue – on the tube. It was noticeable how many passengers were sneezing, wheezing, dripping, sniffling and generally letting their insides out. I moved away, but it was too late. Now I have heart flutters, chest tightness, fatigue, hives and such low appetite that all my ribs are showing. Since the government seems to think Covid is the Voldemort of virology – it is superstitiously fearful of saying the name out loud – I’m going to step in with a plea.

For all her greed and avarice, the witch ends up being melted into oblivion by a bucket of water.The Wizard of Oz is a wonderfully strange film.

The headless body also gets up and starts chasing her.It all hammers home the point that you’re not supposed to steal from Oz in the first place.

Three of SWW’s reservoirs fell to record lows during the drought.UK butterfly count could show fall in numbers after 2022 droughtRead moreThe agency said the company showed complacency before the drought and “a lack of understanding of their own supply system”.Documents obtained by Greenpeace’s investigations website Unearthed under freedom of information laws revealed the environmental watchdog’s scathing assessment of the water company’s drought preparedness. “SWW were not honest, open and transparent with regulators about their drought projections and potential risks to security of supply,” the EA wrote in a July email to Ofwat. The email said “SWW acted too late” in response to the drought, and that this “presented a genuine risk of loss of supply in west Cornwall”.The EA said the company had a misunderstanding of its own supplies and thought it had so much water that it could pipe it to other regions. The agency told Ofwat SWW that showed “a lack of understanding of their own supply system, considering themselves as a potential water donor in the future, only to find the reverse is true”. The company’s latest plan states that it needs to close a gap of more than 200m litres of water a day by 2050 to meet demand.Water was so scarce in 2022 that drastic saving measures banning all non-critical use were almost put in place. This would have meant a ban on ponds and swimming pools being refilled, people washing their cars and non-residential buildings being cleaned.No new reservoirs have been built in the UK since the water industry was privatised in 1989, and some water companies have added to their profits by selling off existing facilities. Water companies have paid out £72bn in dividends since privatisation, borrowing £56bn and increasing bills by 40%.The EA told Ofwat that new water sources need to “be considered, applied for and permitted during the drought instead of planned in advance”.Megan Corton Scott, a political campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “South West Water have failed in tackling the sewage crisis, failed to prepare for drought, failed to even understand their own supply system and failed to be honest with the regulator, but they did succeed in raising shareholder dividends at the end of last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "More than 4,000 of England’s vital flood defences are so damaged they are almost useless, including hundreds in areas battered by Storm Babet.Nearly 800 critical assets – defined as those where there is a high risk to life and property – were in a “poor” or “very poor” condition in the 10 English counties worst affected by last week’s historic downpours.The analysis will add to growing anger from flood-hit communities who have accused the authorities of being ill-equipped and complacent in the run-up to Storm Babet.It comes as Britain braces for yet more heavy rain and flooding this week ahead of the arrival of Storm Ciarán, which is set to bring strong winds and heavy rain when it arrives on Thursday.Parts of Britain faced further severe downpours at the weekend, hampering the recovery from the devastating floods that left at least seven people dead, hundreds homeless and scores of properties damaged.MPs and residents across England and Scotland have demanded a review of the protections in place in the aftermath of Storm Babet, which overwhelmed defences and caught forecasters off-guard.Steve Reed, Labour’s shadow environment secretary, said: “The Conservatives’ sticking-plaster approach to flooding has left communities devastated and cost the economy billions of pounds.”Extreme weather events are becoming more likely and frequent due to climate breakdown, and have caused food shortages and price increases.An analysis of Environment Agency data obtained by Unearthed, the investigative arm of Greenpeace UK, showed that 4,204 of England’s most important flood defences were in a poor or very poor condition in 2022. This accounts for about one in 15 of the total.Across the country, 856 were judged very poor, meaning they had “severe defects resulting in complete performance failure”, essentially rendering them useless.The remaining 3,348 were in poor condition, meaning they have defects that would “significantly reduce” their performance.In the 10 English counties worst affected by Storm Babet, spanning from Suffolk to Northumberland, 646 were in a poor condition and 135 were judged to be very poor.The Environment Agency, which owns and maintains more than half of the flood defences in England, said inspections from the latest financial year showed an improvement, from one in 15 being in disrepair to one in 20.It added that contingency plans will be put in place if required when critical defences are found to be in poor condition.Paul Morozzo, Greenpeace UK’s senior climate campaigner, said: “Our crumbling flood defences are a symbolic and literal demonstration of the government’s failure to tackle the climate crisis.“Storm Babet was a sobering reminder that the climate crisis is on our doorstep and that the cost – both in terms of lives lost and damage caused – is huge.“Without bold action to cut emissions as fast as possible, extreme storms and flooding will become more common and more intense. And without the necessary investment and upgrades, our flood defences will continue to fail.“By rowing back on its climate commitments and failing to ensure we have infrastructure needed to mitigate its impacts, the government has all but given up on the communities it is supposed to protect. This is a shameful dereliction of duty and will cost votes in the coming election unless Sunak wakes up and has the guts to change direction.”The Environment Agency, which is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, aimed last year to repair scores of its flood defences leaving only 30 in poor or very poor condition. In reality, 1,766 remained in that category.The environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, suggested last week that the Met Office and the Environment Agency had been caught off-guard by Storm Babet because the rain came in from the east.She also said it looked as if her department “may not be hitting” its target of protecting 336,000 properties by 2027.The Met Office has said the 18 to 20 October period was the third-wettest independent three-day period in England and Wales since 1891. The Midlands provisionally recorded its wettest three-day period on record.Defra said it was investing £5.2bn between 2021 and 2027 to protect properties from flooding and that more than 96,000 buildings were shielded from Storm Babet.An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “We maintain approximately 76,000 flood assets across England, 95% of which we would expect to function as designed during a flood, which is an increase on the previous year.“We prioritise maintenance where there is significant threat to lives and livelihoods, which was supported by a £200m investment between April 2022 and March 2023 to ensure our assets were winter ready.” This article’s headline was amended on 31 October 2023. A previous version used the phrase “almost useless” in quotation marks, though this description was not found in the Unheard analysis."

        "text": "Cattle-ranching, not cocaine, has driven the destruction of the Colombian Amazon over the last four decades, a new study has found.Successive recent governments have used environmental concerns to justify ramping up their war on the green shrub, but the research shows that in 2018 the amount of forest cleared to cultivate coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, was only 1/60th of that used for cattle.A third of companies linked to deforestation have no policy to end itRead moreThe study’s findings vindicate conservation experts who have long argued that Colombia’s strategy to conserve the Amazon – often centered on combating coca production – has been misplaced.“We want to finally eradicate this narrative that coca is the driver of deforestation,” said Paulo Murillo-Sandoval at the University of Tolima, who led the study.Deforestation spiked after the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) signed a landmark peace agreement with the government in 2016 and laid down their weapons.As the rebels came out of the jungle, land-grabbers took advantage, clearing trees with chainsaws and burning vast areas. Deforestation reached a record high of 219,973 hectares (543,565 acres) in 2017, up 23% from the previous year.Then president Iván Duque used the environmental destruction caused by coca cultivation to justify stepping up military action against coca farmers. Prohibited from spraying coca crops with glyphosate after the chemical was banned in 2015 for health concerns, the Duque government sent in choppers and armed troops into the Amazon rainforest, sometimes into deadly confrontations with coca farmers.Yet while cattle ranches cleared more than 3m hectares (7.4m acres) of Amazon rainforest in 2018, coca’s impact was negligible.Cattle roam the deforested Amazon in Guaviare, Colombia, in 2022. Photograph: Mauricio Dueñas Castañeda/EPAOnly 45,000 hectares (111,200 acres) were cleared for coca in 2018, the latest year available in the study.Using a deep learning algorithm to differentiate between land used for coca and cattle, Murillo and his colleagues were for the first time able to distinguish between the activities on a mass scale from 1985 to 2019.“We have always contested the government’s argument that coca was driving deforestation but lacked the evidence,” said Angelica Rojas, liaison officer for Guaviare state at the Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development, a Colombian environmental thinktank. “Now we have real data with which we can oppose this mistake.”The figures show that previous governments have used the environment as a false justification to wage war on coca farmers, said Rojas, who was not involved in the study.“They didn’t want to prevent deforestation, they just wanted to justify spending more money and resources on their real political goal: eliminating coca,” she said.The study also adds to evidence that despite lives being sacrificed and billions of dollars being spent, Colombia’s “war on drugs” has failed to halt coca production – and in some cases it may have even made it worse.When farmers have their crops eradicated they simply establish new plots, often just a few kilometres deeper into the forest canopy, Murillo said. “The war on drugs started 40 years ago now, yet everyone knows where coca is: in the same place they have always been.”As the government has engaged in a game of whack-a-mole with coca farmers, the real driver of deforestation, cattle farming, has been allowed to swallow up vast swathes of land, the authors argue.Flaws in Colombian land regulation have incentivised the conversion of biodiverse tropical rainforests into barren pastures.To get their deeds recognised, landowners must demonstrate that 75% of their plots are productive, and it is far easier for farmers to use cows than crops, said Carlos Devia, a forest engineer at Bogotá’s Javeriana University who was not involved in the study.“Ranching is the easiest way to show you’re using land, as it’s unregulated. You could have 100 hectares of land and just throw 10 cows in there, whereas for potatoes or corn only a hectare would require a year of great work,” Devia said.Landless farmers often clear a few hectares of rainforest and sell them illegally to members of criminal organisations who then join up multiple small lots, transforming them into vast swathes of lifeless, arid pasture.Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who took office in August last year, is proposing a U-turn on Colombia’s failed anti-narcotics strategy.Petro, a former member of the defunct M-19 rebel group, has turned the focus away from forced coca eradication, and is buying up millions of hectares of land to give to farmers.“Reducing drug use does not require wars, it needs us all to build a better society,” Petro told the UN general assembly in September last year."

        "text": "Exposure to several widely used insecticides probably decreases sperm concentration and may have profound effects on male fertility, new US research finds.The George Mason University paper analyzed five decades of peer-reviewed studies to determine if organophosphates and carbamate-based pesticides exposure correlated with decreased sperm concentration.Collectively, the studies researchers included looked at about 1,800 men, and showed what co-author Melissa Perry, dean of the George Mason College of Public Health, characterized as a “strong association”.“Based on this meta analysis, we believe insecticide exposure … is impacting overall sperm concentration,” she told the Guardian. “The message is we need to reduce insecticide exposure in order to ensure men who are planning a family or want to conceive children are able to do that without interference.”The findings come amid growing concern over global declines in sperm concentration and quality. Recent research estimated sperm concentration has plummeted by about 50% over the last 50 years, and Perry said the insecticides could represent a piece of that puzzle.About 15m pounds of organophosphates are spread on US cropland annually, and the chemical formula has been linked to cancer, while exposure during pregnancy is tied to neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD and autism. The insecticide is also commonly used on lawns or indoors.The Environmental Protection Agency announced this year it was accelerating new regulations for some types of organophosphates because they are much more toxic than previously thought. Carbamates are similarly utilized, and both are neurotoxins that work by damaging an enzyme that regulates an insect’s nerve signals sent throughout its body.“These are manufactured to kill things and are biologically active by their very nature,” Perry said, but that can have consequences for larger living organisms.The chemicals appear to interfere with the human endocrine system’s hormone production, she said, which would “have a direct impact on how much and how normally sperm is produced”. The chemicals may also damage testes cells and alter neurotransmission in the brain related to reproductive purposes.Agricultural workers face the highest exposure, but about one-third of the studies’ participants were exposed largely through food, or other environmental routes, Perry said. Though the strongest correlation was found among participants who face occupational exposure, that may only be because fewer studies looking at environmental exposure exist, she added.Public health advocates are increasingly pressuring the EPA to impose stricter regulations of the chemicals, or ban them outright. Perry said the best way individuals can protect themselves is to know which foods typically have high levels of pesticide residues on them.But, she added, it shouldn’t be “up to each individual person to solve this”.“The recommendation we’re making is to recognize that these insecticide exposure are a public health issue … and we really need to look toward policy solutions that recognize that a health threat exist,” Perry said."

        "text": "Increased sewage pollution, urban flooding and water supply interruptions are the result of a decade of failures by the Conservative ministers, according to water experts who are demanding an independent inquiry into water be set up by the next government.The repeated failure of the Tories to implement rules to create “sponge cities” has led to much more visible sewage pollution, more flooding and increasing instances of water being cut off for householders and businesses, they say.Alastair Chisholm, the director of the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management, said: “These rules should have come in in 2011. They were canned by Eric Pickles in 2015 and we have had 13 years of delays. This has been kicked down the road and what is going on now is the result of that.”How could England’s water system be fixed?Read moreHe spoke as the institute published a comprehensive report at Westminster, which calls for the next government to order an independent investigation into water companies, who stand accused of widespread pollution and profiteering, and the regulators, who have failed to robustly control the privatised industry.“Over 30 years on from water privatisation, with widespread urbanisation and agricultural intensification, a fresh approach – including potential reform of water regulators – is needed,” the report says.“With levels of trust in water companies impacted by repeated reports of pollution and profiteering, both public and water practitioners want more transparency and assurance that companies are acting in the interest of society and the environment.”The authors of the report interviewed professionals working in the water and environmental industries. Overwhelmingly, they expressed widespread dissatisfaction over water company ownership and operations. Just 6% of the experts questioned were supportive of a continuation of the current approach to ownership, corporate governance and regulation.The report calls for the Conservative government to finally implement rules to create sponge cities after a decade in which ministers have delayed and attempted to scrap the plans. Sponge cities are urban zones with multiple areas of greenery, trees, ponds, soakaways, pocket parks and permeable paving to allow water to drain away. They also include measures to store rainwater and runoff, such as widespread use of water butts.Increased runoff from rainfall overwhelms water company sewage systems, which have not been maintained and improved by water companies as a result of under-investment. The extra water increases the likelihood of raw sewage being discharged, while hard surfaces in towns and cities increase the risk of flooding.In its latest business plan, Thames Water says by 2015 London had seen the biggest decrease in plant cover in front gardens of anywhere in the UK, with five times as many front gardens with no plants compared with the preceding 10 years.This increased the burden on sewers and the risk of pollution, the company said.But the Conservative government has repeatedly failed to implement rules under schedule 3 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, which mandated developers to install sustainable drainage systems in new developments. Conservative ministers have argued the requirements will be too costly for developers.The Guardian revealed last year that at least 10% of donations received by the Conservative party since 2010 came from property developers, real estate tycoons and others connected with the construction industry.How much of your water bill is swallowed up by company debt? – interactiveRead morePublic outcry over sewage pollution, and revelations about water companies’ abuse of storm overflows to dump raw sewage into rivers, which should only take place in exceptional circumstances, have forced the government to look again at schedule 3. But as yet it has not been made mandatory for developers.“Sponge cities are not a new concept and are being delivered internationally to manage demands for growth amidst water – typically flood and drought – crises,” the report said.“In the UK we have our own water crises spanning these same challenges of either too much or too little water, as well as pollution.“Greening our urban spaces is a win-win approach on all these fronts. We must flip the mindset that treats rainwater as a waste product to be got rid of in the urban environment, into one where it is a treasured resource.”The report, which polled 4,000 members of the public, found 71% of people in England believed water company profits should be restricted because of performance concerns. Two-thirds said companies made too much profit."

It would have been a windfall season, were it not for the varroa mite.“Now both these areas are in red zones. The hives are set to be destroyed regardless of whether they have varroa mite or not,” Banham said.“That’s our entire business between those two sites. It’s taken 23 years of blood, sweat and tears to get to this point.“They’re like family to us, our bees. How can someone come back from this?”The varroa mite is a sesame-seed sized parasite that has wreaked havoc on the New South Wales honeybee industry since it was first detected in surveillance hives in the Port of Newcastle in June last year.In the past month the pest has been detected in hives at Euroley, ​​Nericon, and Balranald in the Riverina; Euston in Sunraysia; Newcastle and Singleton in the Hunter; Tamworth in New England; Blackwall on the Central Coast; Vineyard in the Sydney basin; and Cuttabri in NSW’s north-west.These hives had all been transported from areas around Kempsey, where they were fulfilling pollination contracts, before the infestation was discovered. All areas where the mite has been detected have been declared red zones.The detections at Balranald and Euston were close enough to the Victorian border that emergency zones were extended into that state last month. It is the first time an emergency zone has been declared outside NSW since the outbreak began.To date there have been no varroa mite detections in Victoria, the state’s chief plant health officer, Dr Rosa Crnov, said.Banham’s beekeeping shed is now located within a red zone. The emergency order, issued by the NSW government last week, means that bees are unable to be kept in any red zone – which now includes Kempsey – for the next three years.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nThe NSW and federal governments have announced an $18m reimbursement package for beekeepers affected by the outbreak, but Banham and other commercial keepers say that’s not enough.“The compensation, we feel, is on the minimal end of the scale to what it actually costs to rebuild a hive,” she says.“It’s wiped our entire business out. We don’t have anything to fall back on, and we now have no income and a mortgage to pay and two little kids, ongoing business expenses, and we have nothing left. It’s all gone.”More than 28,000 hives have been destroyed since the mite was first detected 14 months ago. As of this month there have been 250 properties listed as having an infestation. Eradication zones – red zones – now cover more than 1,683,000 hectares, or 2% of NSW’s landmass. All honeybees within red zones have to be euthanised, whether the varroa mite has been detected in their hive or not.Bees within emergency surveillance zones, marked in purple on a map updated daily by the NSW Department of Primary Industries, must not be moved unless they have an approved permit issued by the department.Benjamin Durie, a commercial beekeeper from the Humble Hive Collective in Maitland, lost his hives in the early stages of the varroa outbreak last year.“You get compensated for the hardware. You’re compensated for the bees. But you then lose any potential revenue from those sites,” he says.“So for me I lost a rose farm, I lost a vineyard and a brewery, where I would regularly run talks and classes.“It multiplies when you lose the platform. You’re not just losing the bees or the potential honey revenue, you’re also losing the opportunity to make more. And to beekeepers that’s really hard.” This article was amended on 3 October 2023. Due to a transcription error in an earlier version, the number of hives destroyed by the varroa mite was stated as “more than 280,000”, rather than 28,000.\nEmily Middleton is a journalist in central-west NSW\n"

        "text": "Low-traffic neighbourhoods seemingly can prompt residents to drive less, with a study showing people in one London borough cut their driving by nearly a mile a day on average after LTNs were introduced.While the research covers only four LTNs created in 2020, it is potentially significant because it contradicts the objection from opponents of the schemes that they make people drive further on less direct routes.It comes at a crucial time for the future of the schemes, with the Department for Transport under Mark Harper appearing unsympathetic towards them after negative coverage in some newspapers.Filters on smaller residential streets that allow bike and pedestrian access but prevent through-traffic by motor vehicles have been used in the UK for decades, but became controversial after a number were installed at the start of the Covid pandemic, branded as LTNs.Proponents say they make smaller roads quieter and more tempting for walking and cycling, and also make it less convenient to drive, thus prompting a shift in behaviour by some people for briefer trips. Opponents say they simply lengthen and displace motor vehicle journeys.The new study, published in the journal Transport Findings, used mileage data logged as part of MOT tests from thousands of vehicles in Lambeth, south London. It showed an average decline in driving of 0.7km (0.4 miles) a day for every vehicle inside LTNs, two years after they were installed, compared with a rise of 0.6km for streets 200 metres or more outside their boundaries, for a net 1.3km (0.8 miles) reduction, or 6.4%.The authors of the study, led by Dr Anna Goodman, an epidemiologist from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the increase in average driving outside the LTNs appeared to be due to Covid and other external factors, rather than people skirting the LTNs.People living the closest to the LTNs, within 200 metres of their edges, who would be expected to be most affected by such changes to driving trips, recorded an increase in their average driving levels, but by less than those further away.The study, also involving academics from the University of Westminster and Imperial College London, linked the mileage data logged in annual MOT tests – mandatory for all cars or vans three years old or more – with information about residents’ parking permits to estimate average distances driven each year per vehicle.This was initially calculated for 2018 to 2020, to take into account the position before the LTNs were installed, and then between 2021 and 2023. The data covered just over 8,500 cars and vans for the first period, and more than 10,000 for the second.Adding to the expectation that the net reduction in driving was caused by the LTNs is the fact that the data from 2018 to 2020 showed no difference in trends between the areas subsequently covered by the zones and those outside.Similarly, the decrease in mileage was seen in households with the same vehicle registered in 2020 and 2023, indicating the change was not caused by people who drive more frequently simply moving out but by a change in behaviour.The areas within and outside the LTNs had largely similar demographic and socioeconomic profiles, while the changes in driving were seen in more deprived and more affluent areas, the study found.The overall 1.3km-a-day reduction covers all journeys, including longer-distance ones, meaning the effect on reducing local car and van trips could be even greater.Goodman said: “To achieve an estimated 6% relative decrease in total annual driving is really impressive. Moreover, for shorter and more local trips it is plausible that the relative decrease in residents’ driving is even greater than 6%.“This matters because, while reducing driving of any type is good news in terms of carbon emissions, reducing driving within cities brings large additional health benefits in terms of air pollution, noise and road safety.”"

        "text": "Farmers in England are being left without crucial nature recovery payments and unsure of what to plant after delays to a post-Brexit scheme.The sustainable farming incentive (SFI) is part of a package of payments that is replacing the EU’s common agricultural policy, which paid land managers for the amount of land in their care. The aim of the SFI is to pay farmers to look after nature, soil and other public goods, rather than simply for farming and owning land.The 2023 scheme was supposed to roll out in August but is being delayed, and farmers are not expected to receive any payments until 2024. Because the rules regarding SFI payments have changed since last year, land managers are unsure whether to continue with the scheme from 2022, or to follow guidance laid out in proposals for the 2023 scheme.This is the latest blow to the post-Brexit scheme. Last year, only 224 farmers in England received payments under SFI. Just a tiny fraction of the payments went to farmers in 2022. While subsidies were cut by an average of 22% for farmers last year, the money paid out through SFI equated to only 0.44% of the total funding plan for farmers, leaving them asking where the money is going.This year the cuts are even more stark, with the government planning to slash payments by 36%. This, coupled with a difficult harvest caused by adverse weather conditions and rising interest rates, is causing a squeeze on farms.David Exwood, the vice-president of the National Farmers’ Union, said: “Farmers in England have had further basic payment scheme reductions. Milk prices are down and prices for red meat are also on the slide.“It has been the most expensive year we have ever had and a very difficult harvest. It will be a tough autumn for farmers.”The industry publication Farmers Weekly reported that the IT team managing the scheme had encountered technical problems, leading to further delays.Alice Groom, the head of sustainable land use policy at the conservation charity the RSPB, said: “With the proposed August rollout yet to begin we increasingly fear that Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] is at risk of failing on all fronts – leaving farmers confused and with no progress against pressing environmental targets. This is undermining everyone’s efforts to produce food while creating space for nature and taking action on climate.“The UK government needs to step up a gear and show leadership here with a clear roadmap – detailing how ambitious schemes, advice, grants and support will enable all farmers to have profitable, nature positive and low carbon businesses.”Martin Lines, the UK chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, told Farmers Weekly: “This continued uncertainty is leaving farmers with the inability to plan their sustainable farming businesses for the future, delivering public goods and food production hand in hand.“Defra seems to continue to overpromise and underdeliver, leaving farmers in the lurch and making it almost impossible to plan their future through this transition.”A Defra spokesperson said: “We are continuing preparations to open SFI 2023 for applications, including final pre-launch tests and adjustments to ensure the process is as straightforward as possible.” A spokesperson said applications will be open from 18 September."

Plant-based diets lower greenhouse gas emissions and require less land and water.The research at the University of Winchester calculated that if all the world’s dogs went vegan, it would free up a larger land mass than Mexico and more freshwater than all the renewable freshwater in Denmark, and would feed about 450 million additional people – more than the entire EU population.If all the world’s cats went vegan, it would save more emissions than those produced by New Zealand, land larger than Germany, freshwater exceeding all renewable freshwater in Jordan, and would feed about 70 million additional people – more than the entire UK population, according to the study published in the Plos One scientific journal.Prof Andrew Knight, the veterinary academic who led the study, said that many pet owners were unaware of the “profound environmental impacts” caused by their animals’ food.“Pet owners who care about the environment or their animals’ health should consider nutritionally sound vegan pet food,” he said.He noted that large scale studies had already shown that dogs and cats can be just as healthy, or even more, on a vegan diet, so long as they eat pet food that is specially formulated with additional vitamins, amino acids and minerals to ensure it is nutritionally sound.“Studies of feeding behaviour have demonstrated that average dogs and cats enjoy vegan pet foods as much as those made from meat,” he added.Cats may get health benefits from vegan diet, study suggestsRead moreUntil recently it was difficult for cats and dogs to follow a plant-based diet, however vegan pet food has developed in recent years, with the vegan dog food market valued at £11.5bn in 2023, and projected to reach £21bn by 2033.Knight’s calculations also demonstrated that if all the world’s people went vegan, it would save more greenhouse gases than all those emitted by the entire EU, land larger than Russia and India combined, renewable freshwater exceeding all that of Cuba, and would feed about 5.3 billion additional people – almost two-thirds of the world’s current population.The British Veterinary Association and Blue Cross have previously advised against feeding animals a vegan diet as it can be difficult to get the balance of nutrients right, leading to a risk of dietary deficiencies and associated disease. They recommend that anyone considering a vegan diet for their pet should consult their vet first."

Its presence in the suburban community east of Los Angeles is highly unusual, experts say, and has drawn regular crowds eager to catch a glimpse of the majestic creature featured in the Harry Potter series.“It’s a beautiful bird,” said Trude Hurd, the project director of Sea and Sage Audubon Society in Orange county. “It’s got beautiful talons and feathers on its feet that look like snow boots.”Snowy owls are normally found around the Arctic and Canada and migrate to several northern US states during winter, but are more typically seen in states such as Washington or Maine. They have been seen in Florida and Texas, but it’s “extremely rare” to encounter one so far south and west, an expert told the New York Times.A snowy owl perches on the top of a chimney of a home in Cypress, California. Photograph: Mark Rightmire/APThe large owl with its dense spotted plumage and piercing yellow eyes was believed to have first been spotted in November in San Pedro before making its way to Cypress where there are plenty of open fields the birds are used to hunting in. Since December the raptor has spent its evening hunting before returning to various rooftops in the palm tree-lined neighborhood where it perches for the day, sleeping and coughing up pellets, the undigested bones and feathers of its prey, Hurd said.“This particular individual is way south of where it should be in winter but it’s finding food, it’s regurgitating pellets … so far appears to be normal and doing normal snowy owl behavior,” she added.The bird is believed to be an adult female or young male.Bird enthusiasts, news vans and ornithologists have flocked to the neighborhood in the weeks since, with crowds of up to 60 people quietly lining up to view the bird on the roof between 6am and 4pm.Crowds of up to 60 people quietly lined up to see the bird. Photograph: MediaNews Group/Los Angeles Daily News/Getty Images“It’s a beautiful thing to see,” Vic Leipzig, a birding instructor at Saddleback College, told the Orange County Register last month. “That there were so many people standing there watching this thing was very thrilling to me. And not just people, as I expected, who had traveled long distances, but folks from the neighborhood as well.”Hurd has seen the owl twice. On her most recent visit, it was so quiet “you could hear a pin drop”, she said, a sign people were being respectful of the bird as visitors are advised to use quiet voices, keep 100ft of distance and avoid flash photography so as to not disturb the owl.“There’s no chance I would ever see a snowy owl. Being able to see a snowy owl literally in our backyard … It’s a bird I never expected to see in my lifetime and here it is right in front of me,” she said. “I did a little happy dance.”These birds typically migrate north in March or April, which means visitors could have a few more months to view the arctic creature."

Likewise, if the seismograph data shows dramatic oscillations, so too will the melody.Vicinanza will use a computer program he has developed to turn real-time data, recorded by a seismograph the US Geological Survey at Yellowstone national park, into a musical score.

But he stressed the human performer remained crucial, with Schwartz bringing her own interpretation of the score to the piece and using the notes to tell a story.“She will be able to highlight what she will think at that moment is the most relevant thing,” he said.Vicianza said he hoped the performance might also give listeners good vibrations about science.“[Science] is something that everybody can enjoy,” he said."

It was agreed there would be follow-up discussions between staff, suggesting there is a live conversation about how the expansion of the ultra-low emissions zone (Ulez) will work in practice.Khan has sought to signal he is in listening mode and it is understood from those close to city hall that he is happy to look at any new ideas for ways to mitigate the impact on Londoners.However, the London mayor will not compromise on any moves that could reduce the effectiveness of the policy, which is designed to tackle air pollution and climate change.Khan last month widened the pool of people who can get financial support to replace polluting vehicles, ahead of Ulez being expanded from its current boundaries of the north and south circular to the whole of Greater London.City hall sources did not rule out further such moves, given the Tories managed to successfully turn this week’s byelection in west London into a referendum on the Ulez extension.However, they were keen to stress that nine out of 10 cars in outer London are unaffected and will not have to pay the extra £12.50 a day surcharge.Starmer nodded to Ulez having been an issue at the byelection on Thursday. The result meant the Conservatives escaped a triple trouncing as Labour won in Selby and Ainsty and the Liberal Democrats took Somerton and Frome.Starmer told delegates at Labour’s policy forum: “That result in Uxbridge demonstrates there is never any reason to be complacent and never a reason to rest on our laurels.”Quoting the party’s candidate in Uxbridge, Danny Beales, he added: “It is a reminder, as Danny said, that in an election, policy matters.“And we are doing something very wrong if policies put forward by the Labour party end up on each and every Tory leaflet. We’ve got to face up to that and learn the lessons.”The future of the Ulez expansion faces greater uncertainty given it is subject to a judicial review, the outcome of which is expected to be known before the end of July.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have set a series of targets, very ambitious targets to get to 2050.“But what I think Uxbridge shows is that we have to do this in a careful manner, a manner over the course of several decades – and we have to take people with us.“And that is something that the Labour party failed to do in making their case in Uxbridge, and what the government wants to be very careful about doing is making sure that people come with us on this journey.”"

In the latest two swathes of announcements, policies dumped or delayed included a biofuel mandate, a “cash for clunkers” scheme that allowed people to trade in old, high-emissions vehicles for cleaner alternatives, the expansion of many regional public transport networks, and light rail plans for Auckland. Simultaneously, the government has extended tax cuts on petrol – subsidising fossil fuel consumption to keep petrol prices low. For Labour’s coalition partners, the Greens, the re-orientation is a source of strain and frustration, as the party struggles to achieve the level of climate action it desires as a coalition partner.“Five years on, we still don’t have an agricultural emissions pricing proposal worthy of the paper it’s written on – that even some of the industry players who came up with it are threatening to walk away from,” Shaw says. “That does my head in.”While none of the cut policies alone were expected to make an enormous dent in New Zealand’s emissions profile – Hipkins has called them “a very, very small contribution to our overall emissions reduction targets” – their collective scrapping contributed a picture of a government closing down some of its low emissions pathways to focus its energies on paving a highway to re-election. “There have been a number of moves, like the extension of the fossil fuel subsidy, and those other moves earlier this week, that do add up to a situation where we don’t have very many easy options left,” Shaw says, speaking to the Guardian after his speech on Sunday. “We are going to have to bring something new to the table that brings down emissions by more than the sum total of the policies that were cut.”So far, he says, he has had no substantive discussions with the government about what those replacement policies would be.“It is a new administration, essentially,” he says, comparing Hipkins’ government with Ardern’s, but says the relationship is still strong.New Zealand minister decries climate crisis ‘lost decades’ in wake of Cyclone GabrielleRead more“There’s a lot that we agree on. But there are also things where we disagree, or we would prioritise things differently. And so you would expect a bit of friction around those things. That’s not unusual.”With the election less than seven months away, the Green party is tasked with a difficult juggling act: persuading voters that it can make substantive, transformative changes in government, while harnessing and channelling growing frustration at New Zealand’s glacial climate progress. After years of cheerleading government reforms, Shaw has swung more firmly toward the latter.“We have done a pretty good job of the governments that we’ve been given. But with only two ministers, both outside cabinet, we don’t always get what we want.”Going into the October election, Shaw has promised that the Greens “will not accept anything less than the strongest possible climate action” – but what that non-acceptance would look like in practice is less clear. In the coming election, Labour will require the Green party’s support to form a government. While this should place the party in a strong position to bargain for policy gains, the Greens have effectively ruled out working with the opposition. “If they want to form a government with us after the election, then what we’re proposing will be very strong action on climate change.”If Labour enters coalition negotiations with a milquetoast set of climate policies, says co-leader Marama Davidson, “they can’t take our support for granted”."

        "text": "While flood waters look to have peaked in South Australia, authorities are concerned about the potential for a blackwater event that may lead to fish kills along the River Murray.Flows at the border into South Australia had not increased for the last seven consecutive days with authorities confident peak flows had reached South Australia and would work their way downriver.But as the extent of the flooding was known, there were growing concerns a blackwater event may follow leading to fish kills as waters recede.The ‘silent killer’ of flooding: Murray River fish in dire straits as water quality dropsRead moreBlackwater events are caused when heavy rains wash leaf litter that has collected on a flood plain into a major river such as the Barwon-Darling, turning it the colour of dark tea.As this leaf litter breaks down and bacteria decomposes, the organic compounds dissolve. They consume oxygen and dissolve carbon dioxide into the water, making it difficult for fish to breathe. They can also be made more severe by warm weather.Craig Copeland, the CEO of OzFish, said in New South Wales there had been a delay between flooding and blackwater events that led to fish kills.\nSign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads\n“There is still a risk of a fish kill occurring,” Copeland said. “The government in South Australia are aware that that may be the case, as are many recreational fishers who are aware of what’s been happening in NSW and Victoria.”“Every part of the river system is different, so I don’t exactly know how it might transpire down there, but so far it hasn’t and we can only keep our fingers crossed that it doesn’t.”Though there were potential environmental benefits from massive flows into parts of the river that have not flooded in decades, Copeland said there were also risks to people and wildlife as “everything that’s on a flood plain ends up in the water”.“If there’s pesticides on the flood plain, there’s pesticides in the water. If there’s plastics on the flood plain, it’s in the water,” he said.In November, when Victoria’s Environmental Protection Authority tested flood waters in the state it found E coli and chemicals such as PFAS and pesticides, residents were warned not to swim in the water.SA Health’s principal water quality adviser, Dr David Cunliffe, said “there is no evidence of increased E coli” but people were advised not to enter flood waters.“While there is no evidence of increased E coli in flood waters in the Riverland, we advise people to not drink flood water or tank water which may have been contaminated,” Cunliffe said. “All recreational boating and water activities are banned on the river, including swimming, bathing and diving.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Five Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Pirsa will lead coordination of clean-up operations and the disposal of fish carcasses,” they said.“Fish kill clean-up operations will be assessed on a case-by-case basis and will aim to reduce the risk of adverse socio-economic, human health and environmental impacts.”Further up river, the Mildura councillor Jason Modica, who chairs Region 4 of the Murray Darling Association, said conditions were beginning to ease but residents had noticed issues.“The water’s been dark for quite sometime,” he said. “There’s been some people that have seen small spots of dead fish but nothing like the fish kills that have been seen in Menindee three years ago.”He said any such event would be concerning as native fish populations had declined to “about 10%” of what they were at the time of European colonisation."

        "text": "Under-fire Southern Water and Thames Water have been named the “standout poor performers” in handling complaints from customers over the past year by a water watchdog.The Consumer Council for Water (CCW) found that customers of the two water companies, which together supply water and provide wastewater services to more than 20 million people in England, are “being let down by a failure to understand and deal with the causes of high levels of complaints from their customers”.CCW found that the overall performance of the industry was “skewed” by the large number of complaints made by households to the two firms.Complaints received by Southern Water were almost three times higher than the overall average for waste and sewerage companies, while those received by Thames Water were just over one-and-a-half times higher.Southern Water – which serves customers across Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight – was the most-complained about company over the past year, according to the CCW’s report.Last month, the regulator, Ofwat, ordered Thames Water to return £101m to customers, and Southern Water to hand back £43m, after underperforming on targets on leakage and sewage spills amid anger among politicians and the public over the actions of the water industry. Overall, water companies were ordered to return a balance of £114m to customers.CCW said in its report it had so far been “unimpressed by Southern Water’s apparent lack of understanding of what drives customers to complain” as well as its ability to address the root causes of complaints.Meanwhile, Thames Water – which has 15 million customers across London and the Thames Valley – was the only water and sewerage to be rated “poor” for both levels and handling of complaints.It was also the worst-performing water supplier for billing disputes and the number of complaints that could not be resolved the first time that a customer asked.The chief executive of the CCW, Mike Keil, said: “Trust in the water sector has never been more fragile and the task of rebuilding it is made all the more challenging when companies perform as poorly as Thames Water and Southern Water.”Keil said CCW was concerned that Thames Water was “compounding customers’ frustrations with delays and a failure to resolve many issues first time”.Nearly 233,000 complaints were made by households to water companies in England and Wales between April 2022 and the end of March this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said the company had reduced its “total household complaints by 28% compared to last year alongside a large reduction in telephone complaints”.Southern Water’s chief customer officer, Katy Taylor, said the company was “investing in video diagnostics, upskilling our customer service agents and keeping our customers regularly informed when issues take longer to fix”.Earlier this week, water companies submitted five-year business plans to Ofwat asking customers to pay for a record £96bn investment to fix raw sewage leaks.

        "text": "Scientists have identified more than 3,000 potentially harmful chemicals that can be found in food packaging and other food-related materials, two-thirds of which were not previously known to be in contact with food.An international group of scientists analyzed more than 1,200 scientific studies where chemicals had been measured in food packaging, processing equipment, tableware and reusable food containers.A report released on Thursday by the Food Packaging Forum, a Switzerland-based non-profit, noted little is known about many of the 3,240 chemicals examined in these studies or their effects on people.Manufacturers are either intentionally or unintentionally adding these chemicals to packaging and other equipment, said Pete Myers, a report co-author and founder and chief scientist of Environmental Health Sciences, a non-profit advocacy group. Either way, many of those chemicals are ending up in the human body, he said.“If we don’t know what it is, we don’t know its toxicity,” Myers said. “The mix of chemicals is just too complicated to allow us to regulate them safely.”The new analysis, published in the journal Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, comes amid growing concerns about exposure to potentially toxic chemicals in food and water.The Food Packaging Forum has created a searchable database with the chemicals found in the packaging and equipment, known as food contact materials. While many of the chemicals on the list are known hazards such as phthalates and PFAS, others have not been adequately studied, the group said, and their health effects are unclear.Researchers were shocked to find chemicals in food contact materials that consumers could have no knowledge of. Just one-third of the chemicals studied appeared in a previously compiled database of more than 12,000 chemicals associated with the manufacturing of food contact materials.Previous studies have found potentially dangerous PFAS “forever chemicals” in food packaging. Those chemicals have been linked to a list of health problems.Nearly two-thirds of the studies analyzed in the new report looked at chemicals in plastic. Packaging manufacturers often add chemicals without knowing the long-term ramifications, said Jessica Heiges, a UC Berkeley doctoral candidate who studies disposable food items such as plasticware and packaging and was not involved in the report.The chemicals “are terrifying because we don’t know what their impacts are”, Heiges said. “What’s most alarming is this cocktail of chemicals, how they’re interacting with each other. Some of them are persisting in the environment and in our bodies as we’re consuming them.”It’s likely many of those unknown chemicals are harmful, said Alastair Iles, an associate professor in UC Berkeley’s environmental science, policy and management department, also not involved with the study.“The report only underlines our gross ignorance when it comes to the chemicals that people are being exposed to every day,” he said. “If we didn’t know that there were so many chemicals in packages, what does that say about our knowledge about chemical risks?”"

        "text": "One of the biggest challenges in weaning off fossil fuels – and one that is often forgotten – is aviation. But for Pacific Island countries that poses a major conundrum. Right now, it would be effectively impossible to get to the Pacific islands without burning kerosene.Aviation connects families across the region and allows for essential travel, including for health and education. Flights also form the backbone of the growing and vital tourism industry. Tourism is now the biggest economic sector in the Pacific and it can bring many development benefits.As highly vulnerable island states, the goal of ridding the region of fossil fuels is an important one. The need to urgently transition away from fossil fuels is now also firmly embedded in the global climate framework through this week’s agreement made at Cop28 in Dubai. In March, Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Tonga, Fiji, Niue, and Solomon Islands – negotiated the “Port Vila Call for a Just Transition to a Fossil Fuel Free Pacific”. The topic was back on the agenda at the Pacific Island Forum in the Cook Islands in November. But the realities – and the critical role of tourism in the region – make this task more complex.‘First line of defence’: mangroves – and mitigation - lost in Fiji’s tourism developmentRead moreBefore the Covid-19 pandemic, there were 1.8 million international arrivals by air and cruise ship to Pacific Island countries. Energy use and emissions associated with international flights and shipping are not formally accounted for, but they are likely to be huge. A great first step would be to actually measure them, and document the size of the challenge.The border closures during the pandemic created space for critical voices regarding how much, and what types of tourism would be suitable to the island context, its unique cultures and sensitive ecologies. Fiji is seeking to diversify from the mass-tourism model that involves international hotel chains to a more homegrown model of small-scale eco and cultural tourism experiences. Other countries have found their existing, smaller operator tourism base under pressure from greater arrivals – seen in Vanuatu with the flow of large cruise ships. The Cook Islands are attempting to follow a regenerative model, where tourism leaves net benefits for the islands.There are some signs that the tourism industry that serves the Pacific can become more sustainable. For very short trips, for example travel from Rarotonga to Aitutaki (roughly 260km), or perhaps Samoa to Tokelau (about 550km), electric aircraft will become an option. Local airlines could offer services of perhaps even up to 1,000km. A completely different, regional network might even be superior to what is on offer now. This, of course, will only work if there is enough renewable electricity available; air travel remains incredibly energy intensive.That highlights the most urgent task – to scale up renewable electricity generation in the islands. All Pacific Island countries have a long way to become self-sufficient on renewable energy. Even Fiji, the country with the highest share of renewable energy, only reaches a level of 30% of total energy. At the same time, it would be beneficial to engage proactively with the possibilities and partners required to transition the regional aviation network. For example, there might be an opportunity where start-up companies could test new technologies in the Islands, perhaps on short routes. This is happening in Alaska – where ZeroAvia and Alaska Airlines have teamed up to deliver a hydrogen-electric flight in 2024 to connect Anchorage and Kenai.Short hops and economy class: five expert tips on how to reduce your emissions on holidayRead moreFinally, discussions on how to increase tourism value without large volumes of visitors should be given more oxygen. Research to identify what types of tourists leave more benefit behind than others could inform nuanced marketing strategies. Benefits could come in the form of financial return, but they might also be measured as the contribution to conservation or the community, or indeed a lower-than-average carbon footprint.Clearing the Pacific Islands of fossil fuels is an admirable goal – and the whole world must follow suit should we want to make any progress on keeping global warming well below two degrees. However, the current investments into growing tourism will make it harder to achieve the vision. The long-term future of the region depends on effective climate action, and how to achieve tourism growth sustainably needs to be part of that conversation.\nDr Susanne Becken is a professor of sustainable tourism at Griffith University, Australia.\n"

        "text": "Driving an electric car on a single charge from London to Milan sounds like an impossible dream. Yet Japanese carmaker Toyota claims that by 2027 motorists will be able to buy such a vehicle. Running the air conditioner at full blast might reduce such an impressive range, but Toyota says drivers will be able to recharge in 10 minutes before they are back on the road. If this all sounds too good to be true, that’s because it probably is.What Toyota says it has found is nothing less than the holy grail of battery technology – the so-called solid state solution – which has long eluded the industry. Instead of a liquid core, the new battery has a solid one between electrodes. This means it is smaller and can store more energy – delivering a bigger range for the same weight. The heavy flammable liquid cores can also overheat and explode. Since 2017, UK emergency services have attended hundreds of electric vehicle fires.Rapid technological advances have historically been the norm in capitalism. Rich-world governments have rightly come to see electric cars as an essential way to reduce air pollution and crack down on climate-warming emissions, while satisfying an individual’s desire for personal transportation. Compared with combustion-engine cars, they have significant environmental benefits. But the climate crisis should be a chance to question whether the motorcar itself has become too embedded in our everyday lives. The future of “mobility” must involve much more than private cars.It would be churlish not to recognise that the Japanese carmaker’s announcement is a form of progress. There should be a sensible place for cars as part of an integrated transport plan in the years to come. As Toyota has been a sceptical voice about electric vehicles, a change of heart, if sincere, is to be welcomed. The company had previously staked its future on its range of hybrid-engine cars, powered by both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, arguing that shortages of key battery materials and insufficient charging infrastructure would prevent a universal switch to electric vehicles in the short term. Whether Toyota will be able to leapfrog its rivals remains to be seen, however, as mass production requires a far more stringent level of quality control and reliability.But even a low-carbon-emitting car remains a low-capacity mode of transportation. Doubling down on its near-monopoly over the surface transportation system would lead to a future of ever-worsening congestion and road accidents, which currently cost 30 lives in the UK every week. Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla, allegedly tried to kill the California high-speed rail project in 2013. A decade later the electric bullet train has announced it will be solar-powered. Industry lobbying in the 1930s helped pave the way for a US lifestyle dependent on cars and oil. That must not be replicated for electric vehicles today.The global north cannot just bet on a Toyota- or Tesla-style decarbonisation. The volume of critical minerals needed for decarbonising the rich world on its current growth path would leave nothing for poorer nations. Sunsetting undesirable technologies and infrastructures (such as carbon-intensive motoring) must be accompanied by a recognition that we all have to live within the world’s material constraints. In the richer world that must mean prioritising mass transportation and rethinking urban planning, not vesting so much hope in our current pattern of living continuing unchanged."

But although city life may have made them bolder than their country cousins, they are no more cunning – and most are likely to be too lazy to persevere at a problem to obtain food, research suggests.Globally, red foxes are among the most successful carnivores, and the number living in British towns and cities has exploded in recent years. But while some researchers have suggested that urbanisation might be making foxes and other wildlife bolder and smarter, few studies have directly tested how they compare with rural foxes when confronted with the same challenges.To investigate their boldness and willingness to solve problems, Dr Blake Morton at the University of Hull and his colleagues presented wild and urban foxes with puzzle feeders – simple contraptions that required them to lift, pull or rotate a lid or lever to access food – at 104 locations across England and Scotland, including parks, gardens, woodland, meadows and farmland.Morton said: “These were all devices that we had tested with foxes, so we knew they were able to solve these puzzles – but we wanted to know whether or not they were willing to do it.”The study, published in Animal Behaviour, found that foxes at most locations acknowledged the puzzles, but only those at 31 locations touched them, while foxes in just 12 locations gained access to the food.Although urban foxes were more likely to physically interact with the puzzle feeders, suggesting they might be bolder, there was no difference in their willingness to persist to try to gain access to the food inside.“Although we found a tendency for London foxes to behave bolder and exploit the puzzles, many other foxes in our study were too shy or unmotivated to exploit them despite having access for up to two weeks,” Morton said.“Just because you’re a city fox doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be a bold fox, and just because you’re a bold fox doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going to raid bins. I think that’s a really important reminder that animals, just like people, are very nuanced in their behaviour.”When they left the same food out for them to access freely, all of the foxes ate it. “Our conclusion is that they do like the food, but they don’t like the effort,” said Morton.He hopes the study will challenge the common stereotype of urban foxes as bin-raiding menaces. Although this sometimes happens, “we don’t think that most foxes are willing to raid bins – and if they do, there’s probably something else going on that drives them to do it”, he said.“Based on our study, we think that sources of food that are very low risk, and very easy to get access to – so things that don’t have lids or don’t have any physical barriers – are what a fox might love.”"

The change of heart puts it on a growing list of at least 20 countries, including Brazil, France, Germany, Sweden and Canada, calling for a pause on supporting exploration licences, at least until the environmental effects of seabed exploitation are better understood. Even car manufacturers such as BMW and Volvo, and the car battery maker Samsung, have pledged not to use deep-sea minerals in vehicles.On Monday, the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, said a UK-based environmental science network on deep-sea mining would be launched, to gather data and help fill in gaps in evidence on the environmental impact of mining. It would use its scientific expertise to “fully understand the impact of deep-sea mining on precious ecosystems, and in the meantime we will not support or sponsor any exploitation licences”, Coffey said.What’s at stake if we mine the deep sea? – podcastRead moreIn July, the Labour party urged the government to back the proliferating calls for a precautionary pause on deep-sea mining “unless and until” there was clear scientific evidence that it could be done safely and with new regulations to protect the marine environment.Monday marks the beginning of fresh negotiations at the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a quasi-UN body charged with regulating the industry in international waters. It met in July but no decision was reached on whether to allow production to go ahead. Member states agreed, however, to discuss a moratorium.The UK government holds two exploration licences to extract metals from the floor of the Pacific Ocean. It is among 14 countries sponsoring exploration or research contracts – the only type allowed so far – by companies intent on mining the deep sea. The others are China, Russia, South Korea, India, France, Poland, Brazil, Japan, Jamaica, Belgium, Nauru, Tonga and Kiribati.Mining companies say that harvesting minerals, including copper, nickel and cobalt, from the ocean instead of land is cheaper and less environmentally damaging.Scientists and environmental groups counter that less than 1% of the world’s deep seas have been explored, and warn that deep-sea mining could unleash noise, light and suffocating dust storms. In June, the European Academies Science Advisory Council warned of “dire consequences” for marine ecosystems should deep-sea mining go ahead. Scientists have also expressed concerns about spills of fuels and about other chemicals used in the mining process.“Deep-sea mining poses an existential threat to some of the most vulnerable, least explored habitats on the planet,” said Clare Brooke, chief executive of the conservation organisation Blue Marine Foundation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

These champion countries now need to turn these political declarations into a legal reality at the International Seabed Authority.”Fiona Nicholls, Greenpeace’s UK ocean campaigner, said: “The UK government’s change of heart on deep-sea mining shows the tide is turning against this destructive industry, threatening some of the world’s last undisturbed habitats.”"

        "text": "Years of breathing traffic pollution increases death rates in neighbourhoods, towns and cities, according to an international evidence review.The information came from many sources including a study on more than 100,000 female teachers and school administrators in California, a 40-year analysis of nearly 400,000 people in the UK census, and more than 800,000 English general practitioner records, along with analysis of the whole populations of Rome and Barcelona and studies on elderly people in Denmark and Japan.Having assimilated this evidence, the review led by the US Health Effects Institute (HEI) concluded,with high confidence, that strong connections existed between traffic and road air pollution and increased death rates. A wider HEI review in 2022 reached similar conclusions for connections with lung cancer and cases of new asthma in children and adults.The latest review scrutinised nearly 200 research studies that looked at air pollution and death rates including those from heart disease, stroke, respiratory problems and lung cancer. Specifically the review looked at the link with air pollution from traffic, adding to last year’s World Health Organization assessment.We often see estimates for early deaths from breathing polluted air. For the UK this is equivalent to between 29,000 and 43,000 deaths for adults, aged 30 and over, in 2019. For London the latest annual figure is between 3,600 and 4,100 attributable deaths. The new review will add to the evidence that feeds into these assessments and will improve estimates for the changes from policies, such as low emission zones.Looking to the future, even with electrification, traffic will still produce particle pollution from the wear of tyres, roads, and to a lesser extent brakes. The review panel found that few studies had addressed this.Dr Hanna Boogaard, who led the review, said: “Air quality regulations and improvements in vehicular emission-control technologies have contributed to decreases, however, those improvements do not fully offset the growth and increased congestion of the world’s motor vehicles.“To date, almost all traffic pollution regulations are targeting tailpipe emissions. Vehicles also pollute by resuspending road dust, abrading road surfaces, and wearing brakes and tyres, which leads to emissions of metals such as iron and copper.”Prof Barbara Hoffmann of the University of Düsseldorf, one of the authors of the review, said: “The evidence is very clear: road traffic does not only kill via accidents but also via the air pollution vehicles emit.”This week, a report from Imperial College London has highlighted that air pollution damages people’s health from before birth and into old age. Evidence in the report shows current levels of air pollution will be affecting everyone in London, including those living in the least polluted suburbs, and especially those with pre-existing vulnerabilities."

Internal combustion engines still dominate light vehicle sales in all other categories.Power vacuum: how a lack of charging stations is holding back Australia’s EV revolutionRead moreIn all categories 17,396 battery electric vehicles were sold in the first quarter, for the first time overtaking sales of conventional petrol hybrids, which numbered 16,101.Sales of battery electric vehicles were up 49.4% on the previous quarter, with 11,639 sold from October to December.The association’s managing director, Michael Bradley, said “the shift is on”.“We encourage political parties to work together to put all Australians in the best possible position to adopt low- and zero-emissions technologies that best suit their lifestyles, household budgets and consumer needs,” Bradley said in a statement.“We need collaborative national leadership to manage our environmental challenges, maintain consumer choice, and ensure we can sustainably pay for safer and less congested roads.’’The Greens and independent senator David Pocock have urged Labor to speed up EV uptake, with the Greens leader, Adam Bandt, criticising the lack of targets in the government’s policy, released on Wednesday.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nWithin the Coalition there is debate about whether to support Labor’s plan so that the government does not need the Senate crossbench to pass climate legislation, as it did for the emissions target and safeguard mechanism bills.On Thursday the shadow climate change minister, Ted O’Brien, said the opposition supported “next-generation clean technologies including EVs”.“The Coalition will take the time to study the government’s EV strategy,” he said in a statement. “As always, we will be constructive where we can and critical where we must.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "A man is under investigation by New South Wales state officials after he was allegedly caught illegally spearfishing three blue groper in an incident that has prompted calls for tougher penalties.The man had been interviewed and was being assessed for prosecution by senior fisheries compliance officials after he allegedly killed two female groper and one male groper on Plantation Point near Jervis Bay on the south coast on 5 January.Blue gropers are a protected fish species that can only legally be caught by line in NSW, where spearing them is an offence that carries a maximum penalty of a $22,000 fine or six-month jail term.It is unusual for fishing offences to proceed to court. Taking into account all fish species, 1,459 people were fined for unlawfully fishing in NSW in the past 12 months. Sixty of these people had been spearfishing.Over the past three years, only 204 fishers who broke the rules were taken to court. Eight of these people had been spearfishing.Blue groper: man fined $800 for killing protected fish in SydneyRead moreThe Plantation Point incident occurred less than a week after another man was caught spearing a large male blue groper at Oak Park in Cronulla, in Sydney’s south, on 30 December.The 26-year-old was fined $800 in total by the police and the government after the incident, which was highly publicised amid speculation the fish may have been the well-known “Gus the Groper”.Guardian Australia has confirmed both incidents were reported to NSW police but the force declined to comment further apart from saying it referred the matters to NSW Fisheries, the government agency in charge of compliance with fishing rules.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nLara Boag, a local dive operator who runs Woebegone Freedive around Jervis Bay, said she was “completely devastated” and “shocked” that the two incidents had occurred so close together.“[Blue gropers are] so inquisitive. That’s why we call them the labradors of the sea. For people, especially beginner snorkellers, they’re going to remember them for ever,” she said.Boag said she witnessed the man who allegedly killed the three groper on 5 January being spoken to by NSW Fisheries officers, who said they were acting on a tipoff from the public.She photographed the dead fish and shared the images on social media. She said a “fair penalty” for the alleged offence would be $10,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Years of hot dry summers parching lawns and killing off prize blooms have caused many gardeners to switch to using gravel and Mediterranean herbs, trees and shrubs.But a newly fashionable style of planting known as prairie planting could be a way to maintain a lush garden that is good for wildlife, while withstanding drought and floods.Perhaps cementing the style’s popularity, at Hampton Court flower show the winning garden demonstrated prairie planting found in the US.The garden, which won best in show on Monday, featured desert, forest and prairie landscapes often found across the Atlantic.While the cacti in the desert garden may feel inspirational for those whose plants were killed in the drought last year, the lush, colourful prairie planting is a more realistic alternative to traditional British gardening.Emily Grayshaw, who designed the winning garden America’s Wild, said: “Prairie planting is massive in the UK at the moment. It’s come over from the States and it’s been a theme that’s been building over the last few years so it was really good fun to play with it here.”While the brightly coloured flowers peeking out from long green grasses looks like a wildflower meadow, it is not.“Wildflower planting is a little bit different. It is almost things that self-seed and travel. Prairie planting is a little bit more purposeful, so it’s things that can cope with a prairie landscape. You’re talking probably about 30% grasses intermingled with species of summer flowers,” she said.Brightly coloured flowers peek out from long green grasses. Photograph: Maureen McLean/ShutterstockGrayshaw used flowers including the purple coneflower, blazing star and prairie onion intermingled with switchgrass and prairie sage to create a meadow, which swayed in the summer breeze and was full of pollinators.“These plants are really good for being drought-tolerant once you get them established,” Grayshaw said. “Plant them out and water them for a year and then you can wean them off being watered. They are great for the changing climate in the UK as they can deal with drought and sustained rainfall.”Grayshaw said she preferred this type of planting to a more Mediterranean style suited to a very arid climate. “It is tempting after a drought to go for a Mediterranean approach. But I think North American planting is much more transferable to the UK than Mediterranean. I love Mediterranean planting but it’s all about gravel and drainage and keeping it dry when England does get wet. It’s about having amazing drainage, if not, your lavender’s just going to go soggy because it’s not meant to be there at that time.”She said it was much easier to grow this style of planting because you just plant it and go, and that she was working with schools to create low-maintenance prairie meadows. “I’m dealing with a school at the moment. I’m just going to plant the whole thing out with grasses because that means the caretaker who is on a limited budget can just go into January, cut down the whole lot. Then it all comes back for the next year and keeps going all the way through the year.”"

        "text": "Six years ago the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott argued global warming may benefit populations, noting that more people died from cold weather than heatwaves.The speech in London, to climate-sceptic thinktank the Global Warming Policy Foundation, is now under renewed scrutiny after it was announced on Friday that he had been nominated to join the board of the Fox Corporation, part of the Murdoch family’s global media empire.Lachlan Murdoch announced the proposed new appointment in one of his first actions since he took over the running of the family business, following the decision by Rupert Murdoch to go into semi-retirement. The proposed board appointment faced criticism this weekend as an indication of the political complexion of the business under its new boss.Chris Wallace, professor of political history at the University of Canberra, said the decision “shows Lachlan doubling down on News [Corp’s] rightwing crusading when the costly lessons of recent and ongoing litigation suggest that’s not smart”.The Australian Greens communications and media spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said it was a “shockingly bad decision” and proved the need for a royal commission into the Murdoch empire. “Putting Tony Abbott on the Fox board is a brazen attack on global efforts to tackle climate change,” she said.Abbott said in 2009 that the “so-called settled science of climate change” was “absolute crap”. He joined the board of the Global Warming Policy Foundation earlier this year. The Fox press release announced his proposed appointment along with former Microsoft executive Peggy Johnson. Lachlan Murdoch, executive chair and chief executive of Fox Corporation, said: “They bring skills, experience and perspectives that will contribute to the board and benefit Fox.”Tony Abbott  said in 2009 that the ‘so-called settled science of climate change’ was ‘absolute crap’. Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAPThe nomination will be considered by shareholders at the media giant’s annual meeting later this year.The announcement last Thursday of Rupert Murdoch stepping down from Fox Corporation and News Corp has fuelled speculation over the direction of the media empire under its new regime. While some reports have claimed Lachlan Murdoch is more rightwing than his father, Paul Verna, an analyst at Insider Intelligence, told the Los Angeles Times: “There’s not a lot of daylight between the two men.”Lachlan was born in London, but raised in New York. He graduated with a degree in philosophy from Princeton University, where he wrote a 55-page thesis on a “study of freedom and morality” in the practical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, the German philosopher.He joined the family business on graduating, holding a series of roles in Australia and the US, including short stints on the Times and the Sun, according to The Successor, a biography by Paddy Manning.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

That includes wrapping around multipack tins and greetings cards, lids from products including wipes, yoghurts and creams, and plastic bags from its grocery deliveries.However, part of that pressure has come from government-mandated changes, including rules that came into force in 2020 to restrict the supply of single-use plastic straws, drink stirrers and cotton buds, and a tax introduced in 2022 on plastic packaging that was not at least 30% recycled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Bowen will highlight national and regional security risks in his annual climate statement on Thursday, arguing it will help fuel further global “political instability”.Cop28: Australia to bring evidence it can meet 2030 climate target but pressure builds over fossil fuelsRead moreThe Albanese government is required under legislation to make a statement to parliament about progress towards achieving Australia’s emissions reduction targets, and also report on relevant international developments.An independent assessment of progress by the Climate Change Authority will also be tabled in parliament on Thursday, as will updated emissions projections covering its first full year in office. A snapshot of emissions projections released by Bowen last weekend suggests Australia will likely cut its CO2 pollution to 42% below 2005 levels by 2030 – which is nearly in line with the government’s 43% reduction target.Bowen will tell parliament on Thursday climate change presents “serious risks” to Australia and poses an “existential national security risk to our Pacific partners”. The minister will note security risks intensify “the further warming targets are exceeded”.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nBowen will warn the relationship between the level of warming and the security threats faced is not linear because threats “compound and expand exponentially the hotter the planet becomes”. Climate change will likely “accentuate economic factors already fuelling political instability, including risks to water insecurity across the globe”.The accompanying report to parliament prepared by Bowen’s department warns that allowing warming beyond existing targets “could cross as‐yet‐unseen thresholds and trigger abrupt, cascading impacts” such as the destabilisation of ice sheets leading to rising sea levels and melting permafrost releasing massive amounts of CO2 and methane far exceeding global greenhouse gas budgets.It says climate change is “likely to worsen global problems caused by rapid population growth, corruption, poor governance, weak infrastructure and conflict … [and] likely drive migration and displacement both within Australia and in many regional states, increasing the risk of ethnic or sectarian tensions or conflict over scarce land or water resources”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the lead-up to Cop28, Bowen has argued Pacific nations and other countries vulnerable to climate catastrophe should be the major beneficiaries of “loss and damage” funding, and a broader range of countries should bankroll the international effort along with the private sector."

She was caring for her father, 90, who was deteriorating from Parkinson’s disease and dementia, and looking after him had become increasingly difficult.Social life in her community in Johnson Fold, Bolton, had been Powell’s escape from the pressure at home, but when Covid restrictions were introduced “everything was just gone”. She was depressed, anxious and having panic attacks “like a washing machine on full spin”.Doctors had prescribed Powell pills for a host of ailments, mental and physical – “that much medication I’m surprised I don’t sound like a set of maracas when I walk”, she said. “But … having suffered with mental illness for the past 30 years I knew that this had got beyond where medication could help.“Medication can only do so much when you’re stuck in four walls.”That was when a nurse at her local surgery put Powell in touch with Trisha Goodwin, a social prescribing link worker at Bolton GP Federation. “Trisha mentioned about going on walks, and I was like, well, I love walking and if it’s a small group I don’t mind,” Powell said. She now credits Goodwin'’s suggestion with having helped saved her life.In response to a dramatic increase in mental health referrals around the pandemic, Bolton GP Federation and the Woodland Trust worked together to create a programme of “tranquility walks”, focusing on woodland, water and relaxation as a space to deal with anxiety.The group met at Barrow Bridge, a short walk from Powell’s home. Led by a Woodland Trust officer, they rambled through woodland on the Smithills estate, a site recently bought by the charity.It was a place Powell already knew and would visit to think. “But since doing the tranquility walks the thinking time has taken on a whole new meaning because I’m taking notice of the sounds, the smells,” she said.“The running water, because there’s a stream … and the birds’ song and the rustling of the leaves and the wind … it’s just nice to take time out. It’s lovely and it’s on my doorstep.”Vicky Entwistle, who works at the estate and led walks, said groups would stop to listen to branches and leaves swaying, or to watch dappled light through the canopy, an experience many found transformative.“It shows the importance of getting more nature to people’s doorsteps to help boost our health everyday, and the clear benefits of social prescribing with nature,” she said. Wildlife Trust is backing a petition to call on the government to enshrine in law a right to access to nature.The fortnightly Smithills tranquility walks have continued for a year now, and members of the group have formed strong bonds, Powell says. But she goes out more, when health permits it. She has become an advocate for open spaces, volunteering at Smithills – and sharing a newfound passion for mycology with her granddaughters.“I just forget everything when I’m out,” she said. “All my worries and stresses of home, stresses of family, and just lose track of time.”\nThis article was amended on 21 February 2022, to correct the spelling of Trish Goodwin’s name.\n"

To the Bajau, a “border” is merely the farthest distance they can reach by boat.Noted for their exceptional freediving abilities, the Bajau have evolved to have larger spleens, enabling them to stay underwater for up to 10 minutes at depths of 200 feet. Their diet includes a diverse array of sea creatures, including sea cucumbers – a valuable protein source also used for medical purposes and even as an aphrodisiac.\nOnly about 100 to 200 Bajau families still live on the traditional Lansa houseboats. This one, part of the Bohey Bual community off Bodgaya Island, has 10 sq metres of living space and houses nine people\nAs early as the 15th century, various bands of Bajau migrated between the Philippines and Malaysia’s Sabah region, fostering cultural exchanges and settlements. Life for the Bajau became more complex in the colonial era when Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia created maritime borders in the Sulu zone: these frontiers were established in the Madrid protocol of 1885, without bothering to consider the distribution and diversity of the ethnic groups who lived there.But it was the Malaysian Immigration Act of 1959/1963 that most significantly changed things for the Bajau. This legislation failed to distinguish between asylum seekers, refugees, irregular migrants and undocumented or stateless individuals.\nUsing self-taught carpentry skills, a Bajau can build a fishing boat in about a week without any drawings to work from. ‘These methods have been delivered from generation to generation, it’s in our genes,’ says Nalu, a Bajau who came from the Philippines 26 years ago\n\nFrom left: a Bajau girl wears a homemade rice powder sunscreen called borak buas; a Bajau family peek out from their stilt house off Bodgaya Island\nSuddenly the Bajau were in a precarious legal situation – one that worsened during the civil war in the Mindanao region in 1970, compelling numerous Bajau families to set sail for the east coast of Borneo, where they have grappled with Malaysia’s bureaucratic processes ever since – neither stateless nor citizen.\nUsing dugouts and nets, the Bajau fish the shallow waters around the island for fish, lobsters, sea cucumbers and sea urchins\nAs of 2023, only about 100 to 200 Bajau still live in the traditional “Lansa” houseboats near the eastern Malaysian city of Semporna. Lacking citizenship or formal rights to settle on the Borneo mainland, the Bajau of Philippine origins still preserve maritime hunting techniques passed down through generations. As well as relying on these techniques for subsistence, they trade surplus fish, lobsters and sea cucumbers with islanders, stocking up on essential survival items in return.\nBangau Bangau settlement in Semporna, Sabah (Borneo, Malaysia), where many Bajau eventually live\nHowever, the scarcity of funds for repairs, coupled with the local national park’s restrictions on cutting trees, are increasingly forcing those few who remain to consider moving to the mainland – where a life as displaced outcasts in the Bangau Bangau settlement seems inevitable.\nThe Bajau are considered the world’s best freedivers, a skill they rely on to catch fish and feed themselves\n\nAlmost every day Asli and Silaji take their spears and go fishing together. From an early age, the children of the Bajau comb the shallow waters in search of sea cucumbers or sea urchins. Any surplus catch is sold on the streets of Semporna\nOut in the vastness of the Sulu Sea, the Bajau stand as emblems of self-sufficiency, but once they set foot ashore they find themselves relegated to the lowest social class. Their stateless status deprives them of government privileges: the children cannot access public schools and adults are prohibited from finding formal employment.\nMen drying fish to preserve their catch as they don’t have refrigerators. Sundried fish can last for weeks\n\nSea urchins caught by the Bajau fishers\nWith a different conception of time to many mainlanders, and with little formal education, the Bajau remain apart – forced to fit in yet barred from doing so – while preserving, as they have for centuries, a unique way of life.\nOnce they set foot ashore, the stateless status of the Bajau deprives them of government privileges: the children cannot access schools and adults are prohibited from finding formal employment\n"

        "text": "As many as eight in 10 brown bear cubs born this year in a remote part of northern Japan have died amid a shortage of salmon, with experts blaming rising sea temperatures caused by the climate crisis.Along with acorns, pink salmon are an important source of food for the estimated 500 brown bears living along Hokkaido’s Shiretoko peninsula, a Unesco world heritage site known for its dramatic coastline and wild animals.Local officials reacted with alarm after a tour boat operator spotted a starving bear cub desperately searching for food on the peninsula’s eastern coast this month. The bear was reportedly turning over rocks and rummaging through piles of beached seaweed in search of food.Pink salmon that hatch in rivers in Hokkaido spend the winter in the sea, before returning to streams in Shiretoko between August and October to lay eggs. Brown bears typically lie in wait for the salmon as they make their way upstream, but have been forced to swim in the sea because of the shortage of river fish.“Some bears have grown really thin,” Katsuya Noda, the tour boat operator, told the Asahi Shimbun. “They are having a tough time, because there are no fish in the rivers, just like last year.”Experts said sea surface temperatures off Hokkaido remained above 20C from mid-July to early August 2021, 5C higher than average for that time of the year.Researchers at Hokkaido University have warned that if global heating continues at its current rate, seawater temperature around the island will rise by up to 10C in the 2090s compared with 1980s levels.Masami Yamanaka, a researcher at the Shiretoko Nature Foundation, told the Asahi that the lack of salmon, combined with a poor acorn harvest, was having a devastating effect on brown bear cubs. “An estimated 70% to 80% of the cubs born this year are dead,” Yamanaka said. “It’s a really serious situation.”Fishers caught 482,775 pink salmon in rivers in Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost main island, between 25 July and 5 September in 2020, but only 23,298 last year, according to the Hokkaido Salmon Propagation Association. Given statistical evidence showing that good catches occur every other year, the 2022 haul was surprisingly small.The scarcity of acorns has been blamed for a rise in the number of bear attacks on humans in Hokkaido and other parts of northern Japan, as they venture into populated areas in search of food.A total of 1,056 brown bears were caught and killed in Hokkaido in the year up to April 2022 – the highest figure on record and the first time the number has exceeded 1,000, according to the prefecture’s government. Of the total, 999 brown bears were exterminated to prevent damage to crops or because they were considered a danger to local people.The number of people injured or killed in incidents involving bears was 14 in the same period, with crop damage estimated at ¥262m (£1.44m) – both the highest figures on record."

The alert came as a result of elevated ozone levels across three regions of Pennsylvania, including the Philadelphia area, the Lehigh valley, and the central Pennsylvania counties of Cumberland, Dauphin, Lancaster, Lebanon and York, Penn Live reported.According to the department, young children, the elderly and those with respiratory issues are especially vulnerable to the effects of air pollution and should limit outdoor activities.Ozone forms as a result of airborne chemicals such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide reacting with sunlight. High ozone levels are most common during summer months due to long days of sunshine and high levels of airborne chemicals.The department encouraged residents on Sunday to conserve electricity by setting air conditioning to a higher temperature, combining errands to reduce vehicle trips, limiting engine idling, and refueling cars and trucks after dusk.The Maryland environmental department has also issued a code orange alert for Sunday in the Baltimore region.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Household gas and electricity bills began to soar in late 2021 and the price rises were exacerbated by a spike in wholesale gas costs after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Claire Coutinho, the energy secretary, angered MPs this week when she said that new oil and gas production “wouldn’t necessarily bring energy bills down” in announcing legislation to allow annual licensing rounds for new North Sea projects.Labour’s Alan Whitehead, the shadow energy security minister, said: “It was a stunning admission from this government that, during the worst energy bills crisis in generations, their flagship king’s speech energy policy won’t even take a penny off energy bills.“Now we find that the Conservatives are failing to take any meaningful action to upgrade Britain’s homes – despite the fact that energy efficiency is one of the best ways to cut bills for good.“The Conservatives are so out of touch that they have given up trying to bring down energy bills for British families.”Labour has pledged to devise a “warm homes plan” to give devolved administrations the power and the resources to bring every home in their area up to EPC standard C or higher within a decade.The Eco scheme was first launched in 2013 with the aim of cutting household energy bills by improving household insulation. In the first four years of the scheme, almost 1.7m homes were upgraded.The initiative was relaunched last year, offering support for households to move towards greener heating options, new boilers and cavity wall and loft insulation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "A wealthy landowner has accused Dartmoor National Park Authority (DNPA) officials of “acting like campaigners” as they prepare to appeal against a court decision to overturn the right to wild camp.Earlier this year, as a result of a court case brought by a local landowner, backpack camping, also known as wild camping, was made illegal on Dartmoor without landowner permission, overturning what campaigners claim was a long-held right to camping on the moor.Alexander Darwall, a hedge fund manager and Dartmoor’s sixth-largest landowner, brought a successful legal case against the national park last year, arguing that the right to wild camp on the moors never existed. Darwall, the owner of the 1,600-hectare (4,000-acre) Blachford estate on southern Dartmoor, offers pheasant shoots, deerstalking and holiday rentals on his land.On Friday, in a meeting during which the DNPA decided to appeal against the court decision, a spokesperson for the Darwall family embarked on a tirade against the authority. He said on behalf of the landowners that “you are not behaving as a public authority should. You are behaving like a campaigning organisation” and accused the DNPA of “indulging a mass trespass”.Earlier this year, thousands of campaigners descended on Dartmoor to assert their right to wild camp. However, despite claims by the agent, it was not legally a “trespass” as there is a right to roam across the national park.The spokesperson said the DNPA had acted in a “biased” way and criticised it for thinking of funding its appeal with money from the Dartmoor Preservation Association, which has so far raised more than £50,000 for legal fees. The legal case has been costly so far for the DNPA, which has recently had to shut visitor centres because of a lack of funds.The landowner’s spokesperson said: “If you take money from external bodies to fund a legal campaign indeed you encourage that funding … that is unwise for a public authority.”At the meeting, the DNPA voted to appeal against the court decision. Tom Usher, from the Dartmoor Preservation Association, said: “This is an excellent decision by the board members of DNPA. The massive public interest and financial support offered by thousands of people has been astonishing and we look forward to working with the national park to keep Dartmoor wild and free for all.”00:08:23‘This is a ransom note’: the battle for wild camping on Dartmoor - videoLewis Winks, from campaign group The Stars are for Everyone, said: “We are delighted that the appeal will now be heard. The regressive ruling must be challenged, and the right to camp on Dartmoor to be firmly re-established. We applaud DNPA members for showing leadership and making a stand for this vital principle of access. Wild camping is a right which we hope people will be able to enjoy for generations to come – here on Dartmoor and, in time, elsewhere in England.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We’re grateful to the landowners who, after the high court judgment, moved quickly to grant permission for people to backpack camp on their land.”Lawyers acting for the Darwalls have been contacted for comment."

        "text": "Italy is sweltering in abnormally high temperatures, but its media appear to be more interested in how the extreme heat is being reported in the foreign press than delving deeply into the effects in a country deemed to be among the most vulnerable in Europe to the climate crisis.Over the weekend, several outlets picked up on reports on Italy’s heatwave in leading foreign news websites – including the Guardian, the Times and the BBC. They were particularly fascinated by a headline in the Times calling Rome – where temperatures are forecast to reach highs of 43C on Tuesday – the “Infernal City”, a play on the nickname “Eternal City”. So much so that it was still a talking point come Monday.While there was coverage in Monday’s newspapers of the anticyclone that could push temperatures close to the European record of 48.8C in parts of Sardinia, Puglia and Sicily, most front pages led with the bufera, or storm, caused by the deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, calling for an amnesty for tax evaders.That the climate crisis is not well covered by the Italian media is unsurprising, said Gianni Riotta, the director of the school of journalism at Rome’s Luiss University. “It is lousy and it has been lousy for years,” he said.Much of this is due to the dominance of the rightwing media, which for decades have been owned or heavily influenced by the late former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Still today, rightwing newspapers such as Il Giornale, Libero and La Verità serve as mouthpieces for Giorgia Meloni’s government, whose strategy on tackling the climate crisis is vague.Greta Thunberg, the Swedish activist, has long been ridiculed by factions of the rightwing press. “Don’t forget that it was the Italian rightwing press which invented the word ‘Gretina’ in reference to Thunberg,” Riotta said. “Of course, for Italian ears this sounds like cretina (cretin).”Riotta, a former deputy editor of the more centrist newspaper Corriere della Sera, recalled Giuliano Ferrara, a former right-hand man of Berlusconi, who he said was a climate change denier and mounted a strong campaign against climate scientists.“Whenever we did work on the climate crisis, we would be blasted by people saying ‘this is too much’,” Riotta said.Stefano Caserini, a climate change professor at Milan polytechnic, said: “There are newspapers on the rightwing side which, if not openly denying the climate crisis, are inactivists. Over the next few years we will experience even more heatwaves, and currently the debate here is not really happening.”A study published last year by ECCO, a climate change thinktank, found that while the majority of Italians were fully aware of the impact of climate change and were ready to take collective action, there was a strong sense of mistrust towards politicians, institutions and the media, as well as a feeling of a lack of representation across the political spectrum on climate issues.Carlo Cacciamani, the chief of Italy’s national meteorological and climatology agency, said last week’s anticyclone was well covered by newspapers such La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera but media coverage generally lacked in-depth insight.“It’s not that the heat isn’t being discussed, what’s missing is the depth,” he said. “There needs to be more explanation on why this is happening and what is causing it.”Cacciamani said part of the problem was that the climate crisis theme “gets forgotten about” beyond the emergency of an extreme weather event. “During normal periods the theme needs to be prioritised – we need the media more than ever, and the process involves much more than just giving ‘shock’ news at the time of an event,” he said."

        "text": "Eight coal projects the New South Wales government will consider in 2023 would add at least 1.5bn tonnes to global greenhouse gas emissions if they all proceeded, according to analysis by Lock the Gate.The anti-mining group said it was the largest proposed expansion of coalmining in the state since the Paris agreement on climate change was signed and showed a need for changes to planning laws to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.The analysis considered eight proposed expansions of existing mines that could be assessed and determined in NSW in 2023.They include the Newstan mine near Newcastle, the Chain Valley colliery near Mannering Park and the Moolarben mine east of Mudgee.Lock the Gate produced its analysis using the projected carbon emissions in available project assessment documents.NSW could invest in coalmines if companies can’t raise the cash, Dominic Perrottet told gatheringRead moreThe group found the eight projects collectively would produce at least 1.5bn tonnes in greenhouse gas emissions, including what are known as scope 3 emissions from when the coal is sold and burned, mostly overseas.Most of those emissions – about 1.2bn – would be attributable to a single project, Glencore and Yancoal’s Hunter Valley operations project.Lock the Gate’s NSW coordinator, Nic Clyde, said the Perrottet government’s policy of allowing coal projects to continue was undermining its stated climate goals to cut emissions by 70% by 2035 and to reach net zero by 2050.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n“Dangerous climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels like coal has led to devastating extreme weather events all over NSW,” he said.“[The planning minister] Anthony Roberts should have amended planning laws to put a safe climate before coal and gas mining, but he has failed to do so.“Due to his failure to act, NSW is now staring down the barrel of the biggest climate bomb from coalmine expansions since the Paris agreement – putting our future at risk.”In assessments of other fossil projects, the state’s planning department has noted NSW had a large suite of climate policies but that policies to guide the assessment of developments such as mines and industrial facilities were not clear on how to assess emissions consistently.Independents calling for stronger climate policies and the ruling out of new coal or gas projects are targeting key Sydney seats in the state election next month.Victoria Davidson, the independent candidate for Lane Cove, said all government decisions should be viewed with the effects of the climate crisis in mind.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are now on track to halve emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels while growing the economy,” he said.A spokesperson for the planning and environment department said the impacts of all proposed mining projects were thoroughly investigated. They said the NSW Independent Planning Commission, which ultimately decides whether a project can proceed, also set strict conditions when projects were approved.They said all new projects would be considered against the target to reduce emissions by 70% by 2035 and the state’s strategic statement for coal exploration and mining, which set out the approach to transitioning to a low-carbon economy."

        "text": "A collection of pressed flowers taken from the hillsides of Bologna 500 years ago is unlocking knowledge about how the climate crisis and human migration is changing landscapes in northern Italy.Picked between 1551 and 1586 by the Renaissance naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi, the 5,000 delicately cut and dried plants form one of the richest collections of its time.The collection contains 5,000 dried plants picked by the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi. Photograph: Archivio Gbb/AlamyAldrovandi’s original purpose was to identify plant species and understand which could be used for pharmaceutical purposes. Nearly half a millennium later, his carefully pressed specimens are helping botanists document the enormous changes that have taken place in the surrounding landscapes, according to new research published by the Royal Society.During Aldrovandi’s time, Bologna’s hills were rich in species that are threatened or have even disappeared today, such as motherwort, which was used for medicinal purposes and is now likely extinct in the region. The total number of the species has increased since 1500s, but the quality of the flora has decreased, with many rarer species declining, researchers said. The Italian population increased by 560% during the study period.Aldrovandi’s herbarium is made up of 15 books, each containing up to 580 specimens glued to sheets. The collection includes notes on species’ frequency, abundance, ecology, local names and uses in folk medicine. Researchers believe it is the oldest example of a herbarium containing such detailed notes. “From a historical and scientific perspective”, the researchers write, “the importance of this herbarium is inestimable.”“Aldrovandi’s herbarium preserves the memory of the first signs of a radical transformation of the European flora and habitats,” the paper says.Leaves belonging to Cucurbita pepo – one of the oldest domesticated species – which yields varieties of courgettes, as well as squash and pumpkin. Photograph: Alma Mater Studiorum/Biblioteca Universitaria di BolognaOne part of that transformation is the huge influx of non-native species. At the time the collection was formed, just 4% of flowers were American species, which were almost exclusively cultivated in private or botanical gardens. Plants such as sweet pepper and courgettes were imported thanks to early exploration in Central and South America. Since then, there has been a 1,000% increase in non-native flowers from the Americas, which illustrates the growing importance of American-European trade routes from the Renaissance onwards.“We would never expect to see such a strong difference,” said the lead researcher, Dr Fabrizio Buldrini from the University of Bologna. “These increases are frightening, in some respects, because they are the unequivocal sign of profound human impact.”Buldrini’s team compared flora collected by Aldrovandi with collections made by Girolamo Cocconi (1883) and records compiled in the Emilia-Romagna region between 1965 and 2021. They looked at the plains area surrounding the River Po and its tributaries, where they could make comparisons across the datasets.‘Just keep going’: the horse-riding 97-year-old botanist battling for England’s wildflowersRead moreThe data also shows the effects of the “little ice age”, which extended through to the mid-1800s. High mountain species such as the silver cranesbill are typically found more than 1,700 metres above sea level, but Cocconi found it at 800 metres above sea level. The mountain buttercup is now only found above 1,000 metres, but during the “little ice age” it was found at 300 metres.Aldrovandi also helped create the city’s botanical garden, one of the earliest in Europe. A number of important collections were made around his time and in the centuries after, with Bologna becoming a “sort of cradle of modern botany and herbaria”.A scan of Gymnadenia conopsea, known as the fragrant orchid, collected in Bologna between 1565 and 1568. Photograph: Alma Mater Studiorum/Biblioteca Universitaria di BolognaSince the 1970s, there has been a project to map the region’s entire flora, resulting in a database with more than 500,000 records.Overall, the discovery highlights the importance of records of dried flowers, the researchers said. “A recent scientific trend is to dismiss these collections, which are regarded as dusty, cumbersome, unnecessary burdens – very expensive to stock and maintain and practically of no use for modern research. There is nothing more wrong: herbaria are indispensable and irreplaceable databanks for many research fields,” said Buldrini.Global collections contain 390 million specimens, according to the Index Herbariorum. Buldrini added: “Dismissing them would be like dismissing our historical archives, our monuments or our art collections.” This article was amended on 8 November 2023 to add text clarifying that Emilia-Romagna is a region of Italy and to correct an onward link to the source study.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X (formerly known as Twitter) for all the latest news and features"

        "text": "As the cold war thawed in the 1980s, the frozen high north of the planet was a leading beneficiary of more conciliatory times. Speaking in Murmansk in 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev called for an end to military competition in the Arctic, and a new focus on preserving its unique ecosystem. “The community and interrelationship of the interests of our entire world,” said the Soviet leader, “is felt in the northern part of the globe, in the Arctic, perhaps more than anywhere else.”Mr Gorbachev’s words paved the way for a cross-state consensus around the idea of “Arctic exceptionalism” – an agreement that in an environmentally crucial region, where Europe, North America and Asia meet, geopolitical rivalries should be put to one side. Since 1996, the Arctic Council, comprising the eight Arctic states including Russia, has embodied that spirit of cooperation. It is yet another disastrous consequence of Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine that it is now at risk.Since Russia’s invasion in 2022, the council’s western members have rightly refused a business-as-usual approach with Moscow. At a scientific level, this has meant lack of access to crucial data and the pausing of joint projects. That is no small matter, given that 40% of the Arctic is Russian. Meanwhile, the region’s natural resources – increasingly accessible due to disappearing sea ice – are being sucked into the fallout of Mr Putin’s war. In the sanctions-hit Kremlin, the alarming pace of global heating in the Arctic is being viewed primarily as an economic opportunity in tough times.Turning away from Europe, Mr Putin is stepping up collaboration on Arctic projects with China, following President Xi Jingping’s recent visit to Moscow. In March, Russia announced the creation of a joint working body with Beijing to develop the Northern Sea Route, which connects the eastern and western parts of the Arctic Ocean. An “energy superhighway” between Europe and Asia has become a high-priority strategic goal. China has already declared its aspirations for a “polar silk road” linking the two continents.As well as facilitating shipping routes, melting sea ice promises much easier access to abundant untapped oil reserves, gas and raw materials. In 2008, the United States Geological Survey estimated that the Arctic region contained the equivalent of more than 400bn recoverable barrels of oil. The exploitation of such resources, along with natural gas, would be entirely incompatible with global climate targets, and the European Union has committed to keeping Arctic oil and gas in the ground. But Russia is expanding its operations, not contracting them.The clear danger is that the breakdown of collaboration in the region, combined with Russia’s pivot to the east, leads to what the Finnish foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, has described as “an Arctic area with no common goal for climate change”. Given that respect for the sovereignty of states is one of the Arctic Council’s founding principles, it is difficult to see how Russia can be treated as a normal member while its war continues. On the other hand, the development of a competing Sino-Russian strategy for the region, making it a new theatre of great-power rivalry, is a deeply alarming prospect. Last week it was reported that the 2030s will see the first ice-free Arctic summers. The far north of the world has entered a zone of dangerous geopolitical uncertainty."

        "text": "Ella Roberta Adoo-Kissi-Debrah was a remarkable child. Energetic, joyful, active – she loved playing sport, reading books and making music. But living close to the South Circular Road in Lewisham, south London, from the age of seven she began to develop a chest infection and persistent cough. A happy, healthy child was disabled by chronic asthma.As her condition deteriorated, she suffered seizures and breathing problems, and was shifted from hospital to hospital. Ella died aged nine, in the early hours of 15 February 2013 – 10 years ago today.After tireless campaigning from her mother Rosamund, including a second inquest into her death in 2020, Ella became the first person in the UK to have air pollution listed as a cause of death on her death certificate in 2020.When I raised Ella’s case at prime minister’s questions two weeks ago, Rishi Sunak offered “thoughts and hearts” to Ella’s family. But in the words of Rosamund herself, being thought of on this day is nice – “but it’s not going to change anything, is it?”And change is desperately needed. If you thought tragic cases like Ella’s were a one-off, think again. A global study has linked almost a million stillbirths a year to air pollution exposure, and it is as bad as smoking in increasing the risk of miscarriage. Long-term exposure to even relatively low levels of air pollution can cause depression and anxiety. About 300,000 lung cancer deaths globally in 2019 were attributed to air pollution.If ministers were really thinking of Ella and her family on this day, they would adopt Ella’s law. Formally known as the clean air (human rights) bill, this legislation would make clean air a human right for all. It would give parents like Rosamund, who have lost children to air pollution, the right to take legal action under UK law and the resources to make that a reality.‘Thérèse Coffey ‘would have loved’ to set the PM2.5 target at 2030, but was unable to do so as it is ‘unachievable’.’ Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesIt would also establish a citizens’ commission on clean air – which would review government progress towards air pollution goals annually and advise ministers to tighten them if necessary. And crucially, it would require the government to reduce levels of PM2.5, one of the most toxic pollutants, to 10 micrograms a cubic metre by 2030, rather than the current target of 2040.This bill is going through parliament right now. And it has already, thanks to my Green colleague Jenny Jones, successfully passed through all stages in the House of Lords. But in the Commons, where I am now championing the bill, it has met roadblocks and murky misinformation.The environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, stated last week that she “would have loved” to set the PM2.5 target at 2030, as in the clean air bill, but was unable to do so as it is “unachievable”. This is not only an utterly bizarre statement, it’s also fundamentally wrong. A report by Imperial College London found that 97% of the country could reach the 10 micrograms target by 2030. The remaining 3% consists of hotspots in London that, with targeted support in the next few years, could certainly meet the requirements.This target hasn’t been plucked from obscurity. It matches the European Commission’s proposals for 2030. The chair of the Office for Environmental Protection, the government’s own environmental watchdog, recommended a 2030 target at a session of the environmental audit committee last week. The mayor of London has long supported a 2030 target. And the World Health Organization recommended that levels of PM2.5 should not exceed the 10 micrograms a cubic metre threshold as long ago as 2005.‘Remember me’: Ella’s law would be fitting legacy after London air pollution death, says motherRead moreBut Coffey’s statement raises another question. What kind of government would refuse to adopt targets on the basis that they’re too stringent, too rigorous, too beneficial for people’s health and the environment?There has been progress within this government. Michael Gove’s recent plan to adopt Awaab’s law, to tackle mouldy and damp homes and improve indoor air pollution shows that some ministers are starting to wake up to this public health crisis.But for Sunak to suggest at PMQs that his government’s measures on air pollution are “world-leading” is an outrage. Government data released this week shows that it breached its own national legal ceiling for PM2.5 in 2021. “World-lagging” would be more appropriate.The longer ministers hide behind misinformation and make excuses, the more people will get sick and die because of our toxic, dirty air. If the government wishes to honour the legacy of Ella Roberta Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, it must adopt this bill – and urgently.\nCaroline Lucas is the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion\n"

Studies show trees dramatically reduce the risk of flooding during downpours, while in heatwaves they cool the air and break up urban heat islands. Research also shows they can improve mental health, strengthen community relations – and can even reduce crime.Councils have stepped up their planting programmes in recent years as the multiple benefit of street trees are better understood. Many local authorities have watering programmes for younger trees to help them survive.However, tree cover in England is still among the lowest in Europe, and Linstead said it was crucial for residents to support trees in their neighbourhoods.“You won’t harm [them] by doing this and they’ll repay you in kind with shade in the future,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And I think that that’s what the process is about – bringing everybody together with differing views and finding that common ground that works for everyone.”Al Suwaidi has attended many conferences of the party (Cop) meetings under the UN framework convention on climate change. The UAE has come under fire for its choice of Sultan Al Jaber, the head of the country’s national oil company, Adnoc, as president of Cop28.Adnoc is planning major increases in its oil and gas production capacity. On Thursday, civil society groups in Bonn will protest against “conflicts of interest” over Al Jaber’s dual role in the negotiations. A preparatory session for Cop28, is being held this week in Bonn.Al Suwaidi said fossil fuels would form a key part of the discussions at Cop28, but whether a phaseout would be discussed as part of the official agenda of the talks was still up for grabs. “Our presidency is here for whatever the parties’ consensus is. The parties’ consensus is to have a discussion around fossil fuels. And we will support having a discussion around fossil fuels. It’s really up to the parties decide what they want to have on the agenda as part of this process,” he told the Guardian.“That’s what we as a presidency are focused on: finding the solutions that will allow everyone to go away feeling that they made significant progress and feel that it was worth the discussion.”But he added that there would still be a role for fossil fuels, even if the world targeted net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, which scientists say is necessary to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its latest comprehensive report on climate science, noted that there could be a small role for oil and gas, if used alongside technologies to remove carbon dioxide, even in 2050, when the world must reach net zero.Al Suwaidi said: “We know that that the energy mix that is going to achieve net zero is, if we’re serious about this conversation, going to include fossil fuels in some form. So I think that the discussion has to be about what is the proper mix, what is the proper language that allows us to achieve the emissions reductions that we need to achieve while allowing different pathways for different countries to achieve the net zero target.”But several prominent climate scientists, including IPCC authors, told the Guardian they were concerned about the IPCC findings being taken in this way. Although there could be a small amount of fossil fuel used while achieving this net zero, this should be minimal and not taken as a licence for fossil fuel producers to continue their operations, the scientists warned.Al Jaber, who will attend the Bonn talks on Thursday, met the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and several top EU officials on Wednesday. In a statement emerging from that meeting, they did not mention the phaseout of fossil fuels, but referred instead to pursuing “energy systems free of unabated fossil fuels”.The word unabated usually refers to the use of technology to capture and store carbon dioxide (CCS). Al Suwaidi also defended the use of CCS, which he said could be used to help avoid breaching the 1.5C limit.“We can’t be exclusive [of CCS],” he said. “We need every solution on the table, every solution that works for different people is a good solution. There’s no silver bullet here.”Hoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC, warned against over-reliance on CCS, in an interview with the Guardian at Bonn. He said it was “no free lunch” and that it would be expensive and difficult to implement, meaning there was a danger the world would continue to heat and overstep planetary boundaries, known as tipping points, that could trigger severe impacts from the climate crisis."

        "text": "Where has Storm Babet come from?Areas of low pressure have been pushing northwards across France, through the Channel and towards the UK and Ireland. According to Metdesk, strong winds from an east to south-easterly direction as opposed to the usual south-westerly direction that prevails across north-west Europe, are due to hit eastern Scotland and many eastern counties of England.On Wednesday, the Met Office issued a red weather warning for parts of eastern Scotland.What are the expected impacts?The Met Office’s chief meteorologist, Jason Kelly, says: “Eastern parts of Scotland will see exceptional amounts of rainfall over the next few days and the significant accumulations are likely to cause considerable impacts from Storm Babet.“Numerous amber and yellow rainfall warnings are in place for rainfall over the coming days, up to and including Saturday, but in the red warning area 100-150mm of rain is expected to fall quite widely, with some locations possibly seeing 200-220mm, which is expected to cause considerable impacts, with flooding likely.”There are warnings of the possibilities of a danger to life from floodwater, extensive flooding to homes and businesses and severely disrupted travel conditions.Which areas will be worst affected?The latest Met Office red weather warning covers Aberdeenshire, Angus, Dundee, and Perth and Kinross. The warning is in place from 6pm on Thursday until noon on Friday.What level of rainfall is expected?Some locations may see 200-250mm of rain, which is heavy, even for Scotland. The record for the most rain in one day was in 1974, when 238mm fell at the Sloy power station by Loch Lomond.How often are red warnings issued?According to the Met Office, red warnings are relatively rare as they are reserved for the most extreme weather impacts. Normally only one or two would be issued a year. This is the first red warning in 2023.How many red warnings have been issued?Of the dozen or so red warnings issued from 2011 to 2018, according to Metdesk, the vast majority were in December and January.There was a red warning for rain when Storm Dennis hit Wales in 2020, and one for wind in 2021 when Storm Arwen ran down the east coast of the UK.In July 2022 a red warning for extreme heat was issued in central and southern England, and earlier that year Storm Eunice triggered two red warnings for wind, covering areas of south-west and south-east England.Is the storm related to climate breakdown?It is too early to make an assessment of that kind. However, extreme rainfall is more common and more intense because of human-caused climate breakdown across most of the world, particularly in Europe, most of Asia, central and eastern North America, and parts of South America, Africa and Australia.Flooding has most likely become more frequent and severe in these locations as a result, but is also affected by human factors, such as the existence of flood defences and land use."

        "text": "The pineapple has been dethroned: Sainsbury’s has announced it will start selling a crownless version of the tropical fruit from Wednesday.The spiky, green leaves that grow from the top of the plant are a unique feature of the exotic fruit. But, says the supermarket, they are typically thrown away by customers, contributing to up to 700 tonnes of food waste a year.Removing the crown during the production process will mean the leaves can either be replanted in the pineapple fields or shredded and given to local farmers to be used for animal feed.Pineapples account for about 20% of global tropical fruit production. It is the second most cultivated exotic fruit on the planet after bananas.But the crowns can account for up to 80% of the fruit’s volume and without them, pineapples can be packed in the most efficient way possible, reducing carbon emissions and transport costs.Sainsbury’s said decrowning them was a simple idea with massive implications for environment as well as the supply chain.Losing the leaves, it said, could achieve a reduction of 2,500 boxes transported each year. The retailer is also removing all packaging previously attached to the standard-size pineapple, further reducing waste.The supermarket will continue to sell large pineapples with their leaves attached to “offer customers choice”.Claire Hughes, the director of product and innovation at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’re passionate about reducing our impact on the planet wherever we can, and we’re always looking for new and unique ways to make bold changes with sustainability in mind. Our new crownless pineapples may look a little out of the ordinary but they offer clear benefits in reducing waste and packaging.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The smoother and more uniform a fruit is, the less likely it is to be inspected at borders and the quicker processing will be.Sainsbury’s said that the pineapples would be ready to eat, with no need for customers to ripen them at home.But a 2017 study published in the Postharvest Biology and Technology journal, found that removing the pineapple crown after harvest aggravated internal browning – a considerable problem for pineapples that often causes severe economic loss in producing countries – and increased yellowing or ripening. The authors concluded that the crown was necessary for extending the shelf-life."

        "text": "The government is to loosen EU-derived laws on chemicals in a move experts say will increase the likelihood of toxic substances entering the environment.Under new plans the government will reduce the “hazard” information that chemical companies must provide to register substances in the UK. The safety information provided about chemicals will be reduced to an “irreducible minimum”, which campaigners say will leave the UK “lagging far behind the EU”.The UK’s scheme, called UK Reach, is falling behind the EU’s as it is. The UK has not been part of the bloc’s chemicals regulations scheme, EU Reach, since 2021. Eight rules restricting the use of hazardous chemicals have been adopted by the EU since Brexit, and 16 more are in the pipeline. The UK has not banned any substances in that time and is considering just two restrictions, on lead ammunition and harmful substances in tattoo ink.Campaigners have called for the government to follow EU chemicals regulations as standard, diverging only if and when there is a good reason to do so. This would free up time and money for regulators and mean dangerous chemicals banned by the EU do not enter the environment before there is time to ban them.Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said the government was “falling behind, leaving UK wildlife and consumers exposed to more toxic chemicals than our European neighbours”.He said the new scheme would “be a misguided step in the wrong direction, permanently damaging the ability of UK regulators to identify and prevent harmful chemical pollution”.Benwell said the new regulations prioritised cost savings for the chemicals industry over environmental protections, leaving “public health and nature to pay the price”.As an alternative, he said: “The government should commit to follow EU chemical restrictions as standard. It should also treat chemically-similar substances in groups to stop almost identical substances appearing on the market. This would free up time and money to follow global best practice, learning from countries around the world when other toxic risks are identified.”Ruth Chambers, of the Greener UK coalition, added: “The government promised that its new post-Brexit chemicals system would maintain high standards. Reducing safety information to an ‘irreducible minimum’ does not instil confidence that the new UK system will put the health of consumers and the environment first. The UK will be lagging badly behind the EU.”There are concerns that the UK regime is much less muscular than the EU’s, with less funding and fewer staff to work through lists of chemicals to see if they are enough of a danger to health and the environment to ban.Chloe Alexander, the UK chemicals campaigner at CHEM Trust, a charity that aims to stop synthetic chemicals from causing long-term damage to humans and wildlife, said: “These proposals demonstrate the faults of a standalone system which insists on being independent of EU Reach – that makes it extremely difficult to minimise costs on industry without leaving consumers and the environment less protected from harmful chemicals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This is very concerning as it is already too slow to keep pace with chemical threats and deal with the increase in chemical pollution in the environment.“This statement confirms our long-held view that the UK Reach model will continue to be a poor relation to EU Reach.”A Defra spokesperson said: “We are reviewing our legislation to see whether we can deliver more effective and efficient outcomes for both the environment and business.“We will continue to work closely with industry and other interested stakeholders to understand their concerns and discuss how these might be addressed while ensuring high levels of protection of human health and the environment.”"

While sea surface temperatures are near or slightly below average along the eastern coasts of Iberia, across the eastern Mediterranean temperatures remain high, with deviations of 3C-4C above normal for this time of the year, particularly in the Aegean Sea.The Black Sea is experiencing very large temperature anomalies of 4C-6C above normal. The duration and intensity of these abnormal temperatures classify these events as marine heatwaves, in categories 2 and 3. Such heatwaves can influence the marine ecosystems of a region, but also have an impact on weather patterns, with the relatively warm waters providing extra energy to the weather systems.On the other side of the Atlantic, a pre-Thanksgiving storm may bring hazardous weather conditions across areas of the eastern US, including heavy rain and thunderstorms as well as some gusty winds and snow. Thanksgiving Day itself is expected to be predominantly dry with sunny conditions across much of the country, but another storm is likely to bring sleet and snow to many areas of north-western states, including Utah, Nevada, Idaho and Wyoming, through Thursday and Friday, followed by a significant drop in temperatures into the weekend.Meanwhile, more than 3,000 towns and cities in Brazil were put on red alert for heat last week, with Rio de Janeiro recording the highest ever November temperature of 42.5C last Sunday. Temperatures have been widely reaching the mid- to high-30s, but peaking in the low 40s, affecting more than 100 million people in Brazil and Paraguay.The effects of this sustained heat have been felt across the Pantanal tropical wetlands in the Central-West region of Brazil, where there have been more than 2,000 fires in the first two weeks of November. In comparison, there were just 57 fires in the same region last year. Taylor Swift postponed her concert in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday due to the temperatures. It followed the death of a fan before Friday night’s show, which local authorities and politicians have suggested was linked to the extreme heat, which reached 39.1C in Rio on Friday.This heat is forecast to continue across parts of South America this week as daily temperatures remain at least 5C above average. In addition to extreme temperatures, Brazil’s National Institute of Meteorology has issued heavy rain and storm warnings for intense rainfall, gusty winds, and potential flooding across the south-east during the early part of this week."

The study, published in the journal Science, suggests locations with 250 visible stars at present will have just 100 visible stars in 18 years.“If these trends continue, eventually it will be very difficult to see anything at all in the sky, even the brightest constellations. Orion’s belt will start to disappear at some point,” said Dr Christopher Kyba, of the German Research Centre for Geoscience and first author of the research.Milky Way no longer visible to one third of humanity, light pollution atlas showsRead moreThe team write that the glow produced by artificial lighting grew exponentially over the 20th century with population growth, new technologies, and expansion of towns and cities.However the impact of a shift to light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in recent years is unclear. Satellites that can measure skyglow have limited resolution and cannot detect some wavelengths of light emitted by LEDs.To delve deeper, the team analysed 51,351 citizen scientist observations of stars visible to the naked eye, made between 2011 and 2022 as part of a project called Globe at Night. Participants were asked to use a website to view a selection of star charts for their location – each showing an incrementally greater number of the stars that exist in that patch of sky – and pick the chart that best matched what they could see. The researchers then created a model that related the number of visible stars to the brightness of the night sky.While the citizen science observations were rarely made multiple times in the exact same location, the researchers were able to group those with similar brightness of the night sky in a given year, and record the change over time.In 2016, scientists found the Milky Way was no longer visible to one-third of humanity. Photograph: Amr Dalsh/ReutersThe results reveal that on average across locations where participants made observations, sky brightness is increasing by 9.6% a year, with the figure slightly lower, at 6.5%, in Europe and slightly higher, at 10.4%, in North America.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Kyba noted the night sky in developing countries may be brightening even more rapidly than the global average suggested by the new study because they are electrifying for the first time. But, he added, the more people take part in the citizen science project the better able the team will be to focus on different regions, or even individual cities.The study is not the first to reveal the impact of light pollution on our ability to see the night sky. In 2016, scientists found the Milky Way was no longer visible to one-third of humanity.Kyba said the results shine light on the money and energy wasted in night lighting, which also has environmental impacts.Dr Greg Brown, planetarium astronomer with the Royal Observatory Greenwich, who was not involved with the work, said light pollution already limits astronomers’ ability to observe the night sky. “This study shows the stark reality of the problem and highlights how vulnerable unobstructed views of the cosmos really are in modern society,” he said.Martin Rees, the astronomer royal, said preserving the night sky isn’t just an issue for astronomers. “The night sky is part of our natural environment – indeed a unique part, in that it has been shared by people all the world over, throughout human history,” he said.Dr Constance Walker, another author of the study at the National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory in the US, agreed. “There is an irreplaceable awe that the natural night sky, a sky without any light pollution, provides. It inspires you and connects you to all of the wonders the cosmos holds,” she said.“If that source of inspiration is diminished by washed-out, light-polluted skies, then we lose part of ourselves and what we can strive to be. It is part of our cultural heritage.”"

The Flinders University researchers found the megafauna’s extinction could have, in turn, played a role in the end of the vulture and the eagles."

The charities created new meadows and restored old ones using seeds from remaining fragments of ancient and traditional meadows.The seeds from the 60 meadows were used to increase the amount of wildflower habitat, which is crucial for pollinators as well as being valuable in its own right as it includes rare plant species.A new audit of the project has found that 101 wildflower meadows have been created or restored, and they continue to expand as the charities harvest and spread the seeds in areas close to the original sites. The meadows have been found to benefit bees, butterflies, bats and birds.Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said: “The expansion of our beautiful wildflower meadows is a wonderful legacy for communities everywhere to enjoy. The magnificent sight of wild orchids shimmering in a field of delicate wild grasses in the afternoon sun to the hum of bees is something that everyone deserves to experience and enjoy.“As the nature and climate crises deepen, we must be bold if we want to reverse declines and help revive our meadow heritage.”He said ancient meadows had evolved alongside traditional farming methods over hundreds of years, and many of them had been designated as ‘local wildlife sites’ because of the rare and threatened plants they contained. However, he said, planning policy to protect them was limited and needed to be strengthened in the review of the national planning policy framework later this year.“We also need to see greater support for wildflower meadows in the new farm environment schemes – it is critical that farmers are rewarded for restoring locally distinctive natural habitats where wild plants can thrive.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You can either choose to get involved with the hydrogen village programme, and help pave the way to a greener future. Or you can choose to stay on natural gas if you do not wish to participate.”The changes mean Cadent will have to lay parallel gas mains in Whitby to supply local homes if the trial goes ahead, since existing mains will be used to bring hydrogen to the properties that take part.Those that opt in to the pilot will also receive a £2,500 cash payment and new hydrogen appliances that will be installed and maintained for free throughout the programme.

This week’s disaster laid waste to all of it.On a dirt pullout off a main road on Saturday, residents stood next to their cars and took in the sweeping view of the ruined town – singed and collapsing palm trees swaying in the wind, stone foundations holding up nothing, crumbling power lines and so many empty shells of buildings. The wreckage stretches all the way to the sea, a reminder of the ferocity and speed of the blaze that moved so quickly that residents ran into the water to escape the flames. Some spent hours in the ocean before they were rescued.Charred remains of an apartment complex in the aftermath of a wildfire in Lahaina, western Maui, Hawaii, on Saturday. Photograph: Yuki Iwamura/AFP/Getty ImagesThe true toll of the destruction is not yet known. The fires, the deadliest in recent American history, killed at least 93 people. Officials continue to warn that the number will likely grow, leaving those who live here and across Maui to reckon with unfathomable losses: friends, family, community members.Hawaii’s governor, Josh Green, has cautioned the state that “the full extent of the destruction of Lahaina will shock you”. It appears as if a bomb went off, he has said.But no amount of warning can prepare people for seeing their homes, or a community they knew and loved, wiped off the map. “Oh my god,” two Maui residents who traveled to the town with a van delivering medical aid from the humanitarian group Direct Relief repeated to themselves as the sprinter van wound its way through the ruins.The difference between seeing disasters on the news and having your community experience one firsthand is stark, said Felipe Hannel, a Maui resident who was helping deliver supplies with Direct Relief.“You see it on TV. You feel sorry for everybody. Maybe you lose sleep for a night, but then life keeps going,” Hannel said. “But when you know the place, it’s different. You’re crying. You get so emotionally involved. You know these people, you know their lives.”Just north of the devastated blocks of Lahaina, shopping centers have been transformed into resource hubs for those on the still closed western side of the island. Doctors distribute medical supplies, volunteers offer clothes and toiletries. In the parking lot of one plaza, in between Super Cuts, a spa and a DMV office, chefs with the World Central Kitchen served meals to families returning to the area. Meanwhile, the smell of smoke lingers, as if someone had just lit a match."

If she and her four teenage children run out of water in summer, it can be a two-week wait before more water is delivered via tanker.“I used to think the bandicoots were wildlife of mass destruction invading my lawn, but now I see that they’ve actually liberated me from ever having to mow it again,” said Murray, who is the proud owner of the inaugural trophy – a commemorative T-shirt. “I’m all for guilt-free weekends, especially since my ex-husband left with the lawnmower back in 2016.”Murray now celebrates the wildlife that comes into her garden, with species knowing they will not be disturbedThe competition began in Gotland, Sweden, two years ago, after the popular holiday island came within hours of running out of water the previous summer.The contest, devised by the municipality of Gotland, became global news after the Guardian picked up the story. Water consumption in Gotland has fallen by 5% thanks to the competition and other measures.Mimmi Gibson of the municipality said: “It’s a gentle way to nudge people into action and it automatically turns you into a climate hero by not doing anything. We need to start the conversation on how to save water. It’s a global problem. Sometimes, there’s pressure on people to keep their lawn really green and tidy and lush and it can be easier to say ‘I’m in this competition, I don’t need to water my lawn.’”Murray previously shrugged off criticism of her lawn by calling it “a paddock”, or claiming she’s waiting for the grass to grow so she can cut hay, but is now happy to talk about the biodiversity benefits of her laid-back gardening style.Murray said she used to think of bandicoots as weapons of garden destruction but now says they ensure she’ll never have to mow her lawn againBlue-tongue lizards, kangaroos, wallabies and pademelons all visit from the neighbouring nature reserve. “I’ve chosen to make my place an extension of the nature reserve because it is right beside it. That’s another excuse for me not watering my lawn. Do you water Cradle Mountain? No. It just looks after itself. By and large, that’s what’s happened.”The jury took nearly two hours of deliberations to reach their verdict on the ugliest lawn.“All of them were hideous and well worthy of winning but the winning entry was really, really bad,” said Gibson.Diarmuid Gavin, the garden designer and broadcaster who was also a member of the jury, said it was the weirdest competition he had been asked to judge but he hoped it would encourage people to ditch old attachments to green lawns and create climate-appropriate gardens.“Seeing a lawn in Tasmania like this, wondering why there’s a prize for the world’s worst lawn, really makes people think but with that sense of humour, without lecturing or hectoring,” he said. “The Tasmanian garden was soulful because it had an understanding of what’s happening. If we’re lucky enough to look after a piece of land, we all need to be thinking gardeners now. The moral imperative isn’t so much to fit in, or not let the neighbourhood down, it’s to not let the planet down.”Murray added: “You’ve got a choice to make – do you want farmers to have enough water to produce food for a growing human population or do you want to play some type of lawn nazi competition with your neighbours to make them jealous of how green your lawn is?”“It brings me a lot of joy to see all the little creatures who now feel safe to come out during the day in my back yard – they’ve got camouflage, they have happy digging areas. It really enhances my feeling of inner peace knowing that I’m playing a microscopic part to help other things.”"

Reports of Shell and British Gas’s profits in the first six months of 2023 has reignited the debate over how politicians balance the cost of pursuing the target with keeping voters onside.British Gas reported its highest-ever first-half profits, of almost £1bn, while Shell has reported profits of just over $5bn (£3.9bn) for the second quarter of the year.Miliband said Sunak had been “dragged kicking and screaming” to implement a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. The existing policy was like a “Swiss cheese” and “full of holes”, the Labour frontbencher claimed.He called for the current rate, 75% of profits, to be upped to 78%, and criticised the so-called super-deduction that allows companies to reduce their payment if they invest in British energy projects, saying Labour would close the “loophole”.“These are unearned, unexpected profits,” Miliband told BBC Breakfast “This is because Russia launched an appalling invasion of Ukraine and drove gas prices up.“The only long-term answer is to move off fossil fuels as quickly as we can because even though we imported very small amounts from Russia before the war, we’ve been so badly affected as a country.“That’s why the drive to increase onshore wind, solar energy, offshore wind – cheaper than fossil fuels – is the right answer for the country. And my regret is not just that we don’t have a proper windfall tax, it’s that we don’t have a government committed to that green sprint either.”Under a Labour government, Miliband said the “north star” of its energy plans would be a drive to ensure all electricity comes from zero-carbon sources by 2030, which he added would cut bills across the economy by £93bn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Where there are costs, we don’t leave people to shoulder them alone.”When Miliband was challenged over Labour having delayed its plans for £28bn a year of spending on green jobs and industry, he stressed it was important for the party to “meet our fiscal rules”.Dismissing any suggestion he was at loggerheads with the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, or the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, Miliband praised them both and said: “We are absolutely united on this.”"

Corpus Christi has hit 125F (51C), while Rio Grande Village notched 118F (47C) and Del Rio marked 115F (46C). States including New Mexico, Louisiana, Arkansas, Kansas and Missouri are also experiencing scorching heat, with the National Weather Service predicting the temperatures to rise further and last into the week of 4 July.The heat follows a weekend of destructive storms that left hundreds of thousands of people without power. The heat dome, as it is known, has settled above Mexico and parts of the US south-west and is caused by hot ocean air that has become trapped in the atmosphere.When I look at this jet stream the word insane comes to mind. It's even more astonishing when you consider it's mid June! This configuration, likely enhanced by climate heating, is fueling a record heat dome so extreme that even experts are astonished! pic.twitter.com/GPbd0rjpst— Jeff Berardelli (@WeatherProf) June 20, 2023“These conditions are very stressful to the people living in the region. We are seeing a really intense, wide-spread, and long-lasting event,” said Andrew Pershing, director of climate science at non-profit Climate Central. “Human-caused climate change made these conditions more than five times more likely.”Earlier this week, Texas’s power utility urged users to cut back on air conditioning to alleviate the stress on the grid. Emergency crews in the Tulsa, Oklahoma, region have responded to a record number of calls owing to the heat and lack of power, according to the New York Times. In Jackson, Mississippi, residents reported not having power and air conditioning for nearly 100 hours, NBC reports.An average of 702 heat related deaths happen in the US each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2021, 69 people in Oregon died from heat caused by a heat dome. On Thursday, an Oregon county filed a lawsuit against fossil fuel companies, arguing that the oil and gas companies are accountable for the heatwave.Unrelenting heat presents particular health and safety risks to older adults, young children, pregnant women, people with chronic conditions and outdoor workers. People of color and low-income residents bear a higher burden from heat, whether because of their occupation or living in close proximity to heat exacerbating industries and heat-trapping highways. At home, vulnerable communities might lack adequate air conditioning.“If you’re struggling financially and worried about paying your electric bill, you might not run your AC long enough, which is going to increase your vulnerability,” Pershing said.Heatwaves like these “will become more common in the future as we continue to burn coal, oil and natural gas”, Pershing said."

        "text": "The World Bank is investigating allegations of killings, rape and forced evictions made by villagers living near the site of a proposed tourism project it is funding in Tanzania.The bank has been accused of “enabling” alleged violence by the Tanzanian government to make way for a $150m (£123m) project ministers say will protect the environment and attract more tourists to Ruaha national park.The “resilient natural resource management for tourism and growth” (Regrow) project will almost double the size of the park, which is 130km (80 miles) from the city of Iringa.Villagers living near Ruaha told researchers at the Oakland Institute thinktank that rangers had killed and beaten cattle herders and fishers, had raped women and confiscated thousands of head of cattle, under the premise that they had encroached on the national park.In April 2021, rangers reportedly shot and killed William Nundu, a fisher, and allegedly killed two herders, Sandu Masanja, and Ngusa Salawa, who was only 14 years old. The regional police commander claimed that they were killed by wild animals while illegally entering the park, according to a report published by the institute on Thursday.More than 21,000 people from dozens of villages around Ruaha are also facing eviction by the government, it claimed.Anuradha Mittal, the executive director of the Oakland Institute, said: “[The] Regrow project is not about protecting wildlife or conservation. Instead, the bank is financing an oppressive and violent economic growth model based on boosting tourism revenues.”Mittal said the World Bank should have scrutinised the Tanzanian government’s record on human rights before financing it. The government authorised evictions close to the same area in 2006 and has been criticised for its handling of forced evictions in northern Tanzania, which “should have triggered internal alarm before the bank decided to finance the project”, added Mittal. “Instead, it looked the other way and continues to do so. It should be held accountable.”The institute said villagers were told in October 2022 they would have to leave their land despite holding title deeds, which the government has cancelled, claiming the property fell within the boundaries of the national park.More than 850 villagers have challenged the evictions in Tanzania’s high court.A Maasai man in Loliondo – 1,000km away from Ruaha – who claims he was was shot in the back by Tanzanian security forces. Critics say the violence there ‘should’ve triggered internal alarm’ at the World Bank before financing the Regrow project.  Photograph: Daniel Irungu/EPATwo community members, with the help of Oakland, have also submitted a complaint to the World Bank saying they had not been consulted about the evictions or provided adequate resettlement plans for the projects, which were causing “harm to their identity, culture and rights”.A community leader who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity called the government’s actions “heavy-handed and unlawful”. He said communities in more than 40 villages will lose ancestral and lawfully owned land.“Many farmers were barred from cultivating their farms this year causing hunger and poverty. Many of the residents of the villages in question face an uncertain future and psychological pain,” he said.“I want the World Bank to immediately halt the project and conduct forensic investigation on the allegations of gross violation of human rights in the project area.”Roland Ebole, an Amnesty International researcher focusing on Tanzania and Uganda, said abuses around the park have been reported since 2008 when the government first began to scope out plans for its expansion.‘It’s becoming a war zone’: Tanzania’s Maasai speak out on ‘forced’ removalsRead more“We find villagers being accused of herding inside areas they have been restricted from and they are told to pay fines of high amounts or have their cattle confiscated. I know villagers who have been willing to pay fines but officials hold them in custody for days,” said Ebole.He said tourism, much of it linked to trophy hunting, has driven a need for the government to take land, even at the expense of the people living there and often without their consent.“You find them going to the most rural areas with the assumption the people are ignorant and most times they fail to consult them on issues regarding their land, sometimes ancestral land, and issue ultimatums to move,” said Ebole.A World Bank spokesperson said: “The World Bank takes the allegations very seriously, and we are looking into them, working with the bank’s inspection panel. If a project doesn’t adhere to the social and environmental standards, we want to know about it and more importantly we want to improve it.”"

In some areas, oil and gas production, which typically resists weather-induced shutdowns, was briefly shuttered.Canada: images of felled ancient tree a ‘gut-punch’, old-growth experts sayRead moreOn Friday, the province’s firefighters and members of the Canadian military were working to prevent blazes from becoming “too big and powerful”, said Christie Tucker, a spokesperson for Alberta Wildfire.A brief period of cool weather and rain helped tamp down some of the blazes, but officials will be watching carefully to see how winds interact with the hotter conditions.“Certainly the conditions we’ve seen in the last few days have helped a significant amount and we’ve seen low fire activity, which means we’ve been able to make [some] progress on those,” Tucker told reporters. “But a wind gust will have a significant impact on a wildfire and that’s what can turn one of those smaller new starts into a larger fire very quickly.”Florida-based meteorologist Jeffery Berardelli told the Guardian that recent projections show a higher pressure system developing over the Canadian Prairies that is “stronger than anything we have seen” since records started four decades ago.“A ‘heat dome’ like this is a very rare occurrence in this part of the world this time of year,” he said in an email. “Historically and statistically speaking, it is rarer than a 1-in-1,000-year event.”Berardelli said the climate of the region was now hotter than previous decades, meaning these rare events will become more likely in the coming years.Despite the intensity of 2021 heatwave which killed more than 600 people in British Columbia and caused mass die-offs of marine life, the current weather system is unlikely to cause widespread fatalities, given the cooler night-time temperatures.Still, in some parts of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Washington, Oregon and Idaho, temperatures will probably hit more than 15C over historical norms.A recent study from the Climate Central found the upcoming ‘heat dome’ the “clear fingerprints of climate change” and has made the record-breaking temperatures five times more likely.Spring temperatures in the region have been drier and hotter than normal in recent years, pushing the start of the fire season earlier and earlier. But with more than 410,000 hectares of forest burned since January – more than double the amount typically burned in an entire season.Alberta has seen more than 6,500 applications for emergency financial assistance and paid out nearly C$2m; 16,470 remain displaced throughout the province.‘Like Nagasaki’: devastating wildfires will only get worse, new book warnsRead moreRural Indigenous communities are often on the frontlines of climate change and have been among the hardest-hit in the recent fires. In Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation, 45 buildings including the community’s elder centre, have been burned. Nine First Nations in Alberta remain under threat of wildfire, forcing more than 2,000 people from their homes.“Fire isn’t going away. We’re going to be burning for this entire century. We’re going through a global regime change and a whole bunch of things are going to catch on fire, and catch on fire again, until something new grows there, something different grows there or nothing grows there,” said John Vaillant, author of the book Fire Weather.“This is a global shift. It’s an epochal shift, and we happen to be alive for it.”"

This sentence doesn’t usually elicit a collective groan of despair, but after three arid weeks, the gardeners of south-west England are entitled to sigh a bit. In my local Fox’s Field, volunteers from Wellington’s Transition Town group are hauling water from the stream up the slope to carefully rehydrate the herbs in their newly planted forest garden.The ground is covered with a layer of woodchip, hay and municipal soil improver. It has been so toasted by the sun that you can crumble it in your fingers like granola. At intervals, tufts of green poke up through the mulch: oregano and lemon balm, bergamot and sweet cicely, chamomile and clary sage. Over the past month, 273 plants have been planted, with 198 still to go, representing hundreds of volunteer hours, and costing about £1,800 in grant money. There’s a lot at stake.The last rain fell in biblical proportions. On 9 May, the air turned beige, lightning crackled, and thunder rolled from Blackdowns to Quantocks and back again like a timpani section gone mad. The rain, when it finally fell, hammered the freshly ploughed fields, blasting away the topsoil like a pressure washer. Roads turned into rivers, carrying away whatever nutrients farmers had applied, and rivers boiled with frothy Nescafé-coloured water. Half the average month’s rain fell in the space of 24 hours.Volunteers for Transition Town Wellington at work. Photograph: Anita CorbinIt’s not so much the quantity as the quality of the rain that’s the issue: a “wet” month isn’t much use if it all falls at once. Quite the opposite, in fact. And after the flood, the run of bone-dry days and chilly nights have made the usually soggy south-west feel like the high sierras. No wonder the plants are struggling.In the forest garden, the team has spent the past 18 months suppressing the grass with cardboard, hay and woodchip, and in one section a huge sheet of black plastic. Not only does this “no dig” method help retain the soil structure, and avoid releasing carbon into the atmosphere as conventional ploughing does, it also provides the soil with a protective layer. It is less likely to dry out, is more stable and absorbent, and therefore richer in nutrients and microbial activity.But if the current conditions prevail, without the intervention of these water-bearing humans, even these lucky plants will eventually die.

Climate change, meanwhile, threatens food sources for the young Chinook maturing in the Pacific.Now, ocean salmon fishing season is set to be prohibited this year off California and much of Oregon for the second time in 15 years after adult fall-run Chinook, often known as king salmon, returned to California’s rivers in near record-low numbers in 2022.“There will be no wild-caught California salmon to eat unless someone has still got some vacuum sealed last year in their freezer,” said John McManus of the Golden State Salmon Association.Experts fear native California salmon, which make up a significant portion of the Pacific north-west’s fishing industry, are in a spiral toward extinction.Much of the salmon caught off Oregon originate in California’s Klamath and Sacramento rivers. After hatching in freshwater, they spend three years on average maturing in the Pacific, where many are snagged by commercial fishermen, before migrating back to their spawning grounds, where conditions are more ideal to give birth. After laying eggs, they die.Already California’s spring-run Chinook are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, while winter-run Chinook are endangered along with the central California coast coho salmon, which has been off-limits to California commercial fishers since the 1990s.The Pacific Fishery Management Council, the authority responsible for setting ocean salmon seasons off the Pacific coast, is expected in early April to formally approve its proposed closure of Chinook fishing along the coast from Cape Falcon in northern Oregon to the California-Mexico border. Salmon season is expected to open as usual north of Cape Falcon, including in the Columbia River and off Washington’s coast.Though the closure will deal a blow to the industry that supports tens of thousands of jobs, few are disputing it.“We want to make sure they are here for the future,” said third-generation fisherman Garin McCarthy, who described catching a Chinook as “magical”.McCarthy, whose entire income last year came from salmon fishing off both California and Oregon, has had to invest thousands of dollars in equipment to fish other species like rockfish, halibut and black cod.“We’re all scrambling to try to make our boats do something different,” he said. “We’re all salmon trollers. That’s what we do. That’s what we live for.”Glen Spain, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, said he believed the ban might need to be in place for two or three years to bring back sustainable stocks after many fish died in 2020, the start of a record dry period.The Chinook already faced challenges, with dams blocking their historic retreats to the chilly upper reaches of northern California’s Sacramento River and the Klamath River along the California-Oregon border. Decades of development have disrupted the natural flow of rivers and polluted waters.In 2020, the Trump administration ended federal protections for millions of waterways, allowing for more water to be pumped out of the Sacramento River Basin for farming despite warnings from biologists that it could harm salmon runs in the future.Fishers say river water temperatures increased with the diversions for irrigation, killing more eggs and hatchlings and preventing the stocks from bouncing back amid the drought.In 2021, a judge determined the Trump administration improperly limited federal protections and restored them to a narrower 1986 standard. The Biden administration is expected to expand the protections in 2024.Some are banking on the unusually wet winter to bring relief. Record rain and snowfall since late last year have freed two-thirds of California from drought. But too much water could also flush out eggs and hatchlings.Businesses tied to salmon want the government to declare the situation a federal disaster so they may receive aid. As the market shrinks, more restaurants turn to farm-raised salmon, while gear suppliers stop stocking the proper equipment to fish Chinook."

        "text": "Dust that billows up from desert storms and arid landscapes has helped cool the planet for the past several decades, and its presence in the atmosphere may have obscured the true extent of global heating caused by fossil fuel emissions.Atmospheric dust has increased by about 55% since the mid-1800s, an analysis suggests. And that increasing dust may have hidden up to 8% of warming from carbon emissions.The analysis by atmospheric scientists and climate researchers in the US and Europe attempts to tally the varied, complex ways in which dust has affected global climate patterns, concluding that overall, it has worked to somewhat counteract the warming effects of greenhouse gasses. The study, published in Nature Reviews Earth and Environment, warns that current climate models fail to take into account the effect of atmospheric dust.“We’ve been predicting for a long time that we’re headed toward a bad place when it comes to greenhouse warming,” said Jasper Kok, an atmospheric physicist at UCLA who led the research. “What this research shows is that so far, we’ve had the emergency brake on.”Revealed: Exxon made ‘breathtakingly’ accurate climate predictions in 1970s and 80sRead moreAbout 26m tons of dust are suspended in our atmosphere, scientists estimate. Its effects are complicated.Dust, along with synthetic particulate pollution, can cool the planet in several ways. These mineral particles can reflect sunlight away from the Earth and dissipate cirrus clouds high in the atmosphere that warm the planet. Dust that falls into the ocean encourages the growth of phytoplankton – microscopic plants in the ocean – that absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.Dust can also have a warming effect in some cases – darkening snow and ice, and prompting them to absorb more heat.But after they tallied everything up, it seemed clear to researchers that the dust had an overall cooling effect.“There are all these different factors that play into the role of mineral dusts in our atmosphere,” said Gisela Winckler, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. “This is the first review of its kind to really bring all these different aspects together.”Although climate models have so far been able to predict global heating with quite a bit of accuracy, Winckler said the review made clear that these predictions haven’t been able to pin down the role of dust especially well.Limited records from ice cores, marine sediment records, and other sources suggest that dust overall had also been increasing since pre-industrial times – in part due to development, agriculture, and other human impacts on landscapes. But the amount of dust also seems to have been decreasing since the 1980s.More data and research is needed to better understand these dust patterns, Winckler said, and better predict how they will change in coming years.But if dust in the atmosphere is decreasing, the warming effects of greenhouse gases could speed up.“We could start to experience faster and faster warming because of this,” Kok said. “And maybe we’re waking up to that reality too late.”"

As a result, there is now a stable population of about 37,000 birds wintering there, according to SEO/Birdlife.“It’s not new for birds to take advantage of this food supply, but what we are seeing is a change in migratory behaviour, especially in the case of white storks,” Pinilla said.“Until relatively recently, all the European white storks wintered in Africa, and as the rubbish dumps have grown larger, the birds have learnt that if there’s enough food here there’s no need to make a 3,000km [1,850-mile] journey to sub-Saharan Africa to find something to eat.”Strong crosswinds complicate the 8-mile journey and any bird that falls into the sea is likely to die there, as they are unable to regain flight, so the better fed they are before they set off, the better their chance of survival.Researchers say that as well as food, the birds eat a lot of plastic, rubber and toxic substances on the landfills. There are also rats, which the kites hunt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

As a result, the European white stork population has increased dramatically since the 1980s.The climate crisis is also driving birds, especially migratory species, to adapt. Two successive hot summers, combined with a prolonged drought in much of Spain, are forcing some species to change their habits.“We don’t have all the facts, but it seems highly likely that, in the case of storks, which need wetlands to feed and to reproduce, they have probably changed their behaviour as a result of the drought and may have produced fewer young,” Pinilla said."

The extent of these fires, more than double the size of the previous record, caused more than a dozen fatalities and thousands of evacuations, and sent a plume of smoke that unfurled as far as Norway and, for a time in June, turned the sky above New York City orange.The Hawaii fires are a dire omen of the climate crisis’s cost to Pacific peoples | Kiana DavenportRead moreScientists have now analyzed the conditions that caused the fires that raged in the Canadian province of Quebec between May and July and found that the climate crisis, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, made them at least twice as likely, and the fire-prone weather at least 20% more intense.The attribution study, conducted by a coalition of scientists in Canada, the UK and the Netherlands, found that while the fire-prone weather conditions were unprecedented, they are no longer unexpected and will become more commonplace as the worlds continues to heat up.“The word ‘unprecedented’ doesn’t do justice to the severity of the wildfires in Canada this year,” said Yan Boulanger, research scientist at Natural Resources Canada and part of the World Weather Attribution study team.“From a scientific perspective, the doubling of the previous burned area record is shocking. Climate change is greatly increasing the flammability of the fuel available for wildfires – this means that a single spark, regardless of its source, can rapidly turn into a blazing inferno.”The new study looked at the fire weather index, a metric that gauges the risk of wildfire through a combination of temperature, windspeed, humidity and rainfall, and found that its peak in Quebec from May to July, when there was a huge number of fires, had its chances of occurring doubled because of the climate crisis. The fires in this peak were also 20% more intense because of the climate crisis.While climate change itself doesn’t typically ignite huge forest fires, it helps set the stage for them by drying out vegetation that becomes easy fuel for flames. The early stages of summer were ideal conditions for this, with Canada’s national temperature record for May and June smashed by 0.8C (1.4F), which, along with low humidity and the shrinkage of snow cover, aided the rapid spread of fires across Canada.Philippe Gachon, a researcher at the Université du Québec à Montréal, said that snow cover has traditionally limited the extent of wildfires in Canada, but that this is changing.“This year, high temperatures led to the rapid thawing and disappearance of snow during May, particularly in eastern Quebec, resulting in unusually early wildfires,” he said. “The ongoing loss of snow in a warming climate means that wildfires will burn for many more days each year in Canada.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

New York temporarily had the worst air quality in the world due to the smoke, prompting people to stay indoors and don masks not worn since the height of the Covid pandemic.Scientists were previously reluctant to link any individual event, or events, to the climate crisis but the emerging field of attribution has enabled researchers to make stronger and swifter conclusions about the influence of global heating upon extreme weather. Recent studies have shown that the heatwaves that have stricken the US, Europe and China this year were almost impossible without the conditions caused by the climate crisis.“Increasing temperatures are creating tinderbox-like conditions in forests in Canada and around the world,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London.“Until we stop burning fossil fuels, the number of wildfires will continue to increase, burning larger areas for longer periods of time.”"

The Cadia general manager, Mick Dewar, told the inquiry that the mine notified the EPA and Department of Planning and Environment in August 2022 that they had taken measurements that exceeded the clean air regulations. The mine has since installed filtration units, called “bag houses”, at a cost of $10m per year. Building a permanent filtration system will cost an additional $36m, Dewar said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said that “at no point in time has there been any evidence suggesting that VR8 is actually depositing dust or allowing dust to escape the mine lease in levels that exceed any of those accepted standards or our project approvals”.The company received two $15,000 fines from the EPA in 2022 for failing to conduct continuous air quality monitoring and dust pollution. Newcrest’s interim chief executive, Sherry Duhe, rejected a suggestion at the inquiry last week that the fines were seen as “just a cost of doing business”.“Our very strong aim is never to be penalised and to always be in compliance,” she said. “For us, it’s really very important that we comply with regulations, that we are a good community neighbour and that we have that proactive positive relationship for decades to come.”Hearings in the upper house inquiry are scheduled to continue in Orange on Tuesday and in Mudgee on Wednesday.A sentencing hearing will be held in the NSW land and environment court on 28 March 2024."

The operator of the project said it expects to have five turbines operational in the early part of this year, before eventually having 62 turbines as part of the project, which will produce enough electricity to power 400,000 homes.UN experts alarmed by Alabama plan to kill prisoner using untried gas methodRead more“This is a historic moment for the American offshore wind industry,” said Maura Healey, the governor of Massachusetts. “This is clean, affordable energy made possible by the many advocates, public servants, union workers and business leaders who worked for decades to accomplish this achievement.”The US has been slow to develop offshore wind compared with some other countries, but Biden has enthusiastically backed the concept, with the White House setting a goal to deploy 30GW of offshore wind by 2030, enough to power 10m homes with clean energy, and several projects are now planned.Vineyard Wind, about 15 miles (24km) off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard, is the largest so far and its launch is “truly is a milestone for offshore wind and the entire renewable industry in North America”, according to Tim Evans, a partner at Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, which is developing the project with Avangrid, which is itself owned by a Spanish electricity utility.The breakthrough, which has occurred more than a year after developers started assembling and installing the 850ft-tall turbines in the ocean, comes just a month after a separate, smaller, project begun off the coast of New York. The 12-turbine project, called South Fork Wind, is operated by the Danish wind energy developer Ørsted and the utility Eversource.The arrival of Vineyard Wind is a welcome tonic to a nascent offshore wind industry that has struggled in the US in recent months, despite support from the Biden administration and amenable east-coast state governors.On Wednesday, the energy giants Equinor and BP terminated their agreement to sell power to New York state from their 1,260MW Empire Wind 2 offshore windfarm, citing rising inflation, higher borrowing costs and supply chain issues. Equinor blamed “changed economic circumstances on an industry-wide scale”.Last year, Ørsted also canceled two large offshore wind projects in New Jersey due to concerns over high costs, supply chain problems and the failure to secure hoped-for tax credits.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Gardeners’ attitudes to insects, like those of humans in general, are a mixed bag. Butterflies’ brief, fluttering lives make them beloved wonders. Bees have long been a source of fascination as well as honey. But the reason why some creepy-crawlies have been classified as pests while others haven’t goes beyond appearances. Horticulturalists, like farmers, generally object to insects that eat what they grow.This hasn’t saved the creatures that don’t consume crops or garden plants. Habitat loss resulting from urbanisation and deforestation, and pesticide use in agriculture, mean that global insect populations are in steep decline. In the UK, the number of flying insects is estimated – by looking at vehicle number plates – to have fallen by 58.5% between 2004 and 2021. Awareness of the importance of bees and other pollinators has risen in the past decade. But human dependence on insects goes beyond this. They form a crucial part of multiple ecosystems.The changes in land use and agriculture that will be needed to reverse these alarming trends depend on policymakers. The UK government has broken its promise to replace subsidies under the common agricultural policy with sustainability incentives worth the same amount. It also lags behind France and other countries by continuing to allow non-agricultural pesticide use – although some local councils have imposed their own bans or phase-outs. Next year’s ban on peat-based garden compost is a positive step but should have happened sooner.Gardeners as well as politicians have a role to play by adopting new techniques, and aesthetics, which reflect the needs of nature. Insects, birds and spiders – highly visible at this time of year, when many common species breed – need food and places to nest. Gardeners should include wildlife-friendly trees such as crab apples where possible, and avoid weedkiller as well as insect poisons. Other beneficial changes include planting a greater variety of plants, ideally including some native species (or relatives of natives), which are more hospitable to local wildlife because they evolved in tandem. Last month, Australian scientists showed that planting indigenous species in an urban green space caused insect numbers to multiply by seven times in three years. Artificial turf should be avoided.As the climate heats up, it also makes sense to choose less thirsty plants. Sometimes these are chosen as part of schemes with other environmental benefits. One example that has attracted widespread praise is the Grey to Green regeneration project in Sheffield, a mile-long flood defence area featuring a series of water-collecting rain gardens. Opened in 2020, it also provides a new link to the Castlegate area of the city.Experts as well as amateurs are changing their ways. The Guardian’s Alys Fowler wrote earlier this year about teaching herself to leave aphids and dandelions alone. Others, including Alan Titchmarsh, are more resistant to replacing scented borders with messy nature. But with almost 30% of the total urban area in Britain estimated to consist of residential gardens, what happens in these spaces matters. When so much agricultural land has become a hostile environment for wildlife, chemical-free flowerbeds can be sanctuaries. We don’t have to stop admiring double-headed peonies, which are bred to impress in such a way that bees can’t get to the pollen. But we can make more room for fauna amid the flowers."

EVs made up 7.2% of all motor vehicle sales so far this year.The number of electric vehicles sold in 2023 compared to 2022The number of electric vehicles sold in Australia in 2022 compared to 2023.“We were hopeful it would be high but this is at the top end of our expectations,” the chamber’s chief executive, Tony Weber, said on Tuesday.Behyad Jafari, the Electric Vehicle Council’s chief executive, said 2023 was the third year in a row that electric car sales had more than doubled from the previous 12 months as supply started to keep pace with demand.Australians have also had access to cheaper models under $40,000.But Jafari said the supply coming into Australia was still hampered by the fact the government had not yet legislated a fuel efficiency standard which would cap emissions across a manufacturer’s overall sales and provide an incentive for carmakers to sell low- and zero-emissions vehicles and penalise those that don’t.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe federal government in August revealed the introduction of a fuel efficiency standard had been “overwhelmingly” supported through public consultation.

        "text": "The good news is that the government has an offshore wind strategy again, something that was in doubt after the last auction flopped by producing no bids from developers. The maximum price the state is prepared to pay for a windfarm’s output for 15 years has been set at £73 a megawatt hour for the 2024 auction, a level that should be high enough to grab attention in boardrooms and spark some bidding action.The bad news, of course, is that £73 is a mighty leap from £44, the price that generated the big thumbs-down, and these subsidies end up on our bills. Yes, we all know about higher interest rates and inflation in everything from steel to the cost of transporting turbines to the North Sea. But a 66% increase?What’s more, since the £73/MWh figure is expressed in 2012 terms (a fact the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero failed to mention in its press release), we’re really talking about £100 in current money. That is roughly the current wholesale price for energy – a price dictated by dirty fossil fuels. Offshore wind’s status as a cheap technology that will outcompete its rivals, regardless of net zero virtues, has suffered a blow.UK to offer higher subsidies for offshore windfarms after crisis talksRead moreBut, before throwing up our hands in despair, a bit of nuance is needed here. First, that headline £73 figure is a maximum. The actual price will be set by competitive bidding. Alistair Phillips-Davies, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 firm SSE, one of the big players in the offshore game, said he “fully” expected the auction to clear at “a far lower price”. One hopes he’s right. He probably will be.Second, a related point: the government was in a bind of its own making. One auction flop is embarrassing; two would look like sheer incompetence. It would send a message to the offshore wind industry to erect its turbines in Germany or somewhere else. Thus setting a high theoretical maximum, while hoping the actual outcome is lower, was the only practical option.Third, if the UK is to hit its target to have 50 gigawatts of offshore capacity by 2030, a tripling from today’s levels, the government has to be prepared to take a long view and ride the bumps. The real cost-killer for developers, beyond the materials, is stop-start policy-making that ties up capital inefficiently. A show of commitment to offshore wind was essential.None of which should give the industry a free pass. The current crisis – witness the woes of Ørsted in the US and Siemens in blades – is not just financial. There is a strong sense that firms have been obsessed with pushing technological boundaries when they would have been better advised to nail down a design and then chip away at making it cheaper. But a competitive auction process, which has served the UK well since the birth of renewable energy, remains the best mechanism for sorting winners from losers. It would be no bad thing if some developers discover they are uncompetitive in today’s world and are forced to restructure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But, on a 10-year outlook, the technology still looks attractive price-wise compared with gas – even when one includes the considerable costs of hooking up projects to the grid. The shallow waters of Dogger Bank and other places remain the UK’s best resource in the decarbonisation game."

To do something that is quite unique in their history – to protect what is one of the crown jewels of British sport.Scottish ultra-marathon runner blames injury and jetlag for using car in raceRead more“It is one of the crown jewels because the everyday person is competing and running those 26.2 miles at the time as Eilish McColgan, Sir Mo Farah, and when the greatest women’s endurance race in the history of our sport is taking place.“The London Marathon is unique,” he added. “We run for clean air. That is so important in what we do. The environment is part of our DNA. And Extinction Rebellion has been very, very clear that they are in a new phase of wanting to engage the general public in a different way.”However, Brasher admitted that organisers would still be stepping up official security amid fears that other groups may cause similar disruption to that seen at the Grand National and the World Snooker Championship.Brasher is also hoping to speak to Just Stop Oil in the next 24 hours to persuade them to not to stop a race that raised £58.4m for charity last year. Not only did Just Stop Oil try to intervene in last year’s race but on Monday one of its activists sprinkled orange powder over a snooker table at the Crucible.“I have not yet had conversations with Just Stop Oil,” he said. “I’m reaching out to them – Extinction Rebellion has given me the people to talk to. It goes back to working together and I will be asking them to help and protect the marathon because of the good it does in society.”However, it would be hard to completely prevent one of the 750,000 people expected to attend Sunday’s race from causing chaos, Brasher conceded. “We do mitigate for disruption and have done so for years,” he said.Runners in fancy dress at last year’s London Marathon. Photograph: Jack Dredd/Shutterstock“Whether it was Tamil Tigers in 2009, Extinction Rebellion in 2019 or Just Stop Oil in 2022, there are numerous mitigations we put in and we do those working [with] the Metropolitan police. But it is difficult. You can have one to two people [protesting] and we have 26.2 miles.”In a statement Extinction Rebellion said: “We have been in dialogue with the marathon organisers since November to make sure we can hold both events at the same time and support one another. We have assured them that we have no intention to disrupt their event. We both acknowledge that the charities and campaigns groups that runners are supporting are unequivocally in favour of acting against climate collapse. In an emergency, as we are, we must find a way to share the London streets as we all want to support charity, but we also need to hold government to account.”Meanwhile, organisers of the Open have admitted it will be “challenging” to prevent protesters disrupting this year’s championship at Royal Liverpool but have expressed confidence in their security arrangements.The tournament’s director, Rhodri Price, said the R&A would continue to engage with protest groups before the 151st Open. The event, which runs from from 20-23 July, is set to attract 260,000 spectators – a record for an Open outside St Andrews.“We’ve seen what’s happened in the last couple of weeks,” said Price, who said the R&A has the capacity to search all bags being brought into the course. “It’s not something we are reactive to, we are very proactive. We have all of the contingency planning, a monthly security group, intelligence cells that gather all this information.“In fact, they engage with all the protest groups to try to make sure we can provide for them if they were to attend,” he added. “We’ve had several in the past that we were able to accommodate so that they can get their message across in a controlled environment.”"

        "text": "The climate emergency needs better than this. It has taken almost 30 years of climate talks for the world to call on nations to transition “away from fossil fuels” in a “just, orderly and equitable manner”. Cop28’s final text was stating the obvious but it needed saying, and not a moment too soon. Ahead of the Dubai summit, the UN said that under current policies, global temperatures were on track to rise 2.9C above pre-industrial levels – nearly double the goal cited in the climate summit final declaration.The measures agreed – to triple renewable capacity and double the rate of energy efficiency – could limit warming to the 1.5C threshold. But this relies on an equitable climate financing deal for developing countries. On this key issue, the Cop28 outcome had little to say. A report for the UN has stated that developing countries – excluding China – would need $2.4tn a year. This is a lot of money, but then what is the price of saving the planet? The US is the richest nation on Earth. It should take the lead as the globe’s largest oil and gas producer. Instead it will expand fossil fuel extraction – reckless and inexcusable behaviour given Washington’s historical responsibility.However, the economics and politics of the G7 and EU in the last decade have militated against the world coming together to solve the existential crisis. Cop28 could be a turning point. But that would need the rich world to reflect seriously in the year ahead on the state of its democratic discourse. Concerns about the erosion of public services are leading voters who rely on these services in western democracies to question the extent to which their governments care about people like them. This is fertile ground for those whipping up resistance to money being spent abroad – even if it is to save domestic voters’ lives and livelihoods.This insularity is magnified when the costs of climate crisis policies fall on household budgets. Rich world governments have the fiscal firepower to borrow to invest in greening the economy. But that has been seen as ideologically beyond the pale. The result is that many progressive parties have suffered. In the European parliament, the backlash over the costs of environmental policies may see the Greens lose a quarter of their seats in elections later this year, and benefit far-right nationalists more likely to favour fossil fuels, fewer environmental regulations and less international climate cooperation. Looming over this year’s climate talks was the spectre of Donald Trump regaining the US presidency.The developing world won’t hang around for the wealthy to get their act together. African negotiators held out for – and got – a better deal in Dubai. After years of foregrounding private investment, public finance was emphasised in the Cop outcome. It is time to hold rich nations to the words of the 1992 Rio declaration that green tech must be “in the public domain” and made accessible to developing countries “at affordable prices”. However, the overhaul in trade, finance and investment institutional mechanisms that would genuinely benefit developing nations remains a distant prospect.While the UN process continues, the world’s fate rests on a wing and a prayer. Decarbonisation inevitably requires replacing the stock of dirty machines, such as oilwells, with green ones, such as wind turbines. The UN Conference on Trade and Development estimates that 17 frontier technologies – from artificial intelligence to green hydrogen to biofuels – could create a market of more than $9.5tn by 2030. But without rewriting the current rules of the game, a few countries, notably the US, China and those in western Europe, will continue to seize most of the value. Whether innovation can drive down the cost of green technologies is important. But just as vital would be to rebalance power towards the rest of the developing world."

The typical life expectancy of such trees is 150 to 200 years.A survey in June found that 11 of 86 trees that line the route were in poor condition and required urgent attention. In addition to the six that will be cut down, leaving stumps, four will receive remedial work and the condition of another tree will be assessed.The tangle of branches was made famous by the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, which used it as a stand in for Kingsroad. Northern Ireland has used the site and other locations from the show to entice fans from around the world, with coach tours running from Dublin and Belfast airports. The County Down town of Banbridge offers a studio tour.Fans of the show and members of the public drive, walk and pose for pictures along the Dark Hedges route.The work is expected to take four days and the remaining trees are to be monitored, the department of infrastructure said. “The department will continue to engage with landowners and other stakeholders regarding their implementation of a suitable management strategy to protect the future of the other 75 trees.”Bregagh Road, which is on private land that forms part of a hotel and golf resort, will be closed to traffic and pedestrians during the work.Bob McCallion from the Save the Dark Hedges campaign group welcomed the intervention as an overdue prioritisation of safety over tourism and said failure to remove dead branches since 2016 had increased the risk of accidents.“Branches and limbs are coming down on the road even in calm weather,” he wrote in a Facebook post. “The risk factor is very high considering the concentration of visitors gathering underneath the trees.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a result, beer may become more expensive and manufacturers will have to adapt their brewing methods.Researchers forecast that hop yields in European growing regions will fall by 4-18% by 2050 if farmers do not adapt to hotter and drier weather, while the content of alpha acids in the hops, which gives beers their distinctive taste and smell, will fall by 20-31%.“Beer drinkers will definitely see the climate change, either in the price tag or the quality,” said Miroslav Trnka, a scientist at the Global Change Research Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences and co-author of the study, published in the journal Nature Communications. “That seems to be inevitable from our data.”Beer, the third-most popular drink in the world after water and tea, is made by fermenting malted grains like barley with yeast. It is usually flavoured with aromatic hops grown mostly in the middle latitudes that are sensitive to changes in light, heat and water.In recent years, demand for high-quality hops has been pushed up by a boom in craft beers with stronger flavours. But emissions of planet-heating gases are putting the plant at risk, the study found.The researchers compared the average annual yield of aroma hops during the periods 1971-1994 and 1995-2018 and found “a significant production decrease” of 0.13-0.27 tons per hectare. Celje, in Slovenia, had the greatest fall in average annual hop yield, at 19.4%.In Germany, the second-biggest hop producer in the world, average hop yields have fallen 19.1% in Spalt, 13.7% in Hallertau, and 9.5% in Tettnang, the study found.Beer-brewing in central Europe dates back thousands of years and is a cornerstone of the culture. People in the Czech Republic drink more beer than anywhere else in the world, according to a report from the Japanese beermaker Kirin. In Germany, where beer-making has been regulated for 500 years by a “purity law”, the Oktoberfest welcomes 6 million beer-drinkers from across the world into its tents each year.Oktoberfest in Munich this year, where 6 million beer lovers are welcomed annually. Photograph: Angelika Warmuth/ReutersThe taste of beer does not just depend on the hops, but it explains part of the drink’s popularity, said Trnka. “Across the pubs of Europe, the most frequent debate except weather and politics is about the … beer.”But weather and politics are both changing the taste of beers. World leaders have promised to try to stop the planet heating by more than 1.5C above preindustrial levels by the end of the century, but are pumping out too much greenhouse gas to meet that target.The study found the alpha acid content of hops, which give beer its distinct aroma, had fallen in all regions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By 2050, they found, hop yields will fall 4.1-18.4% compared with the average from 1989-2018 if no measures are taken to adapt. The projected decline will be driven mainly by hotter weather and more frequent and severe droughts.Trnka said: “Growers of hops will have to go the extra mile to make sure they will get the same quality as today, which probably will mean a need for greater investment just to keep the current level of the product.”Auernhammer said the climate threat to hops was important but added it was not the biggest factor in the price of a beer. High energy costs, driven by the soaring price of fossil gas since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have played a bigger role for brewers. “The hops inside a beer do not cost as much as the cap on top of the bottle,” he said."

        "text": "The government has been criticised for binning food waste legislation that campaigners say could have reduced food prices and helped tackle the climate crisis.The policy would have made food waste reporting mandatory for large and medium-sized businesses in England. According to research by the environmental campaign group Feedback, if it led to just a 1% reduction in food waste, food businesses would save an estimated total of at least £24.4m a year.Martin Bowman, senior policy and campaigns manager at Feedback, said this was “an immediately achievable goal” that would “more than offset the costs of measurement and reporting, saving millions of pounds, and helping struggling families by lowering food inflation”.“After a decade of failed voluntary reporting, it is a dereliction of duty for the government to abandon this policy,” he said. Campaigners say that the decision by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to backtrack on the legislation also risks exacerbating environmental challenges.Jamie Crummie, a co-founder of Too Good To Go, an app that connects customers to businesses with surplus unsold food, said: “Food waste contributes 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions, surpassing the aviation industry’s impact. As we are witnessing the devastating effect of climate change first-hand across Europe this summer, a decision like this from Defra feels particularly disheartening.”The government defended scrapping the legislation by claiming that the costs for businesses to regulate food waste reporting could drive food inflation. A Defra spokesperson said: “A regulatory approach which we estimate to cost businesses around £5.3m is not suitable in the current economic climate, especially when any additional costs may be passed on to consumers.”Instead, they have suggested expanding the government-funded waste charity Wrap’s specialist taskforce encouraging businesses to report voluntarily. However, Wrap has said there is a “disappointing” lack of voluntary reporting by businesses, and that “enhanced voluntary reporting” would be more expensive than mandatory food waste reporting.The government’s own impact assessment found that just a 0.25% reduction in food waste would balance out any costs of measuring and reporting it, with food waste measurement costing an estimated £19 for each tonne measured, compared with between £1,189 and £3,099 of savings for each tonne of food waste reduced.Last summer, the government launched a consultation regarding the proposed law, in which 99% of respondents expressed support for the law, including 79% of retailers and 73% of hospitality services.Among thoseexpressing disappointment with the scrapping of the law are the retailers Tesco, Waitrose and Ocado. Tesco has said: “Publishing food waste data is vital and must be mandatory if the UK is to achieve sustainable development goal 12.3 to halve food waste by 2030.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Mandatory food waste reporting would have played a vital role in supporting farmers to monitor and manage food waste and identify solutions to reduce it which would ultimately benefit profit margins.”The Defra spokesperson said: “We remain committed to tackling food waste and our response to our recent consultation outlines that enhancing the voluntary approach to food waste reporting is the government preference at this time.”"

In the south-west Atlantic moratorium area, Oceana found there had been no fishing conducted by Chinese fleets in the same time period in 2019. Between 1,800 and 8,500 fishing hours were detected in the zone in each of the five years to 2019. In the eastern Pacific zone, China’s fishing fleet appeared to fish only 38 hours in the year before the ban’s introduction.Image from Oceana showing the Chinese fishing activity over consecutive years in one of the moratorium areas. Photograph: Oceana“Ending squid fishing in areas where there is no fishing does nothing to protect squid,” said Oceana’s campaign director, Max Valentine.China is the largest producer of distant water fishing stock in the world, and the largest catcher of squid, according to a 2020 study. It is reportedly responsible for half of all high seas squid fishing. In the first six months of this year, China conducted more than 330,000 hours of squid fishing.“I think moratoriums are really great – it’s just like a marine protected area and stocks can rebound,” said Valentine.“Unfortunately with these particular bans, they’re not in areas where crews particularly fish. We’re not seeing [bans] off the coast of Argentina or Peru where the Chinese fleets have fished for over a decade.”Chinese authorities have said the moratorium areas are breeding grounds for squid, and bans will allow populations to rebound. However, Valentine said squid were highly migratory, and any areas purporting to protect breeding grounds would need to be much larger.In recent years China has announced a number of measures purported to control the level of fishing its fleet conducts, including announcing caps on fishing boats in Chinese waters in 2021, and in five squid fishing grounds across the Pacific and Indian oceans in 2022. Under the government’s 13th five-year plan, spanning 2016 to 2020, China aimed to reduce its fishing fleet and total catch to 10m tonnes. The 14th plan aims to stick to the 10m tonnes cap, while continuing to reduce the number of large and medium-sized vessels.However, environmental groups have expressed scepticism over the effectiveness and transparency of China’s efforts. A 2022 analysis of China’s squid fishing industry within Chinese waters found its ocean haul fell briefly from 2018 to 2019, but has since continued to rise. Under-reporting of catches in international waters and suspected acts of illegal fishing are common.Oceana analysed automatic identification system (AIS) data from Global Fishing Watch (GFW), which relies on Chinese fishing vessels having the AIS tracking turned on and operating. In recent years there have been some major incidents of fishing vessels “going dark”, including within exclusive economic zone around the ecologically sensitive Galapagos Islands.There are widespread concerns about global overfishing, and issues with existing reporting mechanisms, including in the European Union. Sustainable management of the oceans could lead to six times more food production, previous research has found, but current practices threaten to wipe out entire species.Oceana called for governments to demand increased transparency at sea and traceability of imported seafood.Additional research by Chi Hui Lin"

        "text": "Noise pollution is one of the gravest yet least recognized health threats of our time. Even moderate levels of noise – the kind that surrounds us in any urban environment – increase risks of cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, developmental delays and dementia. Now, scientists are revealing that non-humans, too, suffer from noise pollution – and that they are far more sensitive than humans.Perhaps nowhere is this more urgent than in the global oceans. Marine animals see and sense the world through sound, which travels farther underwater than light. Whales – which use sound to find prey and navigate, communicate and mate – are one well-known example. But scientists are now revealing that a vast range of marine creatures are exquisitely sensitive to sound. The range of negative effects caused by marine noise pollution is staggering: delayed development, hampered reproduction, stunted growth, distorted migration paths.Extreme noise can kill outright. A single shot from a seismic survey air-gun can kill zooplankton – the foundation of the marine food chain – up to a mile away from the detonation site. Motorboat engine noise has been found to affect fish embryos. As one study grimly noted: human noise may even be scrambling the eggs of baby fish.More remarkable still, even aquatic plants are highly sensitive to sound. Take, for example, marine seagrass. Just like terrestrial forests, seagrass is a carbon sink, contributing to stabilizing our global climate. Coasts were once abundant with seagrass meadows, which provide food and shelter for sea life, protect against erosion, enable nutrient cycling, stabilize the seafloor and filter pollutants. In the islands of the Pacific, seagrass meadows are both larder and pharmacy, hunting ground and healing space. The oldest known seagrass colony in the world (Posidoniaceae oceanica, off the Mediterranean coast of Ibiza) is over 100,000 years old, and quite possibly closer to 200,000 – which would make it the oldest living organism in the world.In the past few decades, seagrass meadows the size of the Amazon have vanished. Climate change, pollution, boat anchors and dredging, the building of seawalls and harbors, and hypersaline water from desalinization plants are all likely factors. As researchers at the Technical University of Catalonia have recently discovered, we can now add noise pollution to this list of threats. When the scientists exposed a sample of Mediterranean seagrass to seismic blast-level sound, the seagrass was severely damaged, as were the symbiotic fungi that help the plants absorb nutrients.Why would plants, without any apparent means of hearing, be sensitive to sound? Marine plants have organelles called amyloplasts, which help plants sense sound vibrations, and also store food, orient themselves to gravity and thus root themselves in the ocean floor. These tiny organelles are analogous to organelles found in octopuses and shrimp, called statocysts, which can sense even tiny sound vibrations in water. In octopuses, statocysts are grouped into lateral lines on their heads and arms. This explains how, even without ears, octopuses can locate prey or predators, particularly in low light conditions: they hear with their arms. Similarly, plants hear with their bodies.Their sensitive hearing is an advantage in the dark depths of the ocean, but it makes aquatic organisms very vulnerable. Loud underwater sounds can damage or destroy their hearing ability. These effects occur at much lower intensities of sound than are known to be damaging to terrestrial animals. By way of analogy: imagine a loud siren passing by. Now imagine that it renders you deaf; disrupts your digestion; and renders you so dizzy that you are unable to walk or tell which way is up. This is the fate of marine organisms in an increasingly noisy ocean: an onslaught of noise that stunts, harms and even kills.These findings underscore the vast threat that marine noise pollution poses to our oceans. As offshore operations – from seabed mining to oil and gas and renewable energy construction – are proliferating, little thought has been given to noise pollution. While exposure threshold levels have not yet been determined, it is clear that this emerging science will eventually lead to new restrictions on the permitting and operations of marine industrial and shipping activities.\nKaren Bakker is the director of the University of British Columbia’s Program on Water Governance and the author of The Sounds of Life: How Digital Technology is Bringing Us Closer to the Worlds of Animals and Plants\nThis article was amended on 10 January 2023. An earlier version said that sound travelled faster underwater than light. This is incorrect; sound does, however, travel farther than light underwater.\n"

However, the tanker’s cargo, of about 800,000 litres of industrial oil, has leaked, as has the fuel that was powering its engine. The oil has been detected in coastal waters near more than 60 villages, and sandy white beaches in several areas have been coated in foul-smelling sludge.The DENR said it would deploy a remotely operated vehicle to determine where the vessel is and to model the way in which oil is leaking. This process, however, will require favourable weather and currents.About 36,000 hectares (88,958 acres) of coral reef, mangroves and sea grass could be threatened by the oil spill, according to marine scientists at the University of the Philippines.The incident has also jeopardised the livelihoods of thousands of fishers, who have been forced to stay ashore because the waters are too dangerous, as well as the incomes of communities who depend on tourism.In Pola town, 14 people became ill with cramps, vomiting and dizziness after the spill, according to a report by the broadcaster ABS-CBN, which said officials were monitoring the air and water toxicity. A curfew has been imposed for people under the age of 21 in the town, and a state of calamity declared.The Oriental Mindoro governor, Humerlito Dolor, told a briefing on Monday that he would seek compensation for the damage and other expenses.“Let me assure you, the damage done directly on the environment and on our people’s livelihood will be given corresponding compensation depending on what is stipulated in the compensation guidelines,” he said.The governor was speaking at a briefing with representatives of the tanker owner, RDC Reield Marine Services, and contractors hired for the cleanup operations.The tanker’s owner has contracted two local agencies, Harbor Star Shipping Services and Malayan Towage and Salvage Corp, for the cleanup.Rodrigo Bella, vice-president of Harbor Star, said the weather conditions had made their work difficult. “If sea conditions are bad, it is also unsafe for our contractors to work,” Bella said.The two contractors would shoulder all expenses initially, including paying residents hired for cleanup jobs, Dolor said.The national government has also pledged to hire locals under a scheme to assist those whose livelihood has been affected by temporary fishing and swimming bans in affected areas."

        "text": "The government asked King Charles for permission to pass its post-Brexit “world-leading” Environment Act because laws requiring landowners to enhance conservation could affect his business interests.Environment minister Rebecca Pow wrote to the then Prince of Wales in 2019 to ask if he would accept section seven of the environment bill, which became law in November 2021.It refers to the need “to conserve the setting of land with a natural environment or natural resources or which is a place of archaeological, architectural, artistic, cultural or historic interest”. Those who breach the conservation covenant agreements could be subject to fines.When the act became law, ministers lauded it as a benefit of post-Brexit Britain. Then environment secretary George Eustace declared: “We are setting an example for the rest of the world to follow.”However, the government then missed its own legal deadline for setting what it termed as “ambitious” Environment Act targets. When they did emerge, months late, conservation charities said the targets for nature, clean air and water were underwhelming and would not deliver the promised environmental benefits by 2030.In the letters, revealed on Saturday and sent in October 2019, Pow informs Charles: “This bill contains measures on conservation covenants which affect the interests of the crown, the Duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of Cornwall. Part 7 (conservation covenants) of the bill applies to crown land as it applies to any other land.”These conservation covenants are new agreements between the government and landowners in certain biodiverse and nationally significant areas requiring the landowner not to undertake certain environmentally destructive or polluting activities.The letters show that the prince’s private secretary, Clive Alderton, responded to Pow, giving his consent for the law, confirming that he was “content with the bill”.The Duchy of Cornwall brings in about £21m a year for the duke and his family. Revenues from the estate are passed to the Prince of Wales, now Charles’s son William, who uses them to fund his public, charitable and private activities. The duchy consists of approximately 53,000 hectares (130,000 acres) of land in 23 counties, mostly in south-west England, and in many areas of natural beauty and significance that are affected by environment targets.Charles has previously interfered in government affairs when it threatened to affect his businesses. Last year, the Guardian revealed that he exploited a controversial procedure to compel ministers in John Major’s government in 1992 to secretly change a proposed law to benefit his landed estate.Under the procedure, the late Queen and her eldest son were given copies of draft laws in advance so they could examine whether the legislation affected their public powers or private assets, such as his Duchy of Cornwall estate or the privately owned estate at Sandringham. This procedure is different from the better-known royal assent – a formality that makes a bill become law.The Guardian’s Queen’s consent investigations found that procedure had been used by the late monarch in recent decades to privately lobby for changes. During her reign, ministers were required to secure approval from her or her son for more than 1,000 parliamentary acts before they were implemented. They include leasehold reform legislation that became law in 1993, when there was evidence of Charles applying pressure on elected ministers to ensure an exemption to prevent his own tenants from having the right to buy their own homes.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs declined to comment. Buckingham Palace has been contacted for comment."

That’s a major increase from the 14 such contracts signed in 2021.Fossil fuel companies won’t save us from climate change. We need governments to step up | Adam MortonRead moreWhile price volatility for gas in Europe is already easing, most of the new contracts won’t deliver gas until 2026 or later, after which they will lock in purchases for 20 years or more.“LNG terminals are massively expensive, multi-decade investments,” said Lukas Ross, a co-author of the report and program manager for Friends of the Earth. “In order for a bank or other investor to feel comfortable writing a check for something like this, they need market certainty. And the way that certainty is delivered is through long-term contracts. But a short-term supply crunch should not be solved with long-term infrastructure.”And then there’s the climate question. Taken together, the 2022 LNG contracts total 58.1m metric tons of LNG every year – that’s more than half the gas burned for cooking and heating in US homes in 2021. These contracts represent 351m metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year, equivalent to the yearly emissions of 94 coal plants or one-third of all US households.“How many of these projects are built – and how many years of extraction and emissions are locked in – is perhaps the most urgent climate policy question in the US today,” Ross said.The US government has fast-tracked the permitting process for several of the proposed LNG terminals, many of which had been stalled for years before the invasion of Ukraine. One terminal that Sempra Energy has been trying to build in Port Arthur, Texas, since 2019, for example, announced in January 2023 that it had secured contracts covering 80% of its output for the next 20 years, smoothing the path to construction.With European demand already drying up and EU leaders hesitant to sign long-term gas deals that conflict with their countries’ climate commitments, some companies are now looking to increase exports to Asian markets instead. “There’s somewhat of a bait and switch going on here,” said Alan Zibel, research director for Public Citizen. “The public have been told that these terminals and these exports are to help Europe, but in reality, the bulk of the contracting volume is still going to Asia.”Carbon capture project is ‘Band-Aid’ to greenwash $10bn LNG plant, locals sayRead moreOil and gas companies that have been trying to build export terminals on the Pacific coast for years to more easily reach customers in Asia have found a home in Mexico. Multiple projects are being built there, most of which will still go through US permitting processes because the gas they will be exporting will flow exclusively from the US.Meanwhile, US ratepayers are experiencing soaring prices at home.“The climate point is, of course, crucial and important, but this is also directly opposed to the interest of US consumers,” Zibel said.His colleague Tyson Slocum testified on this point to Congress recently. “Natural gas exports are directly responsible for Americans paying higher prices to heat and cool their homes,” Slocum said. “American households, power producers and other consumers are now forced to directly compete with their counterparts in Berlin and Beijing, which has globalized domestic benchmark prices, exposing Americans to higher prices and increased volatility. Spot benchmark natural gas prices on the west and east coast United States have been higher than prices in Ukraine.”"

Most of Cystisoma’s head is taken up by its eyes – all the better for seeing in the dark. “The bigger you make your eye, the more likely you are to catch any photons that are out there,” says Karen Osborn, research scientist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC.Q&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world’s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth – and how much there is to protect. Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A big challenge for animals living in deep midwater, in Cystisoma’s case between 200 and 900 metres down, is to see while not being seen by predators. “It’s basically like playing hide and seek on a football field,” says Osborn. “There’s nothing to duck behind.”Eyes are especially hard to hide because retinas always have to contain dark, photon-absorbing pigments, which predators can either make out in the dim twilight zone illumination, or in the beams of their own bioluminescent searchlights. Cystisoma disguises its huge eyes in a unique way. Instead of concentrating the pigments in a small area, Osborn says, they spread their retina into a thin sheet of tiny reddish dots that are too small for most animals to see.Cystisoma hides most of the rest of its body by being completely transparent. When scientists catch them in trawl nets and empty them into a bucket of seawater, they appear as empty, palm-sized gaps between other animals. “You really cannot see these things until you pick them out of the water,” says Osborn.Most of Cystisoma’s internal organs appear crystal-clear thanks to the very orderly, structured way their tissues are arranged, Osborn explains. “The only thing they can’t seem to do it very well with is their gut,” she says. The golden structure visible beneath the eyes is the digestive organ. Even this is stacked tall and straight to cast as small a shadow as possible while Cystisoma hangs in its usual horizontal position.Most of Cystisoma’s head is taken up by its enormous eyes. Photograph: KJ Osborn/SmithsonianThese crustaceans make themselves even harder to spot underwater by reducing the light that reflects off their transparent bodies, Osborn and colleagues discovered in 2016. Seen under an electron microscope, parts of Cystisoma’s exoskeleton are covered in tiny protuberances, which Osborn likens to a shag-pile carpet. Other parts are covered in a single layer of spherical shapes, which the scientists think could be colonies of an unknown form of bacteria.The nanoscopic shag-pile carpet and spheres make light 100 times more likely to pass straight through Cystisoma, rather than reflect into the eye of a passing predator. “It works in exactly the same way as an anti-reflective coating on a camera lens,” says Osborn.Discovered in the deep: the ‘Elvis worms’ that sparkle in the darknessRead moreCystisoma’s legs in particular benefit from the anti-reflection shag-pile covering and sphere-covered joints, because otherwise they would easily catch the light as they flick and wriggle about. “These guys are absolute masters of transparent camouflage out in the midwater.”But what happens when the near-invisible Cystisoma actually wants to be found? These crustaceans need to pair up to reproduce. A clue as to how mates find each other is in the male Cystisoma’s large antennae covered in structures that detect chemicals in the surrounding water. “They’re actually smelling each other,” says Osborn."

        "text": "Laws to ensure the government is transparent about how they plan to reduce harmful air pollution are among those to be scrapped in the EU retained law bill.A climbdown by ministers over the bill has reduced the number of EU regulations to be automatically removed from the statute books from 4,000 to 600, but key rules on air pollution are among those still expected to be removed.The regulations being taken out of UK law impose a duty on the government to publish a pathway to meeting tight emissions targets by 2030 for five noxious pollutants.The rules also enforce the need to publicly consult on the plans to cut emissions. But these two regulations, in the National Emission Ceilings Regulations 2018, are to be removed from UK law by the end of the year if the bill, which is going through the House of Lords, is approved.Katie Nield, a clean air lawyer for ClientEarth, said: “They are proposing to snip out some quite critical elements that are there to make sure the targets are actually met. They want to remove the legal duty on government to have a plan to reduce the emissions, to frequently revise that plan and to publish it, and they want to remove the need to put that out to public consultation.“The duty to produce a pathway to meet the targets is a critical tool to make sure the government explains what it is doing and to hold them to account. It raises major alarm bells. It is hard to see how this move could be anything other than a strategy to skirt accountability.”The government’s pathway to reduce emissions had to be revised under the regulations this year because it was in breach of emission reduction targets for fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, which is classified as a cause of cancer. The pathway is also not on track to meet emissions reduction targets by 2030 for four out of the five air pollutants from transport, agriculture and industry – nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, PM2.5, ammonia and non-methane volatile organic compounds.Air pollution poses one of the greatest environmental risks to health, according to the World Health Organization, which estimates that in 2019 outdoor air pollution caused 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide“The fact that the government will no longer have to publish its plan, revise it and consult on it in the context of their current plan not on track to meet the targets, is really concerning,” said Nield.More than half of the 600 laws set to be removed by the end of the year relate to the environment.Greener UK, a coalition of environmental groups including the RSPB, National Trust and Friends of the Earth, called on the government to remove at least two of the laws due to be chopped – relating to water and air quality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We are unequivocal that reviewing our retained EU law will not come at the expense of the UK’s already high environmental standards and environmental protections will never be downgraded.”"

I like my home comforts and, despite my husband’s previous protestations that we were not having an afterparty, one nevertheless unfolded in our living room.The photographer ventured into the garden. It was mid-April, a far nicer day than we’d dared hope for, and the tulips were out. We went on our honeymoon afterwards; had she not taken photos of them, I would have missed the lot.I enjoy a tulip. Easily identified, pleasingly reliable, come in every colour under the sun: no wonder they’ve got their own emoji. It feels as if they’ve had a particularly florid few years, encouraged, I think, by the pandemic and our desperate need for something, anything, that offered a brief hit of joy. If you were clever enough to plant some in autumn 2019, you would have enjoyed a colourful riot as lockdown set in. If, like me, you weren’t (I’d expected to have moved out of my balcony flat by then), you may have become dependent on your local florist.If you would rather have some in your garden, you may be able to buy potted tulips that are gearing up to flower over the next few weeks. It’s a quick fix but expensive, and one I’d recommend you resist so that you can spend your flower funds on bulbs come August instead, when you can order exactly what you like and in great quantity for only a few pence per bulb.It’s normal to ask a grocer or butcher where our food comes from – we should do the same with flowersTulips are best planted from November onwards (mine went in days before Christmas last year), where, in either the pots or the ground, they will gradually emerge with delicious anticipation before exploding for a few weeks. They like a sunny spot but they last longer with a little shade and will put up with more of it than people realise; they’re also very tolerant of containers as long as they’re not subjected to waterlogged soil.If you haven’t time for potted tulips, now is a good time to make a friend of your florist – especially if they grow or stock British-grown flowers. You can pick up bunches of supermarket tulips cheaply at the moment, but that’s because they are grown in water, under LED lights, rather than in the soil under daylight. Swaddled in single-use plastic, these bargain blooms lack the size, colour variation and beauty of those from more sustainable farms. A sustainably grown tulip will dwarf a supermarket one, with supermodel-leggy stems and generous, teacup-sized flowers.Dwarf irises bring colour and glamour to the start of springRead moreIt has become normal to ask our grocer or butcher where our food comes from, but we rarely do it with flowers – and we should, as they can have an equally daunting carbon footprint. But there’s also an unbeatable elegance to consciously grown, seasonal flowers. Not only are you buying them at their best, but they fade with style, too. We’ve thankfully moved away from the trend for stiff, straight stems and towards a more natural celebration of Dutch master-like opulence. When I have tulips in a vase, I enjoy them until every petal curls up and drifts towards the tabletop, their bright colours vanishing into deeper, beautiful decay."

        "text": "Seals dozing on the beach may appear to be enjoying the ultimate life of leisure. However, groundbreaking research has revealed that for most of their lives elephant seals sleep just two hours daily in a series of short naps while performing deep dives.The findings, revealed in the first study to record brain activity in a free-ranging, wild marine mammal, show that during the months they spend at sea, elephant seals rival the record for the least sleep among all mammals, currently held by African elephants. The seals were found to typically sleep in 10-minute bursts during deep, 30-minute dives, often spiralling downwards while dreaming, and occasionally lying down for a nap on the seafloor.“For years, one of the central questions about elephant seals has been when do they sleep,” said Prof Daniel Costa, a marine ecologist at the University of California Santa Cruz and senior author. “We thought they must be sleeping during what we call drift dives, when they stop swimming and slowly sink, but we really didn’t know.”Costa’s lab has been tracking elephant seals at the Año Nuevo reserve for more than 25 years, using increasingly sophisticated tags to track the movements and diving behaviour of the seals during their foraging migrations, when they head out into the north Pacific Ocean for as long as eight months.“Now we’re finally able to say they’re definitely sleeping during those dives, and we also found that they’re not sleeping very much overall compared to other mammals,” Costa added.The scientists believe that sleeping while diving allows the seals to avoid predation: they are most vulnerable to predators, including sharks and killer whales, while at the ocean surface, so they only spend a few minutes there to breath between dives.“They’re able to hold their breath for a long time, so they can go into a deep slumber on these dives deep below the surface where it’s safe,” said Jessica Kendall-Bar, the paper’s first author, who developed the system as a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz and who now works at UC San Diego.In the latest study, 13 young female seals were fitted with a neoprene headcap to secure sensors on the head that could reliably record brain waves in a scan known as an electroencephalogram or EEG. Time-depth recorders, accelerometers, and other instruments were also used to track the seals’ movements.“I spent a lot of time watching sleeping seals,” Kendall-Bar said. “Our team monitored instrumented seals to make sure they were able to reintegrate with the colony and were behaving naturally.”The recordings, collected from the seals during more than 100 dives, revealed that as they descended, seals entered a deep sleep stage known as slow-wave sleep while maintaining a controlled glide downward and then entered rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, when sleep paralysis causes them to turn upside down and drift downwards in a “sleep spiral”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In shallower waters over the continental shelf, elephant seals sometimes sleep while resting on the seafloor.“They go into slow-wave sleep and maintain their body posture for several minutes before they transition into REM sleep, when they lose postural control and turn upside down,” Kendall-Bar said.The team now plans to use similar methods to study brain activity in other species of seals, sea lions and also human free divers."

Just 6% of water users were responsible for the overdrawing of water.A review into the 2022-23 water accounts is under way.Murray-Darling Basin plan: more money or time needed to complete water buybacks, experts sayRead moreNRAR’s director of regulatory initiatives, Ian Bernard, said that while only a small number of water licence holders were responsible for the overdraw, it could have a “big impact on our water resources and can cause significant harm to industry, communities, culture and the environment”.“There’s an outdated practice whereby people treat their water accounts like bank accounts, occasionally going into the red by taking more than they’ve been allocated and simply paying it back later,” Bernard said.“That practice is against the law.”The report came as farmers, irrigators and politicians in the Murray-Darling basin region held rallies calling for an end to proposed water buy-backs.Protesters gathered in Leeton, Deniliquin and Griffith on Tuesday, supported by local councils and mayors from each shire.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nThe Edward River council mayor, Peta Betts, said the river was the lifeblood of towns across the basin.“You won’t find anyone here who doesn’t want to see a healthy river,” she said.“As locals, we can see the practicalities on the ground. There are smarter things we can do to help the river, rather than just flush more water down through buy-backs.”The National Farmers Federation president, David Jochinke, said buy-backs would reduce the value of agriculture in Australia by an estimated $855m each year.“Rather than working with local knowledge-holders, they’re trying to bulldoze through with a lazy plan that will shut down farms, destroy jobs and increase the price of food,” he said.The Griffith wheat and rice farmer Glen Andreazza said farmers in the region remembered the “terrible social and economic costs of previous water buy-backs”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Rural NetworkFree newsletterSubscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve already taken major steps in recent years – but we know there is more to do, and we have again listened to the public’s calls.“This new ban will have a huge impact to stop the pollution of billions of pieces of plastic and help to protect the natural environment for future generations.”The response to the consultation on proposals to ban commonly littered single-use plastic items in England is set to be released on Saturday. The Guardian understands plastic cutlery, plates and trays will be included in the ban.Similar bans have already been made in Scotland and Wales, while the UK government banned single-use plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds in England in 2020.However it appears the new move is not comprehensive. According to the Daily Mail, the ban will cover plastic plates, bowls and trays used for food and drink eaten at a restaurant, cafe or takeaway but not in settings such as supermarkets and shops.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It was during lockdown that one of our members had the idea of using the space on top of the car park because we know as residents it is underutilised,” said Smith, adding they were inspired by the world’s largest urban farm, which is on a rooftop in Paris.The plans include a biodiversity centre, home to a cafe and education hub that would form partnerships with local schools and colleges to promote interest in food cultivation and cooking.Urban Design Hub, which created the designs for the project, said: “The hope is that by using circular economy principles, this project can be a catalyst for reconnecting the local community to healthier and locally grown food while shifting their perception of what the built environment looks like.”The car park would also host a hub for delivering locally grown produce by cargo bike to residents, businesses and food justice groups in the Jewellery Quarter and beyond.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Most of the world’s new solar power was built in China, which installed more solar power last year than the entire world commissioned the year before, despite cutting subsidies in 2020 and 2021.Record rates of growth across Europe, the US and Brazil have put renewables on track to overtake coal as the largest source of global electricity generation by early 2025, the IEA said. By 2028, it forecasts renewable energy sources will account for more than 42% of global electricity generation.Tripling global renewable energy by the end of the decade to help cut carbon emissions is one of five main climate targets designed to prevent runaway global heating, alongside doubling energy efficiency, cutting methane emissions, transitioning away from fossil fuels, and scaling up financing for emerging and developing economies.Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said: “It’s excellent news to see the historical and spectacular growth of renewable energy.” He added that while the report shows that global renewable capacity is already on course to increase by two-and-a-half times by 2030, it is not yet expected to reach the Cop28 goal of tripling renewables.“We’re not there, but we’re not a million miles away,” Birol said. “And governments have the tools needed to close the gap.”Birol downplayed concerns that fast-rising costs facing wind developers in the US and Europe will be a drag on the industry’s long-term growth. The combination of higher interest rates and supply chain costs has forced some developers to cancel big offshore wind projects, and raised concerns over the future of the technology.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Costs will continue to come down in the industry, as the cyclical costs of today begin to ease,” Birol said.Emerging and developing economies will face challenges accessing finance, strengthening governance and creating robust regulatory frameworks which will be essential to reducing investor risk and attract investment, the IEA said, which may include establishing new targets and policies in countries where they do not exist yet.“For me, the most important challenge for the international community is rapidly scaling up financing and deployment of renewables in most emerging and developing economies, many of which are being left behind in the new energy economy. Success in meeting the tripling goal will hinge on this,” Birol said."

        "text": "About 12% of the world’s bird species have been driven to extinction by human activity, new research has found – double previous estimates.The study, published in Nature Communications on Tuesday, estimates that about 1,430 bird species have died out since the Late Pleistocene period, which started about 120,000 years ago.Known bird extinctions, identified using fossil or other records, account for about 640 species. The new estimate includes the birds that went extinct without the event being recorded – what scientists call a dark extinction.“We know we have lost iconic birds like the dodo, but we wanted to get a better estimate of the bird extinctions we didn’t know about,” said Dr Rob Cooke, an ecological modeller at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and the paper’s lead author.To calculate the number of unknown extinctions, Cooke and his team extrapolated from the 640 bird species known to be extinct using a statistical model. The model used New Zealand as the baseline for bird species loss on the basis that the country had zero unknown extinctions.“New Zealand was the benchmark, it has the most complete bird record based on found fossils and bird observations, so that is the zero point, there is nothing unobserved in New Zealand.”Using the New Zealand data, the team created an estimate of how many species might have lived on an island. They then subtracted the number of known extinctions, and the remaining living birds. The result is the number of undiscovered extinctions.The study focused on island bird populations because non-migratory birds cannot easily disperse. “Islands are the best place to study extinctions: 90% of extinctions are on islands, because island birds have nowhere else to go,” Cooke said.Deforestation, overhunting, fires and invasive species are key causes of bird species loss, Cooke said.The team’s new bird species extinction total of 1,430 may be on the low side, Cooke said. “The losses could be even higher, maybe up to 2,000, but we wanted to be conservative.”Major extinction events occurred in the 14th century, the paper found, when “the largest human-driven vertebrate extinction wave reported to date” prompted species loss in the eastern Pacific at nearly 100 times the natural extinction rate. The extinctions were driven by human settlement, which brought deforestation and the introduction of invasive species.High numbers of bird extinctions, the paper says, are a loss for “our understanding of avian species richness, ecological diversity and evolutionary history”.“The world is emptier than we realise,” Cooke said. “And these missing birds are a loss to our imagination.”Also missing are the important roles these birds would have played in the wider environment. Birds play a vital role in Earth’s ecosystems spreading seeds, pollinating plants, cleaning up carcasses and helping to fertilise coral reefs and the land with their droppings.Known bird species losses, the paper said, include “extinct megaherbivores such as the elephant birds (Aepyornithidae) of Madagascar, which influenced plant structure and diversity and ecosystem dynamics, extinct aerial predators such as Haast’s eagle (Hieraaetus moorei), and extinct seed-dispersers such as Seychelles parakeet (Psittacula wardi).”Killer kitties: cats are eating 2,000 species, including hundreds that are at riskRead moreDr Alexander Lees, a reader in biodiversity at Manchester Metropolitan University, who was not involved in the research, said: “That the study convincingly shows we have mismeasured the avian extinction crisis does not surprise me at all. Most birds have very small bones and don’t fossilise easily; many islands are not conducive to fossil formation; and in many places no one has looked for fossils at all.”The estimated bird extinction rate tallied with recent estimates of mollusc extinctions, he said, and was “a useful way of approximating the extinction crisis and understanding what we have lost”.Future extinctions, said Cooke, would continue if the world carried on as normal. Previous research by the same team of scientists suggests the world is at risk of losing another 669 to 738 bird species over the next few hundred years, with species facing increasing pressure from the climate crisis, diminished food sources and deforestation.“Recent conservation has saved some species, and we must now increase efforts to protect birds with habitat restoration led by local communities,” he said. The future for bird species “is up to us”, he added."

This would affect all sectors – farm, equine, pigs, poultry, and pets – and will have significant implications on animal health and welfare, public health, trade, and the agricultural economy,” the BVA wrote.The issue is one of several raised in a new report by the House of Lords protocol on Northern Ireland committee.“Though the Windsor framework is a clear improvement over the original protocol, it is highly complex,” said the committee chair, Michael Jay. “Businesses need clarity. The government and the European Union both need urgently to explain what the Windsor framework means in practice for businesses.”The committee examined in detail the economic, political, legal and constitutional impact of the Windsor framework. The issue over the Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland have cast a long shadow over local politics with the Democratic Unionist party boycotting a return to powersharing for the past 18 months.The framework was designed to dramatically reduce the barriers to trade that arose from the original Brexit deal sealed by David Frost in 2020. It requires businesses in Great Britain to treat Northern Ireland as if it was within the EU, meaning exports to the region had to comply with EU laws.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Also posing a problem was the sheer technical and legal complexity of the framework.The committee called on the government and the EU to do more to explain in plain English what the provisions of the framework meant in practice, and to publish a comprehensive summary including a consolidated text of the amended original protocol."

Smoked salmon pairs especially well with dill, black pepper, chives, soft cheese or creme fraiche, lemon, capers, spring greens, rye, and thinly sliced, crunchy veg (radish and cucumber, say), so bear that in mind when you come up with a dish to use up your own smoked salmon, should you be fortunate enough to have any left over. Here, I’ve made a simple smoked salmon mousse from trimmings, which can be served on crackers, as a dip for crudites or, more elaborately, in today’s cheesy gougeres.

Images show piles of goods stretching the length of its storefront in Mount Barker.In the end, it had to hire trucks to remove the goods, some of which will end up in landfill.How Australia’s op shops are caught up in the cost-of-living crisisRead moreThe society’s chief executive, Evelyn O’Loughlin, said people were donating “from the goodness of their hearts” but when donations piled up outside closed stores, they got damaged and became unusable.“Some of it is useful,” she said. “But there were also damaged goods, things we could never do anything with. Generally, the message is that people are very generous but if the shop is shut or the bin is full, keep it in your car for another day.”O’Loughlin said over the past few months Vinnies had seen a 25% surge in the number of people needing help to pay rent and bills, buy food and afford medication.At the same time sorting through many unwanted donations and transporting them cost thousands, she said.“We have to pay to get rid of them.”\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nCharitable Recycling, a national network for charitable reuse and recycling, puts the national cost at about $18m a year for waste management and disposal.O’Loughlin said Vinnies tried to “repurpose, reuse, recycle” everything, but it was not always possible. Only about 7,000 tonnes of textiles are recycled in Australia each year, and donating clothes to charity avoids them going to landfill – but not if they are stained, dirty or damaged.The chief executive of Charitable Recycling, Omer Soker, said charity shops diverted more than 1m tonnes of household goods from landfill and were “very effective in turning donations into valuable resources”.Responsible donating meant if you wouldn’t give it to a friend, don’t give it to charity, Soker said.Charity shops often experience a spike in dumping over the holiday period because people are off work and may be clearing out their homes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We can’t police it. Even when there’s a sign saying please don’t, people still do.”People should wait until the volunteers were back at work, and go into the store and meet them when they drop off their donations, she said.“Illegal dumping” was also reportedly a concern at donation bins across Melbourne, at Salvos shops in Geelong, and Lifeline shops on the Gold Coast. O’Loughlin said it was a persistent national issue.Charitable Recycling has found only 14% of donations is going to landfill, the same level as in 2016, which considering the “massive increase in consumer consumption” showed charities were “more effective and efficient at resource recovery than ever before”.The organisation is working with a consortium led by the Australian Fashion Council to launch a product stewardship scheme in March. The government-backed plan is for a “transition to a circular clothing economy” by improving clothing design, recovery, reuse and recycling.A report from the consortium found Australia’s 2,676 op shops allowed a “significant proportion” of secondhand clothing to be reused, handling and sorting more than 720m items annually.Charitable Recycling’s statistics show that Australians donate more than 1m tonnes of clothing and goods each year. The organisation urges people to consider the quality of the donation to avoid damaged or unusable goods becoming a burden for the recipients.The organisation’s advice also includes checking with shops to ensure they accept what you’re donating, not leaving items outside the bin or shop, and making sure all items are clean, undamaged and appropriately packaged."

The RSPB has already recorded sightings of oiled birds in the harbour.Poole Harbour Commissioners (PHC), the harbour regulator responsible for leading the cleanup response, said on Monday that the picture was improving, with aerial footage suggesting a 60-70% reduction in oil sightings on the water.However, the leader of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council, Philip Broadhead, expressed anger at the leak and said questions would be asked over how it occurred.“I am clearly angry and disappointed, this is the second largest natural harbour, award-winning beaches, very delicate ecosystem. The natural reaction is to be very worried,” he said. “It’s unacceptable. The operator has already said there will be an investigation … but some serious questions need to be answered.”Poole harbour oil spill has potential to cause substantive damage Read moreExtinction Rebellion led a protest in Poole Quay, with many demonstrators lifting banners reading “Perenco Out”.One protester, Richard Ecclestone, 60, said: “We are in the last-chance saloon to make changes to stop these things happening. It’s other species that are paying the costs for our mistakes. We have to respect and honour what we have around us.”Philip Evans, a Greenpeace UK climate campaigner, said: “This latest spill demonstrates the environmental devastation that comes with oil and gas drilling.”Dr Malcolm Hudson, an associate professor in environmental science at the University of Southampton, said: “While we don’t know the full extent of the leak yet, a spill in Poole harbour raises particular concerns. It’s a very large enclosed bay, and so pollutants may not be flushed out quickly by the tides. Also, it’s a very low-energy environment, so unlike a spill on an open coast there won’t be much wave action to help break down and disperse the oil. Poole harbour is especially sensitive, and internationally protected for the wildlife there.”PHC carried out a survey of the harbour on Monday morning involving 100 people, helicopters and drones. It said it was working with local authorities to monitor and clean up the spill.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Collection of oil from sightings has already commenced and is being recovered to a safe waste recovery site on the port estate,” it said.Members of the public have been urged to avoid using the water and beaches within the harbour.The leak occurred at Perenco’s Wytch Farm oilfield and processing facility, which has been in operation since 1979 and produces 14,000 barrels of oil a day.Franck Dy, the Wytch Farm general manager, said: “Any spill is an extremely serious matter and a full investigation will be launched to ascertain what happened in Poole harbour. It is important to stress that the situation is under control, with the discharge of fluids having been stopped, and the spill is being contained.”The Environment Agency is supporting the port authority in responding, including on the cleanup operation. It is understood that once that work is concluded, the agency, which is the UK’s regulator of onshore gas and oil industry, will consider whether Perenco has breached any conditions of its permits."

Today, he said, sacrifices and support needed to be focused on the fight against carbon emissions and destruction of the environment.“The world needs Indigenous people as never before,” he said. “We should be grateful to them. They teach us that the Amazon is not just a store of carbon, it is one of the great rainfall-making machines in the world. Without that, there will be more drought and worse soil. I am a farmer. I know what that means.”Murray-Philipson is the grandson of a Conservative MP and a former investment banker who opened the Brazil office for Morgan Grenfell. More recently, he worked for King Charles’s Rainforest Project, and introduced Raoni to the then prince at Clarence House. He is chair of the trustees of the environmental group Global Canopy, which also contributed to the event along with the British embassy.He has stepped up his environmental work since the pandemic, when he spent several days on a respirator and nearly died of Covid. Combined with his Christian faith and awareness of the climate risks, this experience had changed his priorities, he said. “My fund manager tells me that his job is to take me out of a mini and to put me into a Rolls-Royce.

The footage has renewed debate about the lethal shark control measures used in Queensland since the 1960s.The state uses nets and drum lines (baited fishing hooks) to catch and kill “target” shark species, including white sharks and tiger sharks, to reduce the risk of shark bites in coastal waters.

Of these, more than 400 – including nine dolphins and five turtles – died.

A similar bill has been introduced in Connecticut, and California enacted a ban on kangaroo-based products in the 1970s.The German sportswear brand Puma also stopped production of football boots made from kangaroo leather this year. The companies have joined a lineup of luxury brands such as Versace and Prada who have banned using kangaroo skin.Animal rights activists have long campaigned against commercial killing of kangaroos.“Nike’s announcement that it will end use of kangaroo skins for its athletic shoes is a seismic event in wildlife protection, and tremors will be felt all over the world, especially in Australia where the mass commercial slaughter of kangaroos occurs,” the president of the Centre for a Humane Economy, Wayne Pacelle, said in a statement.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe co-founder and director of Kangaroos Alive, Mick McIntyre, said Nike and Puma were doing the right thing.“They are saying, we don’t want to be part of this inhumane slaughter of this international icon.”He said Australia’s commercial kangaroo industry was “cruel and barbaric”.“Kangaroos aren’t farmed. Commercial killing is done in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere. The regulation of the industry is almost impossible.”But the commercial harvest of kangaroos is legal in Australia. Conservation culling of the animal still occurs, and conservation experts have previously warned that bans could result in worse outcomes for kangaroos due to overpopulation.'Like champagne, mate': how a US kangaroo ban could kill off an Indigenous opportunityRead moreThe president of the Kangaroo Industry Association of Australia, Ray Borda, said Nike’s ban was a move towards synthetic alternatives, rather than a move away from kangaroo.“It is a cyclical trend,” he said. “We have other shoe manufacturers that have increasing demand due to the environmental benefits of kangaroo leather.”The commercial industry sourced responsibly from the wild, Borda said. With one-third the carbon footprint of cattle and sheep, kangaroo products are considered by some as a sustainable option.“They emit less methane, require less water, place less pressure on grazing lands, and don’t require energy to capture and contain,” he said, also pointing to the longevity and biodegradability of kangaroo products.Borda said the commercial industry was needed to sustainably and humanely manage kangaroo numbers to ensure the species’ survival.“As kangaroo populations fluctuate in different conditions, they compete with each other and other animals for food, and put stress on agricultural land,” he said.“Without a commercial harvest, kangaroos would still need to be kept at sustainable levels through government and non-commercial culling, resulting in poorer animal welfare outcomes.”"

The submission notes the species is now restricted to a single small section of the headwaters of Tantangara Creek – an area where horses are abundant.Three other types of critically endangered galaxias and the critically endangered southern and northern Corroboree frogs are also at risk.Another species, the broad-toothed rat, which is listed as vulnerable, is being considered for an upgraded conservation status of endangered partly due to the effect of feral horses.Surveys by state governments show feral horse numbers are increasing.

The analysis also showed that chemical recycling was significantly more emissions-intensive than traditional mechanical recycling.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Binding obligations as part of a global plastics treaty – now being drafted – would play a key role, he said.Last month the federal government announced that mandatory rules would be imposed on industry to reduce packaging waste and boost recycling.Dr Deborah Lau, who leads the CSIRO’s Ending Plastic Waste mission and was not involved in the report, said the analysis “recognises that carbon emissions should not be the only environmental measure when considering alternatives to plastic products”.“Plastic pollution can have detrimental impacts to our environment, economy and wellbeing,” she said. “With plastic production and carbon emissions predicted to grow, this highlights the need for solutions to reduce plastic waste and increase circularity.“No single action alone can overcome the challenge. We need a whole of system response to tackle the issue. This includes reducing plastic consumption, developing alternatives to traditional plastic production, decarbonising energy inputs, and increasing plastic circularity.”The lead author of the report, Carbon emissions assessment of Australian plastics consumption, was Kyle O’Farrell, the director of the environmental consultancy Blue Environment.The report assessed the impacts of the five most commonly used polymers – polyethylene terephthalate, high-density polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene and polylactic acid."

And it creates jobs throughout England and Wales, boosts the economy in every community and improves everyone’s quality of life.“Commuters will have faster and cheaper journeys to work. New connections will bring new businesses to places where people need economic opportunities.

It is likely that those corals which survived bleaching have been affected by reduced growth and reproduction.”Last year’s report said three years of relatively benign conditions produced record levels of coral cover in the reef’s northern and central areas.That growth in corals was underpinned by a group of faster-growing coral species that also tend to be the most at risk from bleaching events.Dr Mike Emslie, who leads the long-term reef monitoring program at Aims, said there was an expectation the reef would have continued to recover, but the data showed otherwise.“This demonstrates that even less-severe bleaching events are enough to cause a pause in coral cover,” he said.He said the recovery in recent years was “definitely a good news story”, but this “could turn around very quickly with another mass bleaching event, and there’s still the risk from crown-of-thorns starfish and coral disease”.When corals sit in unusually warm water for too long, they seperate from algae that live inside them. The algae provide much of the corals’ nutrients, and give them their colour.An annual survey by the Australian Institute of Marine Science found a 2022 bleaching event, the fourth in seven years, caused coral loss on the Great Barrier Reef. Photograph: AIMS/Jo HurfordCorals can recover if temperatures are not too extreme, but scientists say there are also “sub-lethal” effects from bleaching.Reef experts are concerned an El Niño climate pattern could take hold this summer, further raising the risk of another mass bleaching event.Dr David Wachenfeld, the research program director at Aims, said the most recent summer had delivered mild conditions with low coral bleaching and only one cyclone.Australia is not being ‘singled out’ by Unesco’s in-danger recommendation for the Great Barrier Reef | Terry HughesRead more“However, we are only one large scale disturbance away from a rapid reversal of recent recovery,” he said.“The reef remains a wonderful, complex and beautiful system, but it is at increased risk with climate change driving more frequent and severe bleaching events, putting increasing pressure on the ecosystem’s resilience.”The report said hard coral cover in the northern section of the reef, from Cape York to Cooktown, was estimated at 35.7%, down from 36.5% in 2022.Between Cooktown and Proserpine, the reef’s central region, coral cover was estimated at 30.8%, down from 32.6% last year.In the southern region, from Proserpine to Gladstone, coral cover was at 33.8% – virtually unchanged from the previous year. In this section, some reefs suffered from disease and attacks from crown-of-thorns starfish."

She uses jam sugar, which includes pectin, to help her jam set, but my twist on it is that I’ve used honey as a sweetener instead, which adds both a wonderful, floral taste and important nutritional elements, which I think are important when it comes to sweet treats. To help set the jam, I’ve blended an entire pectin-rich lemon (including the rind and skin) into the mixture.Marrow, honey and ginger jamMarrow jam preserves an abundant crop into an economical and nourishing sweet treat. We don’t eat much jam in our house, so when I do make it, I often give it to friends and family. It makes a lovely arrival gift and feels like a generous way to share a good harvest.The translucent strands of marrow cooked into the jam give it body and an intriguing texture. Instead of using the whole lemon, you could instead use two spent lemon rinds that have already been squeezed.To sterilise the jar (or jars), wash it in very hot water, drain and lay on its side in a cold oven. Turn on the oven to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2. When the oven reaches temperature, turn it off and leave the jar in there until you want to fill it.To sterilise the lids, put them in a pan of water, bring it to a gentle boil, then turn off the heat and leave in the water until needed.Makes About 500g680g marrows (or overgrown courgettes), peeled70g fresh ginger1 organic unwaxed lemon2 x 340g jars honey, or sugarPut a saucer in the freezer.

They often dig out their homes, or setts, under relatively “quiet” train embankments, which are ideally situated away from people and also slightly raised, which prevents the sett from flooding.The Netherlands has recently reported 40 locations where the railway track is potentially compromised. In Friesland, rail network manager ProRail is building an artificial sett to tempt the protected species to a safer spot.“The area around the track is clearly an attractive environment for badgers because the embankment is made from sand, where badgers love to build their setts,” ProRail spokesperson Aldert Baas told the Guardian.“Very few people come by, which suits the shy badger, and it is often a raised part of the landscape … Friesland is as flat as a pancake.”ProRail announced this week that trains had been stopped between Den Bosch and Boxtel in the south – also affecting goods transport – because a sett under the rails at Esch means the line is unsafe.“For the second time in a week, we need to stop train traffic because badgers are digging under a railway line, which takes a lot of time to tackle because we need to get permission from the proper authorities,” announced John Voppen, ProRail’s chief executive.In Esch, volunteers from the badger work group Dassenwerkgroep Brabant are ready to assist any wounded animals if the authorities do dig up the sett. But board member Karin Derikx believes the time is not yet right.“They have waited too long,” she said. “In the winter, badgers are quieter and in the spring, they do a spring clean and dig more. That’s why there’s suddenly an alarm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Marine biologists at a Florida university say they have solved the mystery of a mass die-off of long-spined sea urchins from the US to the Caribbean.The scientists blame a microscopic, single-cell parasite for the die-off, which took hold early last year. Affected Diadema antillarum urchins lose their spines and suction, then succumb to disease.Elephant seals sleep for just two hours a day, deep dive research reveals Read moreThe researchers, from Tampa’s University of South Florida (USF), also suspect the organism, a ciliate known as philaster, may have been responsible for wiping out about 98% of sea urchins in a similar episode in the region in the 1980s.“I was like, ‘Yes, we have to figure this out,’ because in that 80s die-out, just the loss of this one species of urchin completely changed the fate of coral reefs,” Mya Breitbart, professor of biological oceanography at USF, told the Tampa Bay Times of the day she was invited to research the die-off in March last year.Breitbart and a team including scientists from Cornell University and the US Geological Survey cracked the case within four months. Their study was published last week in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances.They identified the culprit by collecting samples from 23 sites around the Caribbean, including Aruba, the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and observing organisms attached to the sea urchins, which are known as the “lawnmowers” of coral reefs for their ability to consume decay-causing algae.They were able to prove philaster was to blame by placing the organism in tanks with healthy, laboratory grown urchins and watching about 60% of the sample die with the same symptoms exhibited in the marine environment.Breitbart said what surprised them most was the speed at which they were able to home in on the prime suspect.“All of us on our team have been working on marine diseases for a long time, and this just doesn’t happen. This is really unprecedented to figure it out,” she said.The cause of the 1980s die-off was not established at the time and may never be known, Breitbart said, because no samples from that outbreak still exist.But the scientists did identify similarities between the two events, and say the outcome is the same: coral reefs clogged with algae and starved of nutrients, further adding to their precarious state.Reefs in the Caribbean were already suffering from the fast-spreading and highly contagious stony coral tissue loss disease, scientists warning more than a decade ago that the entire reef system was in danger of collapse.While there is no known method to eliminate philaster or protect sea urchins from it, Breitbart said, she was hopeful that further research would provide a breakthrough. Her team in Tampa has established a laboratory farm to study the organism, which is not harmful to humans.“We’re excited to share this information with everyone, from reef managers to additional scientists so we can explore it further and try to stop its spread,” she said."

        "text": "A deserted oil tanker described as a “floating bomb” that is currently anchored off the coast of war-torn Yemen has the potential to create an environmental disaster, according to experts.A byproduct of the battle between the Saudi-backed UN Yemen government and the Houthis, the tanker, containing over 1m barrels of oil, is said to be eroding fast, but UN officials’ plans to visit the ship this week to assess the scale of the damage have been blocked. There are fears that gases have built up in the storage tanks, which means the ship could explode.Mark Lowcock, the UN humanitarian coordinator, told the UN security council last week an inspection team had again been refused permissions by Houthis to visit the ship moored several kilometres outside the Red Sea port of Ras Isa, north of Hodeidah.The two sides in the conflict in conversation with the UN blame each other for failing to reach a solution about what to do about the ship, and its valuable cargo.The Houthis want guarantees that they will be able to control the revenues from the oil on the ship valued at $80m (£64m), a move that might require a new oil export mechanism.The UN-recognised Yemen government has warned in a letter to the UN of a “bad and deteriorating situation” that threatens an “imminent environmental and humanitarian catastrophe in the Red Sea”.It has also produced a video warning of an environmental disaster that could dwarf any previous oil spillage.Doug Weir, director of the Conflict and Environment Observatory, said the cause for concern was genuine. He told the Guardian: “Until a UN technical inspection takes place it is difficult to determine the precise risk that the vessel poses, however the potential for a serious environmental emergency is clear. An explosion leading to a spill would have a severe effect on the Red Sea marine environment, and on both biodiversity and livelihoods, an emergency made worse because the ongoing conflict would hamper efforts to control and respond to the pollution it would cause.”The ship itself, known as the Safer floating storage and offloading terminal, is a testament to a time when the Yemen economy was functioning. Owned by the Yemen oil company, Safer allows vessels to moor offshore and transfer oil extracted and processed from operations in the Marib oil field in central Yemen. The tanker contains 34 crude oil tanks of different sizes and volumes, amounting to a total capacity of around 3m barrels.In effect, a mini-oil export terminal, the ship has not been operational since March 2015 when the region fell under the control of the Houthi rebels.Built in Japan involving a single hull, experts say is likely to be at particular risk from corrosion and in spite of the production interruptions caused by the conflict, it is thought that it may still contain around 1.14m barrels of crude. The Yemen government points out this is four times the amount of oil released in the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, generally seen as as one of the worst man-made environmental disasters in history.An increasingly frustrated Lowcock told the UN security council last month “If the tanker ruptures or explodes, we could see the coastline polluted all along the Red Sea. Depending on the time of year and water currents, the spill could reach from Bab-el-Mandeb to the Suez Canal, and potentially as far as the strait of Hormuz,” he added.The unavailability of diesel fuel has meant that Safer FSO’s engines have not been started for several years, and the structure has been exposed to humidity and corrosion with little maintenance.With restricted water circulation, and delicate marine ecosystems, the Red Sea, home of corals and 600 species of fish and invertebrates, is seen as particularly vulnerable to oil pollution."

You start throwing that into doubt, [and] it becomes a lot more complicated discussion.”Sunak’s net zero U-turn is so toxic that it’s united Greens and car manufacturers against him | Caroline LucasRead moreCiting several countries that have highlighted the availability of clean power to international businesses, the former Bank governor added: “The UK was in that camp, now it’s blurred around it.”Sunak last month announced a U-turn on the government’s climate commitments, including a decision to push back a 2030 deadline for the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2035. The prime minister also kickstarted a new round of North Sea drilling, pledging to “max out” the UK’s oil and gas reserves.Carney, who as the Bank’s governor pushed to accelerate the decarbonisation of the global economy, called the decision “disappointing and mistaken”, adding: “If you make a credible forward commitment – particularly with the market and businesses looking forward – they do most of the work for you. And then it’s less of an issue.“There was very little weight, in my view, given to that decision. At least in any of the communication of that. And that’s a challenge,” he said..Pushing ahead with new oil and gas drilling risked creating a “stranded asset problem” in the UK energy sector, he warned, referring to the risk that the value of fossil fuel assets could fall rapidly.Highlighting forecasts from the International Energy Agency that global oil demand will peak this decade, Carney said: “You go back three, four years, and it was the 2030s. That’s how much things have moved. That means we are going to have the stranded asset problem in the energy sector, and it’s going to crystallise sooner than people think.”During the online event, hosted by King’s College London and the Fairness Foundation, Carney was challenged by Macpherson, who suggested Sunak’s move brought the UK into line with the EU policy on the phasing out of internal combustion engine cars.However, Carney suggested the impact on business investment would come from the government chopping and changing its position. “It has, exactly [moved in line with the EU]. But it’s moved – is the first thing. And the second, it’s a bit like – I didn’t get the chance to move the inflation target around.”00:02:22‘Dangerous and desperate’: Westminster reacts to Sunak’s net zero U-turn – videoCarney had faced heavy criticism during his time at Threadneedle Street from rightwing Conservative MPs for failing to hit the 2% target for inflation set by parliament, as well as for “mission creep” in expanding its remit to focus on decarbonisation.Arguing that it was a central priority for the Bank to spot financial risks from the transition away from fossil fuels, he told the event: “If the UK is really serious [about net zero], do you know which of your businesses are going to prosper and going to suffer under that scenario? That’s the question … you have to ask that question.”"

Its founder, Shannon Mead, said removing 1.2m butts from landfill was a realistic target for the trial.“We looked at what was feasible to collect from 80 businesses across Melbourne in just under one year as well as the funding available from Sustainability Victoria,” Mead said. “We’re aiming to go even higher if funds are available, and if that happens it could be the only commercially scalable recycling opportunity for cigarette butts in Australia.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Butts have been found in the stomachs of birds, turtles, whales and fish.Last month Guardian Australia revealed that a taskforce to reduce cigarette butt pollution promised by the former Coalition government two years ago was never established."

        "text": "Human rights groups are calling for the Kenyan government to halt forced evictions of the Indigenous Ogiek community from their ancestral land in the Rift Valley.“We are calling for an immediate cessation of ongoing demolitions and the evictions,” said Cyrus Maweu, deputy director of Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR).Long-running tensions between the community and the Kenyan government resurfaced this month when rangers from Kenya’s wildlife and forest services began forcing the Ogiek out of their homes in the Mau forest. Community leaders estimate roughly 400 houses have been demolished, leaving families displaced or seeking shelter from recent rains in makeshift structures.“We are living in absolute fear,” said Daniel Kobei, the executive director of the Ogiek Peoples’ Development Program. “The first day they started bringing down houses using axes, hammers and pangas [machetes]. They brought down the school, and on the second day they even started burning some houses. Now, they have gone back with heavy machines to bring down houses that were not completely destroyed …. They are really bringing down everything.”Community leaders fear that houses of cultural significance may be destroyed. “This kind of destruction can bring the extinction of a community,” said Kobei.The community has faced systemic evictions from the Mau forest – Kenya’s largest water tower – for decades. After a prolonged court battle between the Ogiek and the Kenyan government, the African court on Human and Peoples’ Rights found in 2017 that the Ogiek had ancestral land rights to the Mau forest and could rightfully occupy it. In a 2022 reparations judgment, the court ordered the Kenyan government to delimit, demarcate and offer the Ogiek titles to the territory they traditionally lived in.Rights groups and Ogiek leaders said the government’s implementation of the landmark judgments had been slow and left them open to continuing violations.The recent slate of Ogiek evictions in the Sasimwani and Nkareta areas of the forest follows directives by the Kenyan president, William Ruto, last month ordering security agencies to remove illegal settlers. Protecting Mau forest resources was necessary to fight the climate crisis, Ruto said, and any illegal settlers removed would be allocated land.Authorities have long maintained that evictions are necessary to protect the Mau ecosystem from heavy deforestation caused by illegal logging and the clearing of land for farming. They have also argued that the encroachment puts at risk important water resources that millions of Kenyans rely on.“The concerns are valid, but it does not mean that conservation cannot coexist with human rights,” said Maweu. “It’s about looking for a human-rights-based approach to conservation. It does not have to be exclusionary.”Some of those settled in parts of the forest have titles to land in the Mau forest, the validity of which are contested. Competing claims complicate the long-running dispute, rights groups say, and indiscriminate evictions are affecting the Ogiek communities’ land rights.Roughly 400 houses have been demolished by rangers from Kenya’s wildlife and forest services. Photograph: Courtesy of OPDPIn a statement this week, Kenya’s national rights commission said it was “perturbed” by the ongoing evictions, which were being done “without the prior profiling and identification of genuine forest dwelling communities”.Investigation launched into killings and evictions on World Bank tourism projectRead moreRights NGOs and Ogiek leaders also said that the government skipped proper eviction procedures, including giving notice to communities and resettlement plans. “The way that the evictions are being done violates Kenyan and international laws,” said Otsieno Namwaya, east Africa director at Human Rights Watch.Ogiek community leaders said the recent wave of evictions was an unexpected turnaround, after what they claimed were “promising” meetings with environmental officials this year on steps to implement the African court judgment.The Ministry of Environment did not respond to requests for comment.Rights groups have said lasting solutions to the ongoing evictions are “urgently needed”. “Unless we get to a point where the issue is sustainably resolved, it is likely to recur in the future,” said Maweu."

        "text": "A chronic shortage of observations of the vast ocean surrounding Antarctica is hindering more accurate forecasts of the consequences of the climate crisis, a meeting of 300 scientists has concluded.The Southern Ocean has an outsized influence on the Earth’s climate, absorbing masses of the extra heat and carbon dioxide caused by human activities.But at a time when the region is undergoing dramatic changes, including record low levels of sea ice, the ocean resembled a “data desert”, the scientists said.Some 300 scientists from 25 countries ended a week-long conference in Hobart on Friday organised by the Southern Ocean Observing System (Soos) – a major international science initiative working to co-ordinate and improve observations around Antarctica.Is the climate crisis finally catching up with Antarctica? Finding the answer has never been more pressing | Andrew MeijersRead moreA concluding conference statement said the Southern Ocean was undergoing “critical changes” seen in record low levels of sea-ice, record high temperatures and “dramatic” shifts in penguin populations.“The chronic lack of observations for the Southern Ocean challenges our ability to detect and assess the consequences of change,” the statement said.The sea ice around Antarctica has been at its lowest levels on record for the past two southern hemisphere summers.As the region approached the peak of winter this week, satellite data showed there was about 2.5m sq km less ice than the long term average. Scientists have said the dramatic loss of ice this winter is unprecedented.“We were completely unprepared for this and it was entirely unexpected, and that’s due to a deficit in our observing system,” said Dr Andrew Meijers, an oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey.Global climate models struggled to reproduce changes in the Southern Ocean, he said, and that was down to a lack of data.While satellites were good at recording how much ice was covering the ocean, there was very little known about the thickness of the ice or of changes beneath it.“Global warming is really ocean warming, and the Southern Ocean controls the rate of melt of the Antarctic ice sheet, which is the single greatest uncertainty in projecting future sea level rise,” he said.Antarctica’s ecosystems were strongly tied to the growth of phytoplankton and krill, which were themselves linked to the annual cycles of sea ice, Meijers said.Antarctic scientists warned earlier this month the number of extreme events on and around the continent – from the loss of sea ice to melting ice sheets and heatwaves – would almost certainly get worse as the planet continued to warm.Scientists found this year that a deep Antarctic ocean current that transports nutrients around the globe and influences the climate has slowed by about 30% since the 1990s. A separate study found the slowdown, blamed on increased melting of ice on Antarctica, was likely to intensify in coming decades.Australian climate science projects in Antarctica put on ice due to budget cutsRead moreDr Sian Henley, co-chair of Soos and a marine scientist at the University of Edinburgh, said the Southern Ocean had a “disproportionate” role in the world’s climate system.The world’s oceans have taken up about 90% of the extra heat being retained by the planet, caused mostly by humans burning fossil fuels and clearing forests. About 75% of that heat uptake happened in the Southern Ocean, Henley said.Oceans also absorb about 30% of the extra CO2 from human activities, and about 40% of that ocean uptake takes place in the Southern Ocean.Henley said: “If you look at the coverage of the global ocean, observations have increased. But the Southern Ocean is still a data desert. There’s a chronic shortage of data to address some of the most pressing questions.“It’s now crystal clear that sea ice in the Antarctic is in peril and that puts its role in the climate system also under pressure.”Also at the conference was Dr Ken Johnson, an ocean chemist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute who leads a project deploying hundreds of ocean floats with sensors measuring temperature, salinity, oxygen levels, pH and nitrate levels.“The Southern Ocean is the engine of the climate on Earth. At a time when we need to be measuring it more, we’re monitoring it less,” Johnson said.He said the number of observations from sensors on board freight ships had been declining, and thousands of kilometres of ocean often went unmonitored, particularly through the southern hemisphere winter."

But critics say the traps cause animals immense suffering, and that non-target species are regularly caught.The Welsh government’s agriculture (Wales) bill, which looks likely to pass in the next few weeks, will make the use of snares in Wales an offence carrying a potential six-month jail sentence or an unlimited fine.Late on Tuesday, members of the Senedd voted down Conservative amendments to the bill that opponents said would have have been a back door for continued use of snares.Will Morton, the League Against Cruel Sports’ head of public affairs, said: “Wales is leading the way in animal welfare by being the first country to ban these cruel and indiscriminate traps. We thank the thousands of campaigners who are backing the ban in Wales and the MSs who gave cross party support to make it become a reality.”According to 2012 research by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), up to 250,000 snares lie hidden in undergrowth of England and Wales. The wire nooses catch animals around the neck, pinning them in place.According to existing regulations, snare operators must return to check on them at least once a day, while voluntary codes of best practice recommend twice a day, particularly at dawn as most animals are caught at night.But opponents say that in practice trapped animals can suffer for hours or days, vulnerable to other animals, before they are shot or slowly die. The traps themselves can be lethal, with wire nooses that tighten the more an animal struggles to free itself.Snare operators predominantly use them to catch foxes, with a smaller number used for hunting rabbits. But Defra’s research found badgers, hares, otters, deer and even domestic dogs and cats were also often caught.Polling carried out by YouGov in January 2021 showed 78% of the Welsh public wanted snares to be made illegal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "French police have warned Alpine hikers they will be fined hundreds of euros if they pick too many blooming plants on their summer walks.Officers confiscated thousands of génépi sprigs and edelweiss flowers during a week-long enforcement operation this month.The local authorities said 20 hikers had been given verbal warnings and told they would be fined up to €750 if they broke the regulations again.While not all the mountain plants and flowers are officially protected, conservationists say the destruction of swathes of local flora is putting at risk the diversity of the natural heritage of the Savoie and the wider French Alps.François Ravier, the prefect for the south-eastern Savoie region, said: “Throughout the summer, state services maintain a strong presence at the many exceptional natural sites in the department. The preservation of biodiversity is an overriding national objective, which can be achieved through high-quality information for hikers and targeted controls.”In the Savoie there is a ban on picking blooms of protected plants including certain species of lilies, cyclamen and, in some areas, arnica. To ensure the edelweiss can “bloom and grow forever” – as in The Sound of Music – picking its flowers is outlawed.Visitors are allowed to collect génépi, an aromatic plant that is part of the sage family and can be used to produce a strong liqueur, but only up to 120 sprigs a day. Gathering daffodils, narcissi and carnations is limited to 20 stems a hiker each day.Farther north in the Vosges, authorities have banned the commercial harvesting of arnica plants – widely used by pharmaceutical companies – for a second year running due to drought in the region. The departmental council said there had been three years of low yields.“In 2023, poor flowering is primarily linked to the hot weather and the absence of rainfall for over a month. No area is suitable for picking under current harvesting rules, which require sufficient flowering density,” it said.The Vosges mountains normally provide three-quarters of France’s wild harvest of this flower, valued for its anti-inflammatory properties and used to produce capsules, oil, gel and cream.As part of an awareness campaign in the Savoie, leaflets are being distributed to remind visitors of the various restrictions in Alpine sites. Targeted checks are being carried out by agents from the national forestry office, national parks and the biodiversity office, as well as gendarmes and local police.Hapless hikers unsure of what they can or cannot pick have been advised to consult the regulations."

None of the details are solid or reliably material – fading light, mizzle, shadow – sodden earth and ditchwater sky are bridged by trees that seem to flicker out of focus.This fade to black feels more prescient for the future of trees and the living world now than it once did. For example, plans for the Shrewsbury northern relief road include the removal of many trees, including a 550-year-old veteran named Darwin’s oak, so called because Charles Darwin grew up just down the road and would have known this tree. Darwin would also have known the great Shelton oak nearby, which had a girth of 26ft, according to JG Strutt’s 1826 Sylva Britannica, but was blown down in the 1940s, its remains removed to build a road.‘Darwin’s oak’ to be felled to make way for Shrewsbury bypassRead moreImagine, around 1483 – when Richard III murdered the princes in the tower (both princes had strong Shropshire connections) – a jay took an acorn from the Shelton oak nearby, which would have been about the same age then as the Darwin oak is now, and dropped it in a hole under a nearby hedge.

Since then, 164 years later (not long in tree time) the landscape has become increasingly dominated by roads and traffic. Perhaps Shropshire’s Conservative councillors want to replace Darwin’s tree metaphor for one that suits their interests – tarmac.Fade to black. Until then, the oaks, limes and other deciduous trees flare with a visionary light in that moment of alchemical brilliance when they change into their dark, winter selves.

The proposals will be part of an amendment to the public order bill, which already includes new stop and search powers and creates an offence of “locking on” to things.So far the government has gone out of its way to characterise nonviolent civil resistance and peaceful protest as dangerous and criminal. But we are teachers, nurses, students, parents and grandparents. We act out of care, love and compassion. Now the government is going even further.

Our democracy is dead on its feet. All avenues for legitimate protest are being closed, one by one. The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act has effectively banned noisy protests. The public order bill bans “slow marching”. How are we to express our dissent? With new electoral laws on the requirement of voter ID discriminating against young people, how can those who will face the brunt of climate breakdown have a voice?The police already have adequate powers to arrest people for obstructing the highway.

Just Stop Oil supporters understand that this is irrelevant when set against the future that runaway climate breakdown entails.The government can arrest, fine or incarcerate ordinary people for making their voices heard, or it can take meaningful steps to protect the people of this country by stopping the development of new sources of oil and gas, insulating people’s homes and defending the NHS.This latest clampdown is not going to deter us: if anything, it’ll have the opposite effect.

        "text": "Your interview with Tony Juniper raises two important points about why current government policies are neither solving the housing crisis nor effectively safeguarding countryside in the green belt for future generations (England’s nature chief calls for building on green belt to solve housing crisis, 18 November).Building in harmony with nature should be supported. But the new homes being built are doing little to address the housing crisis. Targeting the countryside for expensive, executive homes is wrong and counterproductive.Around 5% of all new housing is built on land that is current or former greenfield land in the green belt. But only about 5% of this is social housing and consistently less low-cost housing overall is delivered in new developments – whether in the green belt or elsewhere – than local councils think is needed.Second, only 28% of all farmland in England’s green belts is covered by the environmental improvement schemes that Natural England administers, compared with 42% of all farmland in England. That’s why we should aim to improve the green belt through a cross-government land use strategy for England.Paul MinerHead of policy and planning, CPRE, the Countryside Charity Tony Juniper’s suggestion that “building on the green belt should be part of the UK’s answer to the housing crisis” may be right. More homes will help ease demand wherever you build them. But where we build them matters. If we construct thousands of homes in the green belt – around the peripheries of towns and cities – and don’t connect them with reliable and affordable public transport networks, then we are not encouraging people to use public transport.There are 33m cars on the road today, accounting for about 15% of the UK’s annual carbon emissions. We know that busy roads divide communities, roadside emissions cause death and disease, and car‑congested urban centres drag down wellbeing and mental health.It’s time we began reconfiguring our cities to benefit the people who live there. Birmingham unveiled its “green ring” initiative this year, and dozens of towns and cities are exploring concepts such as “walking neighbourhoods”.If we build homes on the green belt, we’re doing our towns and cities a disservice by evacuating people to the peripheries and asking them to drive everywhere. Let’s create new homes where people need them most within our urban centres, and take advantage of the public transport networks, infrastructure and amenities already in place.Tom SlaterFounding director, T2S Architecture Tony Juniper’s proposal sounds quite plausible in the way he suggests combining an improvement of urban green space with the protection of wildlife habitats. The big caveat, however, is that with a barely regulated construction industry bent on profit at any price, such a sensitive approach to development and land usage could never be delivered. Without a government that ensures land ceases to be a means of profitable speculation, taking up Juniper’s suggestion would only be a recipe for disaster. It would result in ever more shoddy housing swamping our already overstressed green spaces. Only a radical national policy to develop equitable land usage, giving equal weight to housing needs and environmental concerns could begin to address the housing crisis.John GreenLondon Tony Juniper misunderstands the fundamental purpose of green belts. They were introduced to prevent the coalescence of towns and cities, thereby avoiding the repetition of the vast conurbations that emerged at the time of the Industrial Revolution and thereafter; environmental and nature protection were secondary concerns.This is why the new towns in south-east England were developed beyond the green belt to prevent the continued urban sprawl of London, which would have solved neither housing or social problems, nor adequately protected the natural environment.Bill and Penny Boydell Painswick, Gloucestershire  Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

There’s no way we can stop pollution overnight. If there were, I would do it without hesitation.”Coffey took a veiled swipe at the Labour party, which has vowed to “end the Tory sewage scandal”, by saying that those who say they could end the problem are “either detached from reality or being definitively dishonest with the public”.Thérèse Coffey: ‘There’s no way we can stop pollution overnight.’ Photograph: Jacob King/PAShe also claimed “reaching the gold standard for ecological status would mean taking us back to the natural state of our rivers from the year 1840”, which was “not practical or desirable”. As an illustration of the difficulties, she pointed out that “no one is contemplating ripping up half of Sheffield to let the River Don run free, but without that it would never be scored as gold standard”.Her plan has been criticised for including measures such as a ban on plastic in wet wipes that were announced years ago. Meanwhile, critics say they cannot see the tough new actions needed to tackle the crisis. The environment secretary recently faced calls by campaigners and political parties to resign for “not caring” about the sewage scandal, and the Conservative party is concerned that anger over local pollution issues may cost seats in the upcoming local elections. Coffey was recently named the least popular cabinet minister – by some margin – among Tory voters in a Conservative Home poll.This week it was revealed that even England’s most celebrated beaches are being marred by sewage, with Blue Flag areas in Sussex and Devon having experienced 8,500 hours of dumping last year.‘This is bigger than potholes’: Lib Dems tap into voter anger over sewageRead moreThe strategy also focuses on getting people to use less water, encouraging the rollout of smart meters and a campaign for a change in lifestyle choices.When asked by journalists how she personally reduced her own water usage, Coffey said she had a meter that once detected a leak. The water minister, Rebecca Pow, said she had just installed her third water butt.The Liberal Democrats’ environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, said: “It’s disgraceful that Thérèse Coffey is throwing in the towel in the fight to protect our rivers from filthy sewage dumping. This is a complete abdication of duty.“The Conservatives are responsible for this sewage crisis after allowing water companies to dump sewage in our rivers for years. They need to take responsibility for fixing it. The public shouldn’t be forced to pay the price with our rivers and coasts ruined for generations to come.”Campaigners said her plans did not go far enough to protect rivers and wildlife.Matt Browne, the head of policy and advocacy at Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “What we are still waiting to see is a comprehensive plan built around delivering on a long-term target for the health of our waters and an ambitious UK chemicals strategy to weave these individual threads into a world-leading tapestry of action to restore our rivers and seas. With so much of our wildlife and waters struggling under the weight of pollution, development and overuse, only a well-focused, well-resourced and far-reaching plan will turn the tide for nature.”"

The money could come from carbon markets, wealthy governments and philanthropists, but there must also be urgent actions such as a ban on clearing forests, developing businesses that rely on standing forests and reducing demand for commodities linked to deforestation, such as palm oil, soya, beef and cocoa.Lord Turner, a former head of the CBI and ex-chair of the UK government’s Committee on Climate Change, who now chairs the Energy Transitions Commission, said governments should not delude themselves about the scale of the challenge.“As long as the world consumes more red meat, there will be an incentive to deforest more areas of tropical rainforest. If we have that $130bn coming forward, it could make a material difference. But it would not put a total or permanent stop to it. The danger would be that it would come back in future years,” Turner said.“This is an area where robust quantification of what you spend and what you get is much more difficult than anywhere else. When we work out how much to spend to decarbonise the electricity system, we can come up with a figure. [With deforestation], there is extreme uncertainty. If you really wanted to spend your way to turning off the deforestation, with a trillion a year you’d probably do it. If you’ve allocated $10bn, which is the kind of figure that comes out of the G7, don’t fool yourself,” he said.Cattle in Chaco province, Argentina … reducing demand for beef is a vital element in reversing deforestation. Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty ImagesLand use change is the second largest source of human greenhouse gas emissions, with deforestation accounting for about 15% of the total. It is also a major driver of biodiversity loss and ecosystems degradation, and has continued at a relentless pace despite scientific warnings that ecosystems such as the Amazon could soon collapse.Protecting and expanding forests is key to limiting global heating, alongside massively reducing the consumption of fossil fuels.Many leading companies buy carbon credits based on protecting rainforests, and governments are increasingly pursuing country-level agreements to prevent forest loss, such as the 2022 deal between Norway and Indonesia. But analysis has found that many rainforest offsetting projects have had little success at stopping deforestation.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"

        "text": "For the first time in 84 years, a tropical storm has made landfall in California. Hurricane Hilary, with maximum sustained winds of 130mph (210km/h) and a central air pressure of 943mb, advanced towards the Baja California peninsula this weekend as a category 4 hurricane, before weakening and arriving as a tropical storm in southern California late on Sunday.Tropical storms are less strong than hurricanes and have maximum sustained winds below 74mph, while hurricanes are at or above this speed. The last time a tropical storm made landfall in southern California was in 1939, when it flooded Los Angeles and killed nearly 100 people.Hilary triggered California’s first ever tropical storm warning, extending from the Mexican border to just north of Los Angeles amid rainfall totals estimated to have reached 70-150mm (3-6in) across southern California. This amount of rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening flooding, and would amount to more than a year’s worth of rain across parts of California and Nevada.00:01:12\"I've never seen anything like this\": Tropical Storm Hilary brings deluge to desert – videoJoe Biden announced last week that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had positional personnel and supplies to respond across the region, and the Mexican army deployed nearly 14,000 soldiers to the city of Mexicali and the states of Baja California Sur, Jalisco and Colima.Hilary will gradually weaken into a depression as it progresses north-northwestwards through California, Nevada, Oregon and Idaho during the early part of this week, although still bringing heavy rain to these parts. Central and south-west Idaho usually only have about 15mm of rainfall for August, but could receive cumulative totals of 30-50mm through the next few days.Meanwhile, large parts of the midwest and the central and southern plains of the US have been put under excessive heat warning going into this week as temperatures continue to soar 5-10C above the climatological average. Last Friday, more than 65 million people were put under these heat alerts, with many warnings extending into Friday or Saturday this week. Widespread temperatures over 38C (100F) are probable through this week but with peak temperatures reaching the low to mid-40Cs (104-112F) in places.In Europe, more heat will be moving up from northern Africa this week. Spain and Portugal will be most affected, with south-west Spain and southern Portugal seeing temperatures reaching the low 40Cs. Parts of Italy and southern France can also expect temperatures of about 40C. However, this heat should subside as low pressure brings cooler westerly winds towards this weekend.00:01:42Storm Hilary: flooding and mudslides triggered in California – video This article was amended on 22 August 2023. An error introduced during editing described Hilary as a tropical storm while travelling towards the coast. In fact, at this point in her journey, she was still a hurricane; it was only shortly before landfall that she weakened and turned into a tropical storm."

        "text": "I’m standing in a bog surrounded by plantation and grouse moor. It is overlooked in more ways than I want to know by the dystopian hulk of the RAF Fylingdales radar station. But my guide is Brian Walker, a retired maverick forester, avid naturalist and spinner of excellent tales, so the invitation to visit was irresistible.In 1974, Brian’s friend and mentor, the botanist Margaret Atherden, persuaded the Forestry Commission not to plant this area, known as May Moss. Now I’m looking at the result. With each squelching step, the hummocky expanse of brown, gold and grey resolves into ling and cross-leaved heath, bog cotton and native cranberry still bearing last year’s fruit. Beneath them are the bright green, claret and crimson colours of sphagnum mosses and, delightfully, the candy pink flowers of bog rosemary, which, along with cloudberry, occurs nowhere else on the North York Moors.A pool formed from an old peat cutting. Photograph: Amy Jane-BeerThere’s a small pool where geese nest and, in the shadow of a remnant block of spruce, a suntrap shimmers with bronzy-winged red damselflies, bees, moths and the emerald flicker of green hairstreak butterflies. Spiders attend gleaming webs. Common lizards skitter at our feet, and Brian warns me to watch for adders. A cuckoo call sounds close by – the bird appears, flying strongly in hawkish silhouette, the first I’ve seen for years.Brian points out an area of scattered pine and birch known as the radhaz (radiation hazard) because of historical radiation risk, and explains that by fencing it off, the Ministry of Defence inadvertently created the most untouched moorland heath in England. “It gives an idea what the moors could look like if burning stopped,” he says. “Trees are often considered anathema to bog restoration, but they’re spaced out, don’t grow big. That place is teeming with life and the peat is six metres deep. Imagine, seven thousand years preserved under your feet.”It’s not just the past and present of May Moss that excites Brian. Like Atherden, he thinks of the futures. “Forestry doesn’t get everything right,” he says. “But with huge areas to work with we can experiment – a bit of local disruption can supercharge an ecosystem. Scrape back here, block a watercourse there, or we can suspend planting and just step back. It might take decades to see the benefits, but fine. Foresters are used to long cycles.” Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"

But over the past 10 years, Bow has become desirable. Now, houses are worth millions and my adult children can’t afford anywhere near where they were born and raised.”There has, however, been one constant: a humongous horse chestnut right outside Bow Road station. “This tree must have been here for a very long time, possibly 150-200 years,” says Bollan, who is 55. “My husband, who was born in the flats just behind the tree, remembers it seeming just as large and imposing when he was a child more than 60 years ago.”She imagines the tree as a witness to the area’s history, a silent chronicler of the area’s fall and rise. “I wish it could tell the story of what it has seen. I hope that the tree will still be around to see the neighbourhood become more equal and less of a story of wealth living cheek by jowl with poverty.”When the leaves are full, it’s the perfect place to stop to put an umbrella up or downBy east London standards, Bow Road is very green and has many old plane trees, something Bollan felt very grateful for during lockdown. But none of them come close to this majestic horse chestnut. “It first caught my eye because of how dramatic it looked in the sunset. It’s a sentinel watching over the station,” says Bollan. “I love the way it looks in winter, the bare branches looking spectacular against the setting sun. I know spring is coming when the first little signs of leaves appear.”While Bollan, who works as a manager at the Royal College of General Practitioners, is primarily captivated by the tree’s beauty, it has practical uses, too. “When the leaves are full, it provides welcome shade to anyone waiting outside the station and it’s the perfect place to stop to put an umbrella up or down.”And while horse chestnuts and playing conkers on autumn mornings may seem unremarkable in Britain, Bollan, who grew up in rural Vermont in the US, feels the sentimental heft of the tradition. “When my son and a daughter were small, they loved finding the ‘best’ conker. There are always a few I can’t resist picking up for their colour and beauty, despite having no desire to take up conker playing.” When the children come to visit, she will still say: “Meet you at the conker tree,” and they know exactly where she means.In recent years, Tower Hamlets council has been planting new trees and Bow’s streets are now full of young alders, beeches, silver birches and hornbeams, but Bollan is adamant that her tree could never be replaced: “There’s simply something magical about it. We don’t have many things that old left, so it would be a crying shame, if it were to go.” Tell us about your favourite tree by filling in this form."

They sit outside honeybee hives and capture bees as they enter and exit. They chop up the smaller insects and feed the thoraxes to their young.The Asian hornets first came to Europe in 2004 when they were spotted in France, and it is thought they were accidentally transported in cargo from Asia. They rapidly spread across western Europe and have crossed the Channel to Britain, probably also in cargo.Once they establish permanent populations they are almost impossible to stop, so the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in the UK has launched an eradication campaign, destroying any nests and capturing individuals.Prof Juliet Osborne, the chair in applied ecology at the University of Exeter, said: “This year has certainly seen quite an increase in the number of Asian hornet nests found in the south-east of England.“It is no great surprise, because this species is spreading rapidly through Europe and can cause real damage to honeybee colonies as they predate on the bees at the entrance to hives. They also eat a wide range of other insects, so their gradual spread across Europe may well affect other wild species as well as the managed honeybee.“We have developed a method for radio-tracking the hornets so that they can be followed back to their nest to help with control efforts. We are also working on an automated monitor, using artificial intelligence to detect and identify Asian hornets in the future, making it much easier to monitor their spread.”Defra’s chief plant and bee health officer, Nicola Spence, said: “By ensuring we are alerted to possible sightings as early as possible, we can take swift and effective action to stamp out the threat posed by Asian hornets. That’s why we are working at speed to locate and investigate any sightings in Folkestone as Asian hornets have been confirmed in the area.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Fruit growers in the UK are already seeing less yield and lower-quality produce because of the loss of insects, scientists have told MPs, warning that a further loss of pollinators could have “significant” impacts on all crops.As part of a parliamentary inquiry into insect decline and UK food security, Prof Simon Potts from the University of Reading told MPs at the science, innovation and technology committee that there is already good evidence of a shortfall of pollinators and a threat to food production.He said: “That shortfall translates not only into less yield but also lower-quality produce … With poor pollination, you’re getting a shortfall in the production of nutrients, and for the farmers of course that translates into loss of profit.”Focusing on interpreting insect-decline data, Potts’ contribution referenced a study that shows a deficit in pollination for the UK’s gala apples could equate to £5.7m in loss of production. This, he said, could be fixed with interventions to boost pollinators.The study notes that bees and hoverflies are the main pollinators of apples, and are “essential” for global production of apples, one of the world’s most important fruit crops. The study says “direct links between insect pollination and apple quality are equivocal”, with specific mention of the number of seeds, size (which affects their marketability) and calcium levels.Potts said there was minimal data on pollinator trends in the countries from where the UK imports many of its fruits and vegetables. “We’ve got a challenge at home, absolutely ... but we have almost no data on the status and trends of pollinators and other beneficial insects in those countries that produce a huge amount of fruit and veg that comes to the UK. That, in terms of policy and practice, is a huge challenge.”He added: “Many of our crops – mangoes, raspberries, strawberries – are coming in from north Africa, Europe or South America. We are quite vulnerable, not only at home but also overseas.”Insect pollination contributes more than £600m to the UK economy every year. More than 75% of all food crops require pollination, and declines have serious implications for global food security. The drivers of insect loss vary, but almost certainly include loss of habitat (driven by the expansion of agricultural land), exposure to pesticides and climate breakdown.Research published this week revealed that conservation measures over the past 30 years have failed to stop the decline of insects on British farmland. Potts encouraged MPs to push for a new biodiverse and sustainable farming system, which he said could be be done through farming policy by way of environment land management schemes, as well as local nature recovery strategies and biodiversity net gain (BNG), both of which could include policies around insects.Prof Dave Goulson from the University of Sussex, who was giving evidence alongside Potts, said: “Insects are quite adaptable, and they’ve been around for 480m years and survived all the mass extinction events that have gone before. But, simultaneously, if their home is destroyed, there’s nowhere to nest, they can’t find anything to eat … When you put it all together, then we shouldn’t really be surprised that they’re struggling to cope.”More wildlife-friendly farming needed to stop decline of insects in Britain, says reportRead moreHe reiterated the need to improve the way we farm. “Seventy per cent of Britain, roughly, is farmland, and there is pretty clear evidence that the way farming has changed is the biggest driver of biodiversity declines. So moving towards a more sustainable approach to food production seems to me vital.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"

Many women begin working as porters and are at risk of trafficking, sexual exploitation and debt bondage – a form of modern slavery in which workers are trapped in work and exploited to pay off a huge debt.Children working in an aluminium pot factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Up to 85 million children work in hazardous jobs around the world. Photograph: NurPhoto/GettyOne woman, who migrated to Accra from northern Ghana, used to farm until the land was ruined by flooding and she was forced to move. For seven years she has worked as a porter (kayayie), carrying items on her head.She said: “Working as a kayayie has not been easy for me. When I came here, I did not know anything about the work. I was told that the woman providing our pans will also feed us and give us accommodation. However, all my earnings go to her and only sometimes will she give me a small part of the money I’ve earned.”She dropped a customer’s items once and had to pay for the damage, which she could not afford. The woman in charge paid up on condition that she repay her. She added: “I have been working endlessly and have not been able to repay.”A woman from the Sundarbans in Bangladesh, who moved to Kolkata after a cyclone to support her family. Now she cannot return to home without her employer’s permission. Photograph: Somnath HazraIn the Sundarbans, on the border between India and Bangladesh, severe cyclones have caused flooding in the delta, reducing the land available for farming. With countries in the region tightening immigration restrictions, researchers found that smugglers and traffickers operating in the disaster-prone region were targeting widows and men desperate to cross the border to India to find employment and income. Trafficking victims were often forced into hard labour and prostitution, with some working in sweatshops along the border.Fran Witt, a climate change and modern slavery adviser at Anti-Slavery International, said: “Our research shows the domino effect of climate change on millions of people’s lives. Extreme weather events contribute to environmental destruction, forcing people to leave their homes and leaving them vulnerable to trafficking, exploitation and slavery.”The World Bank estimates that, by 2050, the impact of the climate crisis, such as poor crop yields, a lack of water and rising sea levels, will force more than 216 million people across six regions, including sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia and Latin America, from their homes.Climate disasters ‘caused more internal displacement than war’ in 2020Read moreThe report is a stark warning to world leaders in advance of the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow in November and calls on them to make sure efforts to address the climate emergency also tackle modern slavery. The report says labour and migrant rights abuses are disregardedin the interests of rapid economic growth and development.Ritu Bharadwaj, a researcher for the IIED, said: “The world cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the forced labour, modern slavery and human trafficking that’s being fuelled by climate change. Addressing these issues needs to be part and parcel of global plans to tackle climate change.”"

        "text": "The River Ouse is on course to be the first river in England to be granted legal rights, as part of a growing movement to bolster protection for nature through the law.Lewes district council passed a rights of river motion acknowledging the rights of nature as a way of improving the health of local rivers by giving them similar protection to people, and agreed there was “a case to be made for considering our interactions with our local waterways”.A charter on the river’s rights is now being developed, which will be sent to the council to endorse within the next two years. This is likely to be based on the Universal Declaration of River Rights, which says rivers should have the right to flow, perform essential functions within the river’s ecosystem, be free from pollution, feed and be fed by sustainable aquifers and have native biodiversity, as well as the right to regeneration and restoration.The Ouse, like many other rivers around the country, gets filled with effluent and wastewater when sewage treatment plants along its route cannot cope with heavy rain. In 2019, every river in England failed to meet quality tests for pollution.The move to grant the River Ouse rights was spearheaded by Matthew Bird, a Lewes town and district councillor. He told the Guardian he had become increasingly frustrated with the framing of discourse around water pollution. “The water companies are not taking their responsibilities seriously; there’s a policy vacuum at government level, and the Environment Agency, who are the river’s legal protectors, are not protecting it. At the same time, local communities feel powerless and vent frustrations in protest or take part in sporadic orchestrated meetings with Southern Water with no action followed up.”Laws of nature: could UK rivers be given the same rights as people?Read moreThe council had already passed two earlier motions highlighting clear evidence that water quality had deteriorated due to sewage pollution and recognising its obligation to protect local rivers. Bird said this was a response to growing public concerns for the health and wellbeing of water bodies and a determination to hold companies to account.Attempts to give part of the River Frome in Somerset legal rights failed in 2020, prompting Bird to seek a new approach. After a mapping exercise held during a popular river festival, and with support from the Environmental Law Foundation and other experts, he drafted a motion he hoped would bring the whole community and a neighbouring local authority on board.Despite initial opposition, Bird said an “impassioned speech” by a Conservative councillor in favour of the motion convinced most to vote for it. “That was quite amazing, and good to think that feelings towards the river can be stronger than politics,” he said.Work on the charter will involve local people and environmental groups and will be discussed at the next catchment partnership meeting of organisations involved in protecting the water environment. Bird said there are still many unanswered questions about how the rights will work in practice. “But that’s fine. We have two years to work out an answer,” he said.The motion was supported by local organisations including the Ouse and Adur Rivers Trust and the Sussex Wildlife Trust.Laws giving natural features such as rivers and mountains, or ecosystems, legal rights have been enacted around the world, from Ecuador to New Zealand.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"

        "text": "Rishi Sunak’s Friday morning was probably ruined by the furious resignation letter he received from Zac Goldsmith, in which the Tory peer accused the prime minister of being apathetic about the environment and a failure on climate policy. But was Goldsmith right?It appears so. While it would be difficult to accuse Sunak of being a climate denier, the evidence suggests he does not care about the subject, which has resulted in a lack of climate action and risks the UK helping push the planet towards an uninhabitable condition.Though the prime minister is always keen to regale audiences with how his young daughters are champions for the environment, he is certainly not one. When he was chancellor, ministers in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Foreign Office frequently described him as a “block” on funding for climate and nature, and said that at the cabinet table he argued for trade deals with countries that had lower environmental standards, rather than using Britain’s power on the world stage to push for change.Critics are keen to point out Sunak refused to sign a foreword to the Dasgupta report, a review of the value of biodiversity. This review, by the respected professor Sir Partha Dasgupta, was welcomed across the board, even by the former chancellor Sajid Javid, despite Sunak appearing unimpressed by its findings.Still, people can learn, and in his role as prime minister Sunak has had access to all the best experts and evidence available on climate. He was given a major opportunity to stand on the world stage as the UK’s new prime minister at the UN’s Cop27 climate summit last year, but he flip-flopped on attending, and only flew out to Egypt at the last minute, giving the audience a policy-free speech about how his children care about the environment.Since then, things have gone downhill. His government failed to include environmental protections in the retained EU law bill, which will scrap many EU regulations that protect the environment in the UK. Sunak’s government has also committed to extracting more polluting fossil fuels, from the Cumbria coalmine to the Rosebank oilfield.And under his leadership, the energy department has spent far more time attacking the Labour party for taking donations from a funder of the protest group Just Stop Oil than it has championing the net zero by 2050 target enshrined in law by Sunak’s predecessors.Just look at this week’s Climate change committee report. The UK was not perfect on climate policy under Boris Johnson, but the committee, chaired by a Conservative MP, found the country had regressed further over the past year.It said the country had failed on insulation, with fewer homes protected under government-backed schemes than last year; that there had been little progress on transport emissions; there was no programme for behaviour change; and wind and solar farms were being installed at a snail’s pace. The committee specifically blamed a failure of political leadership for the stalled progress.Lord Deben, the outgoing chair of the committee, said its confidence that the government would meet its shorter-term carbon-cutting goals by 2030 was even lower than last year, despite the publication of a new green strategy by ministers. “We’ve slipped behind, and other people have moved ahead,” he said. “This is not a report that suggests satisfactory progress.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Although he got a dog for his daughters and takes it on the occasional photo opportunity, he allowed the Defra minister Mark Spencer, who is cosy with the farming and hunting lobbies, to scrap the kept animals bill, a decision that Labour and the Lib Dems are looking to exploit and which is likely to allow animal cruelty to continue for years to come.In his resignation letter, Goldsmith wrote: “The problem is not that the government is hostile to the environment, it is that you, our prime minister, are simply uninterested.” It is hard to disagree. Unless Sunak has a swift and significant change of heart, he is likely to be remembered for allowing the UK to lose its role at the forefront of the climate fight."

        "text": "Deforestation has a far greater impact on regional temperatures than previously believed, according to a new study of the Brazilian Amazon that shows agricultural businesses would be among the biggest beneficiaries of forest conservation.The research has important political implications because farmers in Amazonian states have, until now, led the way in forest destruction on the assumption that they will make money by clearing more land.The new research highlights the other side of the picture. It shows the agricultural heartland of Mato Grosso, where crops are already suffering from drought and extreme heat, would be just over half a degree celsius hotter by 2050 if deforestation continued at the rapid rate of recent years.The paper, published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrated Amazon deforestation causes warming at distances up to 60 miles (100km) away. The greater the forest clearance, the higher the temperature. This is in addition to the wider climate impact of global heating.‘Our world hangs by a thread’: Indigenous activist asks US agri giant to stop destroying Amazon rainforestRead moreDominick Spracklen of the University of Leeds said the average tree had a cooling effect equivalent to two to three 2.5kW air conditioners working at full power every hour of every day. This works through evapotranspiration, which he said was very similar to the sweat humans produce to lower body temperature. He said the effect spread wider than anyone had realised.“We always thought this might be happening, but the extent is bigger than I would have thought,” he said. “More and more, we are demonstrating the big benefits the forests bring to surrounding regions. For farmers, they bring cooler air and more rainfall. Hopefully putting numbers on these benefits will help to persuade a broader set of people to protect forest areas.”An increasing number of peer-reviewed studies are proving the importance of the Amazon in maintaining a stable regional climate. Earlier this year, a paper showed that forest clearance reduced rainfall up to 125 miles away. More recently, research at a greater scale demonstrated that the Amazon was coupled with the South American monsoon and that continued deforestation could reduce regional precipitation by 30% with dire consequences for food production.Until now, studies on the impact of forest clearance on heat have concentrated on local effects with a clear correlation between loss of tree cover and higher temperatures in the area where the trees were cut down. The new research went further by looking at whether there is also a warming effect over a wider area. Using satellite data and artificial intelligence, the authors found a 0.7C increase in temperature for each 10-percentage point loss of forest within a radius of 60 miles.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

As the paper concludes: “We show that regional forest loss increases warming by more than a factor of four with serious consequences for the remaining Amazon forest and the people living there.”However, the lead author, Ed Butt, said this should be seen not as an alarm, but as a useful tool to incentivise the sustainable management of the forest. ”If we could reduce deforestation, then we could avert a good amount of regional warming. I see that as a big opportunity. It demonstrates the big benefit of reducing deforestation for local farmers … The most important thing is that states like Mato Grosso can follow different futures. This hands back control to regions and states. They could really reduce the amount of warming they will be exposed to.”"

The government has the power to stop this huge waste of police time and resources immediately, by ending new oil and gas. The money would be far better spent on protecting the British public by leading a rapid transition away from deadly fossil fuels.”MPs are to debate a statutory instrument to amend the meaning of “serious disruption” in the UK’s public order regime, lowering its threshold from “significant” or “prolonged” disruption to “more than minor”.Despite a host of new powers conferred by the recent Public Order Act 2023, police have so far used longstanding public order powers to tackle the go-slow marches. “In a lot of cases, putting in conditions from section 12 of the Public Order Act [1986] has encouraged protesters to exit the highway within minutes,” the force said.On Monday morning, Just Stop Oil’s supporters were on the streets once again, beginning what the campaign said was the eighth week of daily protests.

Eighty-six arrests had been made over the campaign, mostly for breaching these orders, the Met said. Supporters of Just Stop Oil had been charged 49 times.Sometimes officers have also arrested passersby or drivers caught behind marches who have confronted and attacked protesters. Adelekan said: “We know this action has been very frustrating for the public who just want to carry on with their day-to-day business. We would urge the public not to intervene or take matters into their own hands but to call the police, let us know where the incident is and we will get to the scene quickly. It may look like we are not responding quickly enough, however policing protests is complex and there are steps officers must take to make sure our response is lawful and appropriate.”"

Without those positions being filled, the government will not be able to meet its climate goals of increasing woodland cover.The government has promised to increase England’s woodland cover from 14.5% to 16.5% by 2050, and tree-planting across the UK to 30,000 hectares a year by the end of parliament.The courses will cost £700,000, allocated from the £750m Nature for Climate Fund.The government hopes the courses will prompt people to consider a career in forestry, so the sector can grow and woodland goals can be met. Ministers said it could also create new green jobs and boost the economy.The forestry minister, Trudy Harrison, said: “We need to continue the legacy of our skilled forestry workforce to increase tree-planting across the country. More woodland is vital for nature’s recovery and also essential to increase our security of UK grown timber, and deliver on our net-zero commitments.“We have many fantastic foresters already, but there aren’t enough to grow and manage our woodlands at the planned scale over the coming decades.“Our free practical forestry training courses will create green jobs, bring more people into the forestry sector and help existing workers build on and diversify existing forestry skills to meet this demand.”The government is offering 100% funding for eligible courses and expects grants to range between £150 and £3,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Hedgerows in England are under threat, farmers and nature groups have warned, as the government prepares to cut funding that protects them.Hedges are vital habitat for many species, providing food and shelter for mammals, birds and pollinators, with the EU paying farmers under its farming subsidy scheme to have them on their land.But in the transition to post-Brexit farming payments, which are aimed at paying land managers to protect and conserve nature, a scheme that encouraged the laying and maintenance of hedges, could be lost.To qualify for the basic payments scheme (BPS), which paid land managers per hectare, they had to meet standards including decreeing that farmers did not plough to the base of hedgerows, thus damaging roots, or use fertilisers or pesticides within 2 metres of them. The rules also stated that hedgerows were not cut between 1 March and 31 August without good cause, because this is when birds nest in them.In advance of these payments being phased out – farmers are getting less of the BPS money every year and instead have the chance to “top up” with new environmental land-management payments – the government is dropping all these requirements at the end of the year.The RSPB has called for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to keep the hedge protections, or replace them with another hedge-protecting policy.Alice Groom, the head of sustainable land use policy at the charity, said: “The future of over 547,000km of hedgerow alongside agricultural land is now under threat. As spaces for wildlife we believe hedgerows are an essential part of creating a vibrant countryside and should be recognised as part of the effort to halt species decline in England, as well as helping to keep carbon locked up.“So we are asking Defra to commit to the protection of our precious hedgerows and ensure that they continue to have the basic protections as afforded under the basic payments scheme.”Other charities have criticised the lack of care for hedges. Tom Fyans, the director of campaigns and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, said: “It’s simply not good enough. The anger levels of farmers and land managers trying their best to look after our environment are rising fast because the government is increasingly seen as a hindrance rather than a help.“Defra has been widely criticised for its lack of ambition when it comes to protections for nature. Worse, it now looks like even the insufficient protections we do have are going to be lost through sheer carelessness.“There was genuine goodwill back in January when the government announced plans to plant 30,000 miles of new hedgerows. Ministers are in danger of squandering this positive momentum because, despite setting hedgerow targets, there is so far no policy that might actually ensure they are hit.“Now we find out one of the few protections hedgerows do enjoy is about to become null and void.”Farmers have also complained and urged the government to act.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Hedgerows bring numerous benefits, from carbon sequestration and natural pest control to flood mitigation, but they are also a part of our countryside’s heritage.UK fruit exports to EU have dropped by more than half since BrexitRead more“Removing basic hedgerow protections runs counter to the need to secure ecosystem functionality in ways that improve farming’s resilience. A move to a system of public money for public goods will only be successful if it’s underpinned by a clear regulatory baseline that protects the natural assets that our food production relies upon.”A Defra spokesperson said: “Hedgerows are an important ecological building block in our landscapes – maintaining the distinctive character of our countryside, improving local air quality, and providing crucial habitats for wildlife. Our countryside stewardship schemes are already helping farmers maintain and restore over 10,000km of existing hedgerow and plant an additional 4,000km of hedges right across the country.“We are also introducing a new sustainable farming initiative hedgerow standard this year to pay farmers to assess the condition of hedgerows and manage them in a way that will work for wildlife and improve biodiversity. And we will shortly be consulting on how to best further protect them as we phase out the [EU] common agricultural policy.”"

A separate source said that Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, which is owned by Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ, could be a good fit for the project.The UAE interest comes against the backdrop of Westminster tensions over a separate Emirati deal. Last week, RedBird IMI – a joint-venture between America’s Redbird Capital and International Media Investments, an Abu Dhabi investor also backed by Mansour – announced a deal to take control of the Telegraph group. The government has indicated it will launch a public interest investigation into the newspaper deal.The Sizewell C plant aims to generate enough energy to power 6m homes. It is backed by France’s EDF and the UK government, which has spent nearly £100m buying CGN out of the project. CGN had held a 20% stake.Rishi Sunak hosted Mubadala’s Khaldoon Al Mubarak at a meeting of global business leaders at Hampton Court, south-west London, on Monday as he attempts to attract foreign investment to the UK.Although a formal search for outside investment launched in September, Sizewell C has been touted to potential investors – including sovereign wealth funds, infrastructure and pension funds – for years. The government earmarked a further £341m to develop the project in August.Bankers at Barclays have been tasked with procuring investment for the project, which has faced significant opposition in Suffolk.The interest from the UAE – host of Cop28, which begins this week – in Sizewell C has been mooted for more than a year. Last week, campaigners parked a sign reading “Sizewell C is a toxic investment” outside the UAE embassy in London.Alison Downes, of the Stop Sizewell C campaign, said: “There may be a dearth of UK interest in Sizewell C, but there is no energy security in handing chunks of the UK’s critical national assets to countries that don’t share our values. If the UAE is not good enough for the Telegraph, it’s definitely not good enough for Sizewell C.”Investors in Saudi Arabia and Australia have also previously reportedly been approached to back Sizewell C. However, a source close to the project denied there was active interest from Saudi investors.Last year, the Observer revealed that the British Gas owner Centrica – a minority investor in Britain’s nuclear power stations – was interested. Greencoat Capital, the investment firm, has also expressed an interest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Backers are seeking a development consent order that will precede a final investment decision by its backers.The plant is not expected to generate power until at least the mid-2030s, after most of Britain’s nuclear power stations have been retired.Sunak’s government hopes to kickstart a renaissance in the nuclear power industry, and launched a new delivery body, Great British Energy, in the summer.Separately, the boss of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, is expected to urge the government to back its plans to build small nuclear power plants at an investor day on Tuesday.Sizewell C and Mubadala have been approached for comment."

Previous analysis has shown that 24-hour PM2.5 levels exceeded the Australian air quality standard of 25 micrograms a cubic metre in parts of the town of Morwell on 23 of those days, sometimes reaching levels 19 times the limit.The research, published in the journal Environmental Research, compared the hospital records of 2,725 Latrobe Valley residents from 2009 to 2019 against data about their smoke exposure during the mine fire.The study’s corresponding author, Yuming Guo, a professor of global environmental health and biostatistics at Monash University, said: “[With] just six weeks’ exposure to the coalmine fire smoke, there were long-term effects for human health.”The Hazelwood research showed that the particulate matter in coalmine smoke was of higher health risk than other sources of PM2.5, he said.“Because both coalmine fire and wildfire smoke have a higher concentration than background PM2.5, the issues … are very serious for the general population and also for vulnerable people [such as pregnant women, elderly people, or those with pre-existing health conditions].”Guo said governments and communities would need to do more to prepare for future fires, given that amid the climate emergency bushfires are beginning earlier and the intensity of fire weather is increasing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Farmer, whose husband worked in the Hazelwood mine before it closed in 2017, said: “Many of the workers and the emergency services of course did not reside in Morwell.“I think there is a high percentage of the community that are still suffering from respiratory and heart disease that aren’t covered in this study.”"

I didn’t know exactly what, and definitely couldn’t have named which oil and gas licences he wanted to issue, but I knew that, whatever it was, it would spell the end of our commitment to net zero. I figured it would shift our international alignment away from the countries taking the climate crisis seriously, because it’s right in front of them and they are not psychopaths, towards the countries strutting their indifference to it, for the complicated but demonstrable political mileage in the message: “Follow me to hell – it’ll be fun there.”It was written right there in his holiday house. Why would a British prime minister have a second home in California? It’s such a forceful statement – I don’t care how rich I look, I don’t care how much I fly, I don’t care what eco-nerds think – and so unforced. He could have sold it, waited till he was no longer the prime minister – he must have known it wouldn’t be for ever – and bought a bigger one.Once you are looking through that lens – that he sees environmentalism as dross to be jeered at – the man makes a lot more sense. When he says he is anti-woke, he probably means it. When he waves through sadistic policies on asylum seekers, he isn’t being regrettably outflanked by ministers to his right, he is enjoying it.It’s possible that this guy, steering our sorry country in its hard-right direction, is actually quite rightwing.

He came off like a technocrat, a smooth and reasonable man, not especially ideological in any direction. He self‑presents like the Macron of the right: maybe he doesn’t actively care about your predicament, perhaps he would always put his own first; yes, he spent enough money on sliders and coffee-warmers to mark himself out as a pretty unserious person, but he camouflaged himself effortlessly as practical, unencumbered by anything as unwieldy as a big idea. He absolutely did not read as a man with enough programmatic self‑belief to drive us all off a cliff. He seemed like a respecter of cliffs.This magnificent misdirection was only possible because we had had too many prime ministers in too short a time.

        "text": "The owner of the Drax power plant has been forced to deny that it used a loophole in the government’s subsidy scheme to avoid paying almost £650m to households since the start of the energy crisis.An investigation by Bloomberg found that the FTSE 100 company idled one of the generating units at its giant North Yorkshire power plant for much of 2022 when the energy market crisis plunged millions of homes into fuel poverty.The report claims that if Drax had kept running the unit, which earns a fixed subsidy levied on energy bills, it would have been required to return an estimated £639m to bill payers as of last month.Instead the FTSE 100 company was able to use a surge in the global price for wood pellets to make more money from selling them on than it could by using them to generate electricity, according to Bloomberg.Although Drax is not alleged to have broken any market rules, a previous energy minister accused the company of acting against the national interest. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, who was energy secretary when the government negotiated the subsidy deal, said: “It looks like they are acting in bad faith.”Under the terms of the subsidy contract, which has handed Drax about £1.4bn to date, energy projects receive a fixed price for each megawatt of electricity generated.Usually companies receive a payment levied on energy bills which tops up the earnings from the wholesale market to the agreed “strike price”. But in the past year market prices have been significantly higher than the subsidy level, requiring companies to pay the difference back to consumers.Drax has denied that it intentionally shut its biomass unit to avoid making these payments in favour of profiting from the resale price of its wood pellets, branding Bloomberg’s investigation “false, inaccurate, and misleading”.The company said the surging price of biomass had made the generating unit “uneconomical” to run at the agreed subsidy level, which assumed the average cost of biomass would be about $181 a tonne. In 2022 the price reached a peak of $467 a tonne.A Drax spokesperson said: “The Russians’ invasion [of Ukraine] created unprecedented challenges to the electricity market due to constrained fuel supplies, leading to an increase in both the demand for biomass and the price of pellets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The authors advise that world needs to:\nRetire about 240 average-sized coal-fired power plants a year, every year between now and 2030.\nConstruct the equivalent of three New Yorks’ worth of public transport systems in cities around the world each year this decade.\nHalt deforestation, which is happening to an area the size of 15 football pitches every minute, this decade.\nIncrease the rate of growth of solar and wind power from its current high of 14% a year to 24% a year.\nCut meat consumption from ruminants such as cows and sheep to about two servings a week in the US, Europe and other high-consuming countries by 2030.\nThe prospect of staying within 1.5C will slip away altogether without drastic action, the authors warned. Sophie Boehm, research associate at the World Resources Institute and lead author of the report, said: “Global efforts to limit warming to 1.5C are lacklustre at best. Despite decades of dire warnings and wake-up calls, our leaders have largely failed to mobilise climate action anywhere near the pace and scale needed.

Instead, we need immediate, transformational changes across every single sector this decade.”Public funding of fossil fuels continues, despite countries’ commitments made two years ago in Glasgow at Cop26, to limit global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. Many countries are also still expanding their fossil fuel production: for instance, in the UK, the government last week announced new annual licensing rounds for exploration projects in the North Sea.Countries including the UK are also increasing subsidies and tax breaks for fossil fuels. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, government financing for fossil fuels increased sharply: subsidies almost doubled from 2020 rates, to reach the highest levels seen in nearly a decade, according to the report.The State of Climate Action 2023 report, published on Tuesday and compiled by six climate thinktanks, examined all aspects of climate policy from governments across the world. Although other recent studies have found a rapid acceleration of the uptake of green technology around the world, including the expansion of renewable energy, the report found few bright spots.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But that is the only measure of the 42 indicators studied that was found to be progressing at the rate needed to cut emissions by nearly half this decade compared with 1990 levels, which is required to give the world a chance of staying within the 1.5C limit.According to the International Energy Agency, if all countries were to fulfil the pledges they have made to reduce carbon, global heating would reach about 1.7C above preindustrial temperatures. But this relies on countries implementing policies rather than simply stating goals, and the State of Climate Action report shows that countries have so far failed to come forward with the policy measures necessary to meet their goals, and to implement fully policies that they do have.Razan Al Mubarak, the UN high level champion on climate change, and part of the United Arab Emirates team that will host the Cop28 summit in Dubai later this month, called on all countries to re-examine their policies. “World leaders must recognise the insufficient progress to date and chart a path forward that builds on the successes we are seeing. This moment should serve as a springboard for accelerated actions,” she said."

        "text": "Investment funds branded as green or socially responsible are being used by some of the world’s largest asset managers to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in fossil fuel companies, according to a report.The research by the Common Wealth thinktank showed that the US fund managers BlackRock and State Street and the UK-based Legal & General were among asset managers to use funds with an “environment, social and governance” (ESG) label to invest in fossil fuel firms.The leftwing thinktank said that despite claims that ESG funds offer a green and socially responsible option for investors, “the research shows these funds are significantly exposed to fossil fuel companies”.Between February and April this year, BlackRock, State Street and Legal & General alone were found to hold $1bn (£800m) in bonds issued by fossil fuel companies in their ESG funds..Research by Sophie Flinders, a data analyst, found that more broadly ESG funds had invested more than $1.5bn in the bonds of top coal, oil and gas companies – raising questions about sustainability claims made by asset managers.ESG funds account for a small portion of the world’s assets under management, which reached $126tn in 2022, according to the data provider Morningstar.A report by the accountancy firm PwC last year said fund managers were expected to increase their ESG-related assets under management to $33.9tn by 2026, from $18.4tn in 2021.However, critics of ESG have accused the asset management industry of “greenwashing” as it seeks to attract ethical investors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A spokesperson said its funds “provide investors with choice in how they make sustainable investments, whether that be in clean energy, investments that explicitly exclude fossil fuels or those that are more broadly diversified, including investments in issuers that are actively transitioning.”Legal & General Investment Management said it invested in fossil fuel firms to actively encourage their transition to more sustainable energy sources. It argued that some coalmining businesses invested in renewable energy, and that with “active engagement” investors could speed up the shift away from fossil fuels.A spokesperson said: “We believe investing to support companies to make the transition to a low-carbon world will have a greater impact on real-economy emissions than simply divesting.”"

They are not the only bioluminescent sharks – roughly one in 10 species has that ability – but at up to 1.8 metres, kitefins are by far the biggest that have been found.Jérôme Mallefet, a biologist at the Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium, had been hoping for years to see a glowing kitefin shark. “That was one of my holy grails, to see that big shark glowing,” he says. Studies in the 1980s suggested they have light-emitting organs in their brown skin, but nobody had seen one alive and illuminated.Three sides of a kitefin shark. Photograph: Jérôme Mallefet/FNRSHis dream came true 1,000 miles east of New Zealand, onboard a fisheries research vessel that was using a huge, commercial-scale trawl net to survey species inhabiting the twilight zone, about 800 metres down. Previous surveys of the area regularly caught kitefin sharks, but Mallefet was the first person to carefully transfer them into a darkened room. With the lights turned down low, he saw the live kitefin sharks had a blue-green glow across their bodies.Smaller species of deep-sea sharks use their lights for survival and to communicate with one another. Some have spines on their backs that are illuminated like lightsabers, warning intruders to leave them alone. Some males illuminate their claspers, the shark equivalent of a penis, a trick that presumably helps attract mates. And many of the sharks have glowing bellies, which help them hide their silhouettes from predators lurking beneath them in the deep, by blending into the blue light from the surface.But kitefin sharks are so big they don’t need to worry much about hiding from other predators.Mallefet believes their glowing underside may illuminate the seabed to help them hunt, while at the same time letting them sneak up on prey without being seen.This would also explain how kitefins have been found with much faster-swimming sharks in their stomachs. Kitefins are among the slowest of all sharks; at their normal cruising speed, it would take them more than 10 minutes to amble 100 metres. These big, slow sharks are probably gliding around the twilight zone and launching surprise attacks on prey that rest on the bottom. “Just like a cat jumping on the mouse,” says Mallefet.To produce light, sharks have tiny cup-shaped structures, called photophores, dotted across their skin. In the centre of each cup are light-emitting cells, and a lens on top directs the light outwards. Bioluminescence in sharks is controlled by hormones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It is a slow process, and sharks can glow for an hour or two. “Once they light up, they cannot change rapidly,” he says.One aspect of shark bioluminescence that remains enigmatic, including for kitefin sharks, is how exactly they produce light. Many glowing animals house symbiotic bacteria in their bodies that act as luminous partners, but none have been found in sharks. Other glowing creatures produce chemicals that carry out light-emitting reactions.In sharks, these are also proving difficult to track down. “It’s still a mystery,” says Mallefet."

        "text": "Businesses in the UK are facing waits of up to 15 years for solar installations on their homes due to a lack of grid connectivity, MPs have found.The environmental audit committee, which looks at green policies in government, has said there is a “dark cloud of delays” hindering the country from reaching its potential when it comes to renewable energy.An inquiry by the MPs into solar energy has found that the government’s ambition to install 70GW of solar by 2035 may not happen if these delays continue. It found that in some cases, customers were having to wait 10 to 15 years to secure a connection for solar installations.MPs said there were three key areas where the current approach on grid connection was delaying progress: a lack of physical infrastructure such as cables and transformers; poor availability of data on solar photovoltaic generation, particularly for small-scale installations; and a “queueing system” of applications where developers are applying for grid connections without the project having planning permission.Though the committee said solar energy did not need subsidies due to how cheap it was to generate, it did find that the costs of installation could be prohibitive.MPs recommended the government should consider consulting on how it could facilitate affordable loans for households, and to give a VAT discount to household battery storage.The committee is launching another inquiry into the lack of connectivity in the UK, looking at barriers hindering low-carbon technologies from connecting to the grid. It will also consider the potential for a smarter and more flexible grid that enables dynamic demand management and peer-to-peer electricity trading and storing.The chair of the committee, Philip Dunne, said the delays could stop the UK from reaching net zero emissions by 2050.He said: “There is potential for solar energy to have a bright future in the UK, but a dark cloud of delays for the industry hinders the ability to meet its full potential. Evidence to our committee made clear that the UK has the potential to fulfil the UK’s ambition of 70GW of generating capacity from solar. But sticking points for households around access to finance and VAT being slapped on batteries remain.“The ability for low-carbon energy sources, including solar, to be able to connect to the grid could seriously jeopardise net zero Britain. Our solar inquiry found that some developers wait up to 15 years for a grid connection: this simply isn’t good enough. We must make sure that concerns around infrastructure and planning are addressed swiftly.“Given our committee’s mounting concerns over grid connections for low-carbon energy projects, we are today launching a new inquiry that will consider this in greater detail. I encourage anyone with views on these issues to submit evidence.”"

They should have been there in the first meeting.”Mensforth said the health department’s presence was crucial because “the main reason we opened it was to ensure that the water supply for Menindee was fine”.The water supply remained within Australian drinking water guidelines throughout the incident.

        "text": "The government is increasing its air source heat pump grants for homeowners in England and Wales by 50% to £7,500 from Monday amid criticism about slow adoption of the low-carbon technology.The £2,500 in extra support – on top of £5,000 offered – aims to take the cost of installing an air source heat pump below that of the average gas boiler.Support for installing ground source heat pumps – which are not suitable for many homes in the UK as they can require access to a large outdoor space – will increase from £6,000 to £7,500.The rise, which was announced by the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, last month alongside the watering down of a planned ban on new gas boilers by 2035, comes after the government faced criticism from the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) on its home heating policies.Heat pumps are seen as critical to meeting the UK’s 2035 climate targets by halving the carbon emissions from heating buildings, which still accounts for almost one-quarter of the UK’s fossil fuel demand.But the government’s stated ambition for 600,000 heat pumps to be installed every year by 2028 has struggled to find public support due to the high upfront costs of installations and a lack of clear information.The NIC said last week that the current rate of heat pump installation is “not cutting the mustard” and the scheme’s funding needs to increase if more households are to benefit. The scheme’s current budget is underspent, according to PA, as households balk at the cost and complexity of switching.UK must offer businesses certainty over green energy, says boss of FTSE 100 firmRead moreThe infrastructure tsars called on the government to spend up to £4bn every year for the next 12 years to cover the full cost of heat pump installations, and support energy-efficiency improvements for the 1.5 million households on the lowest incomes in England.It also said the better off should be given access to 0% finance to cover additional costs beyond the heat pump grant and for further funds to be invested to update social housing heating systems.Around 8m buildings will need to switch from gas boilers, which heat around nine in 10 English properties, to cleaner alternatives by 2035 to meet the UK’s 2050 net zero target, the commission said.Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus Energy – which has invested heavily in developing heat pumps – said: “We see enormous demand for heat pumps as they’re three or four times more energy efficient than gas boilers, and with these government grants they’re affordable to install too.”The government said it has set aside £10m to support innovation to cut installation costs of heat pumps. It is also launching an advertising campaign to promote energy efficiency measures in the homes this winter.The energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, said: “No one should have to choose between cutting costs and cutting emissions. Our pragmatic approach means we can continue to deliver on our ambitious net zero targets without unfairly hitting the pockets of hardworking families.” This article was amended on 23 October 2023. An earlier version said that ground source heat pumps are not suitable for most homes in the UK as they require access to a large outdoor space; this has been amended to refer to the pumps not being suitable for many homes as they can require access to a large outdoor space."

        "text": "Three “super-tipping points” for climate action could trigger a cascade of decarbonisation across the global economy, according to a report.Relatively small policy interventions on electric cars, plant-based alternatives to meat and green fertilisers would lead to unstoppable growth in those sectors, the experts said.But the boost this would give to battery and hydrogen production would mean crucial knock-on benefits for other sectors including energy storage and aviation.Urgent emissions cuts are needed to avoid irreversible climate breakdown and the experts say the super-tipping points are the fastest way to drive global action, offering “plausible hope” that a rapid transition to a green economy can happen in time.The tipping points occur when a zero-carbon solution becomes more competitive than the existing high-carbon option. More sales lead to cheaper products, creating feedback loops that drive exponential growth and a rapid takeover. The report, launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said the three super-tipping points would cut emissions in sectors covering 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions.Speedy action is vital to help avoid triggering disastrous tipping points in the climate system. Scientists said recently that global heating had driven the world to the brink of multiple tipping points with global impacts, including the collapse of Greenland’s ice cap and a key current in the north Atlantic.“With time running out, there is a need for action to be targeted,” said Mark Meldrum, at the consultancy Systemiq, which produced the report with partners including the University of Exeter, UK. Each super-tipping point crossed raises the chance of crossing others, he said. “That could set off a cascade to steer us away from a climate catastrophe.”The tipping point for electric vehicles is very close with sales soaring, the report says. Setting dates around the world for the end of sales of fossil-fuel powered vehicles, such as the 2030 date set for new vehicles by the UK and 2035 in China, drives further growth, the report adds.This scale-up means the batteries used will become cheaper and these can be deployed as storage for wind and solar power, further accelerating the growth of renewables. More green energy means lower electricity bills, in turn making heat pumps even more cost-effective.The second super-tipping point is setting mandates for green fertilisers, to replace current fertilisers, which are produced from fossil gas. Ammonia is a key ingredient and can be made from hydrogen produced by renewable energy, combined with nitrogen from the air.Governments requiring a growing proportion of fertiliser to be green will drive a scale-up and cost reductions in the production of green hydrogen, the report says. That then supports long-distance aviation and shipping, and steel production, which will rely on hydrogen to end their carbon emissions. Mandates are being considered with India, for example, targeting 5% green fertiliser production by 2023–24 and 20% by 2027–28.The third super-tipping point is helping alternative proteins to beat animal-based proteins on cost, while at least matching them on taste. Meat and dairy cause about 15% of global emissions. Public procurement of plant-based meat and dairy replacements by government departments, schools and hospitals could be a powerful lever, the report says.Increasing uptake would cut the emissions from cattle and reduce the destruction of forests for pasture land. A 20% market share by 2035 would mean 400m-800m hectares of land would no longer be needed for livestock and their fodder, equivalent to 7-15% of the world’s farmland today, the report estimated. That land could then be used for the restoration of forests and wildlife, removing CO2 from the air.Tipping points already passed within countries include electric car sales in Norway and the plunge in coal-powered electricity in the US in the past decade.“We need to find and trigger positive socioeconomic tipping points if we are to limit the risk from damaging climate tipping points,” said Prof Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter. “This non-linear way of thinking about the climate problem gives plausible grounds for hope: the more that gets invested in socioeconomic transformation, the faster it will unfold – getting the world to net zero greenhouse gas emissions sooner.”"

And Birds Queensland has officially nominated them as the mascot of the 2032 Brisbane Olympic Games, pointing out that previous Australian Olympic mascots have mostly been mammals.They say it’s time to give a bird a go – but it’s not the only one in the running. The Queensland tourism minister, Stirling Hinchliffe, has already proposed the humble and familiar “bin chicken” (Australian white ibis). But the ibis’s dumpster-diving habits and distinctive odour doesn’t make it an easy sell to international visitors.As Brisbane looks ahead to the Olympics, the survival of a heritage-listed school hangs in the balanceRead moreSo, why the palm cockatoo? Unlike ibis, the cockatoos are unique to far north Queensland in Australia, living in the remote savannahs of Cape York. (They are more widespread in New Guinea and the Indonesian Aru Islands, so Birds Queensland is encouraging the government to involve our neighbours in celebrations, using the cockatoo as a tool of soft diplomacy.)For all the behaviours cited in the first paragraph, palm cockatoos are ridiculously charismatic. I’ve seen them for myself. Late last November, in the mind-melting heat of Kutini-Payamu national park on northern Cape York, I watched a pair in full display for half an hour as the male showed off a prospective hollow to its mate.They are an unforgettable sight. And they are super marketable. Dr Christina Zdenek, who has been researching the birds for over a decade, asks us to imagine the spectacle (not to mention cacophony) of a stadium full of people with big crested hats on their heads and drumming on the seats.Which, yes, would probably mean everyone would have to stand up to see. Still, that’s got to be better than everyone conking the person in front of them on the head with ibis-billed projections on their noggins. Whatever: we are talking about a lot of plush toys here, folks. And Olympic recognition could spur immediate action for palm cockatoo conservation.Australia Weekend signupBecause palm cockatoos need our help. Like many of our large arboreal birds, including owls and other cockatoos, the biggest threat is the loss of mature trees – at least 300 years old – containing hollows large enough to house the species. Land clearing and late dry-season fires are destroying the species’ breeding habitat.The birds have a hard enough time breeding as it is. Though long-lived, palm cockatoos are especially slow to reproduce. Females lay just one egg every two years and, for reasons that are not entirely clear, have an extremely high nest failure rate: on average, only one chick successfully fledges (that is, leaves the nest) every decade.Quick GuideHow to get the latest news from Guardian AustraliaShow Email: sign up for our daily morning and afternoon email newslettersApp: download our free app and never miss the biggest storiesSocial: follow us on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook or TwitterPodcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite appPhotograph: Tim Robberts/Stone RFWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Making, shipping, installing and maintaining artificial nest boxes on remote Cape York is unlikely to be economically feasible, and there’s no guarantee the cockatoos would use them anyway. So looking after the birds’ remaining habitat is, at this stage, the best way to look after them, with more research required.The Sydney 2000 Olympic mascots included Syd the Platypus, Millie the Echidna and Olly the Kookaburra (as well as the unofficial Fatso the Fat-Arsed Wombat), while the Paralympics featured Lizzie, the Frill-necked Lizard. But Australia has the greatest diversity of parrots of any nation on earth. As a music tragic, bird nerd and Queenslander, I’m voting for Polly the Palmie to rock the games. This article was amended on 26 June 2022 to make clear that female palm cockatoos lay one egg every two years, not “biannually”."

She might be even more thrilled if she’d seen them in Yorkshire.The climate crisis has prompted the Royal Horticultural Society to plan a move of its important collection of rhododendrons from its flagship Wisley garden in Surrey to Harlow Carr in North Yorkshire, the Guardian can reveal.It follows similar decisions to move Wisley’s national collections of rhubarb and gooseberries to the Bridgewater garden in Salford.On one level the move is pragmatic in that all the plants are expected to do better in the north of England because of a changing climate.Dry springs and warmer temperatures generally have meant rhododendrons have been struggling in some parts of southern England. “They’re surviving but they’re not really thriving,” said Paul Cook, Harlow Carr’s curator.Visitors on the winter walk at RHS Harlow Carr in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“We’ve got cooler soil and a generally cooler climate,” he said, so Harlow Carr’s rhododendrons had been doing extremely well.Battleston Hill at Wisley has long been famed for its rhododendrons, with the original plantings made in 1937.“It is quite an amazing collection really of rhododendrons, camellias, magnolias,” said Cook. “It was devastated in the Great Storm [of 1987] and replanted shortly after and the collection there is pretty much one of the best in the country, certainly the best of the RHS gardens.”There are hundreds of varieties of rhododendron at Wisley and the first stage will be to work out precisely what the garden has and give priority to endangered ones.“It is a long-term project and won’t happen in the next couple of years, but it is something which will be worth doing,” said Cook.Harlow Carr was acquired by the RHS in 2001. Before that it was the display garden of the Northern Horticultural Society, with the driving force being the gardener, writer and broadcaster Geoffrey Smith, a regular on Radio 4’s Gardeners’ Question Time.A lot of the planting Smith did in the 1950s and 1960s needs replacing which, said Cook, meant “we’ve got plenty of room in the 30-odd acres of woodland we’ve got and that’s one of the long-term plans, to have a collection that will in the next 50 years be maturing and become really important regardless of which garden it’s at”.Some rhododendrons may also go to Salford where they might well do even better, said Cook. The plan does not mean Wisley will be without rhododendrons and it may instead have American hybrids, which prefer warmer summers.“It’s not about one garden having one collection, it is about spreading the collections around the country as well.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But next summer it should be a joyous riot of plants including salvias, dahlias, gingers and cannas.Team leader Russ Watkins, the mastermind of the Sub-Tropicana garden, said: “When I go to visit other gardens the things that excite me are the things I don’t see all the time – so the more exotic … bananas and things like that. It’s about giving visitors things they wouldn’t expect to see in North Yorkshire.“We have never grown this sort of stuff here before and it has been a great way to experiment and discover new things. For example, we are more and more finding that salvias are much tougher than people think.”"

The thinktank has produced reviews – at odds with mainstream science – that claim the climate emergency is not happening, or downplay the extent of it.Tory MPs have at various times been trustees of the thinktank, including until recently the Northern Ireland minister, Steve Baker. He quit his trusteeship when he took up the ministerial post.£3.5m of Tory donations linked to pollution and climate denial, says reportRead moreIt has recently led the backlash against government net zero policies, and celebrated when Rishi Sunak recently announced his intention to roll back on climate measures. The Guardian revealed last year that the thinktank had received funding from groups with oil and gas interests.The environment secretary already faces conflict of interest concerns over his wife’s job at a water company. Karen Barclay holds a senior position at Anglian Water as head of major infrastructure, planning and stakeholder engagement. As secretary of state, Barclay is responsible for overseeing the regulation of water companies. He is responsible for ensuring water firms make improvements regarding sewage pollution via the government’s storm overflow reduction plan.Regarding the donation, campaigners have said it is inappropriate for someone charged with protecting the natural world to take funds from someone who is such a major backer of a climate sceptic group.Jolyon Maugham, the director of the Good Law Project, said: “Steve Barclay is taking money from a man who has been a key funder of a climate change denial group and who has ties to Tufton Street. And he’s the environment secretary? Is this some kind of hilarious Conservative party in-joke? Because the younger generation aren’t laughing – and neither is the global south.”MPs are expected to ask if Barclay agrees with or endorses the views of the GWPF.Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: “Steve Barclay has some serious questions to answer. When our natural world faces ever-increasing threats as a result of the climate emergency, we can’t have an environment secretary taking donations from a major backer of the climate-denying GWPF. I’d like to know why Barclay accepted this donation; what conversations with Lord Hintze he had before and since receiving it; and whether he agrees with GWPF’s climate-denying views.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Menindee residents who spoke with Guardian Australia on Friday said the latest fish kill appeared larger than previous mass deaths.About a million fish died during a sustained drought in the same area in 2019 after a rapid drop in temperature led to an algal bloom de-oxygenating the river.Resident Graeme McCrabb said the scale of the mass kill on Friday was “unfathomable”.“It’s horrendous here today,” he said, speaking from the riverbank about 5km upstream of Menindee. “The river is just white. I’m looking at probably a kilometre or a kilometre-and-a-half of fish and they’re all dead. It’s unfathomable.”Authorities say the fish deaths – here visible at the main weir of the Menindee Lakes - are the result of a lack of oxygen in receding flood waters.

The current hot weather in the region is also exacerbating hypoxia, as warmer water holds less oxygen than cold water and fish have higher oxygen needs at warmer temperatures,” the spokesperson said.“This event is ongoing as a heatwave across western NSW continues to put further stress on a system that has experienced extreme conditions from wide-scale flooding.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Locals have previously accused authorities of contributing to fish deaths by allowing the Menindee Lakes to be drained and not effectively managing water quality. Officials have denied that they were responsible.Associate Prof Joy Becker, from the University of Sydney’s School of Life and Environmental Sciences, said an investigation should determine the cause of the mass death.“Ultimately, fish kill events happen because the quality of the environment cannot sustain fish life,” she said. “It is important to remember that fish kill events impact not only the large-body fish like the Murray cod and bony bream, but also the small-body fish like the gudgeons that are essential to maintaining a healthy aquatic ecosystem.”The independent MP Justin Field said “we are living in the age of climate change”, with increasingly extreme floods and droughts being compounded by poor government decisions. “No one should think fish kills on this scale is natural,” he said."

People were told to chug extra water while mowing lawns or exercising outdoors, and to check on neighbors to ensure air conditioning is available. The extreme heat prompted Texas’s electric power grid manager to ask residents to voluntarily conserve power for three hours on Sunday night.California braced for ‘catastrophic’ flooding from Storm HilaryRead moreThe Dallas-Fort Worth area was prepared to reach 110F (43.3C) on Sunday after hitting 108F (42.2C) on Saturday, said National Weather Service meteorologist Sarah Barnes. The record high for those dates was 107F (41.7C), set in 2011.The area is not cooling off enough at night, Barnes said.“That’s really going to contribute to an increased risk of heat-related illnesses,” Barnes said on Sunday. “That’s the main concern when it comes to people and the heat.”The electric reliability council of Texas (Ercot) on Sunday asked the state’s 30 million residents to voluntarily reduce power use from 7pm to 10pm central daylight time because of “extreme temperatures, continued high demand and unexpected loss of thermal generation”.Ercot’s request for voluntary power conservation was the second such plea in the past three days. The agency said it was not in emergency operations. Many residents still view the power grid nervously more than two and a half years after a deadly winter blackout.Meanwhile, parts of Texas’s Gulf coast were also put under a warning for what could be a tropical storm forecast to move ashore on Tuesday.Elsewhere, other state officials were urging caution during this latest heatwave.“These high temperatures can [affect] our friends, families, and neighbors who may live alone, especially if they limit their use of air conditioning,” Sarah Russell, commissioner for the emergency management agency in St Louis, Missouri, said in a statement. “We urge everyone to stop and visit loved ones to ensure they are healthy and well during this extreme heat.”The heatwave causing misery is just the latest to punish the US this year.Scientists have long warned that climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, by deforestation and by certain agricultural practices, will lead to more and prolonged bouts of extreme weather, including hotter temperatures.The entire globe has simmered to record heat in both June and July. And if that’s not enough, smoke from wildfires, floods and droughts have caused problems globally.The National Weather Service issued an excessive heat warning on Sunday for parts of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska. Heat advisories or watches were also in place in parts of Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota and South Dakota.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports just 600 to 700 heat deaths annually in the United States.

The EU made 410TWh of electricity from sources that release planet-heating gases, which analysts say is the lowest level since 2015 – the first year for which they have monthly data – and “very likely” since 2000.The drop in fossil fuel generation was driven by a fall in demand for electricity, as well as some growth in clean power, the study found.“We’re glad to see fossil fuels down, but in the long-term it is not going to be sustainable to rely on the fall in demand to do this,” said Matt Ewen, a data analyst at Ember and author of the report. “We have to be replacing this energy rather than just expecting it to go away and not be used.”To try to stop the planet heating, the EU has promised to cut greenhouse gas pollution by at least 55% from 1990 levels by the end of the decade, and hit net zero emissions by 2050. To get there, it will probably have to use less energy but more electricity than it does today, as more people heat homes and drive cars with electricity instead of fossil fuels.The report found that fossil generation in the first half of 2023 fell more than 20% in 11 EU countries and more than 30% in five of them. Fourteen countries saw their lowest total fossil generation on record for the period. In seven countries – Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Poland and Slovenia – fossil fuel burning hit its lowest levels this century.The findings back up analysis in June from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a nonprofit research organisation, which showed “a clear shift away from fossil fuel-based power generation in the EU”.But even as high energy prices have brought down demand, “the EU’s reliance on fossil fuels persists”, said Petras Katinas, an energy analyst at CREA and co-author of the report.He said: “This dependence extends to external sources as well. Given that a significant portion of the EU’s fossil fuel needs are met through imports from third countries, a vulnerability exists. Even a minor disruption in the supply chain could lead to price hikes and potential energy shortages.”The Ember report found growth in solar power continued in the first half of the year, making 13% more electricity than it did in the same period in 2022. Wind generation rose by 5%, while hydropower grew 11% after a shortfall from widespread drought last year. Nuclear generation fell 4%, but is set to climb during the year.Several countries broke records for the share of their power that came from renewable sources of energy, the report found. Greece and Romania passed 50% for the first time and Denmark and Portugal broke 75%.After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, gas prices shot up and the EU introduced emergency measures to cut demand. With winter also unexpectedly mild, demand for electricity fell 5% in the first half of 2023 compared with 2022.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It also said they should “urgently” expand the electricity grid, build more batteries to store electricity and streamline the process to get permits for clean energy infrastructure.“We shouldn’t be complacent about the winter ahead,” said Ewen. “You need to keep pushing.”\nThis article was updated on 30 August 2023 to correct the EU’s emissions targets; they are a cut of 55% from 1990 levels by 2030 and net zero by 2050, not 65% by 2030 and net zero by 2045.\n"

        "text": "Blending hydrogen into the UK’s gas heating systems could raise consumer bills by almost £200 for an average household, analysis suggests.The blending of natural gas with about 20% hydrogen, for use in home heating systems, is one of the key recommendations by the government’s hydrogen champion, Jane Toogood, in a report to ministers on how to produce and use hydrogen in the UK.But a group of green campaigners, thinktanks and energy companies have written to the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, urging him to reconsider. Analysis by the thinktank E3G shows hydrogen blending could increase the average household’s heating bill by about £192 a year.In the letter, seen by the Guardian, the groups warn that blending hydrogen into the gas supply would require consumers to use more gas, as hydrogen provides less energy than fossil gas when used in this way. “We disagree with the report’s recommendation to stimulate demand for hydrogen through blending and heating,” wrote the groups, led by E3G.“This puts the early costs of building the hydrogen economy on the shoulders of consumers, who will bear the costs of higher energy bills and costs of conversion – on top of the proposed ‘hydrogen levy’ set out in the energy bill. As hydrogen is more expensive than the gas currently used to heat most UK homes, a 20% blend can only raise consumer prices. Raising energy bills during a cost of living crisis is the wrong way to develop industrial demand for hydrogen.”The government is expected to decide this year whether to press ahead with plans for the blending of hydrogen into the UK’s natural gas networks, which could happen as soon as 2025. Ministers are also considering a hydrogen levy on bills to fund its development.The hydrogen champion report calls on the government to “make the strategic decision to support blending of hydrogen into the gas network in 2023 and confirm a ‘minded to’ position on suitable commercial arrangements to support blending”.Hydrogen is being touted as a potentially green fuel, to help the UK meet its goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. But campaigners have two concerns: first, that hydrogen should be produced from renewable energy rather than as a byproduct from fossil fuel production; and that some uses being suggested for hydrogen are unsuitable.The government is still considering hydrogen for home heating, because some gas specialists argue it could be used in current boilers without the need for new infrastructure. But a growing number of studies show that hydrogen would be unsuitable, or prohibitively expensive, for heating compared with alternative technologies such as heat pumps.The letter also raises concerns over “hydrogen-ready boilers”. These are essentially the same as existing gas boilers, and the attraction – for the government, and for installers and suppliers – is that they could be used without major changes to the UK’s existing gas heating infrastructure.But experts doubt hydrogen-ready boilers will ever use hydrogen, because hydrogen produces less heat than natural gas, and as sources of green hydrogen are likely to be limited it makes more sense to use that hydrogen for industrial processes where there are few or no green alternatives, than for home heating where heat pumps offer a solution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Value for money will be a key factor in determining whether to enable the wider rollout of blending on to the gas network.“The government is working closely with Ofgem and industry to explore how hydrogen could be fairly incorporated in bills and any final decision on blending will be made alongside a decision on how best to protect consumers.”"

This level of growth depends on British factories attracting the next generation of electric models and scaling up the supply chain.Production has steadily recovered since the Covid-19 pandemic and manufacturing jobs in the sector rose 4% to 208,000 in the last year. A further 24,513 battery electric vehicles joined the road in May, up 58.7% year on year to secure a 16.9% market share.Last year, when Britain’s annual car production fell by nearly a tenth to 775,014, the lowest in more than six decades, UK factories produced a record 234,066 battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid and hybrid electric vehicles, with combined volumes rising 4.5% year-on-year to make up nearly a third of overall output.On Tuesday, the SMMT called on all political parties to recognise the strategic importance of the sector to the UK, which faces fierce global competition as other countries offer huge cash incentives and subsidies to attract green manufacturing.The business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, told the conference she had “heard very loud and clear the issues on rules of origin”, and said she planned to raise the issue with the EU’s ambassador to the UK on Tuesday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Tuesday, it set out measures to “turbocharge” the switch to electric motoring.The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, announced a plan to rapidly scale up electric vehicle battery production, which Labour said could create 80,000 jobs and trigger more than £30bn in investment.Speaking at the SMMT conference, Haigh urged the government to take urgent action on the Brexit trade rules. “Labour are urging the government to prioritise an agreement with the European Union to ensure manufacturers have time to prepare to meet rules of origin requirements and make Brexit work for them.”She said Labour would “build resilience and security” by ramping up domestic battery capacity and expanding the rollout of electric vehicle chargers."

The researchers compared the actual moves the players made against the optimal moves determined by the powerful chess engine Stockfish.In the tournament venues, the researchers attached three web-connected air quality sensors to measure carbon dioxide, PM2.5 concentrations, and temperature. Each tournament lasted eight weeks, meaning players faced a variety of air conditions.Fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, refers to tiny particles 2.5 microns or less in diameter, which are often expelled by burning matter such as that from car engines, coal plants, forest fires, and wood burners.“We find that when individuals are exposed to higher levels of air pollution, they make more mistakes, and they make larger mistakes,” said Juan Palacios, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sustainable Urbanization Lab and a co-author of the paper.Researchers looked at historical data to see if their findings were replicated, using data from 20 years of games from the first division of the German chess league. After accounting for other causes such as noise, temperature changes and carbon dioxide concentrations, they found air pollution accounted for dips in player performance.“It’s pure random exposure to air pollution that is driving these people’s performance,” Palacios said. “Against comparable opponents in the same tournament round, being exposed to different levels of air quality makes a difference for move quality and decision quality.”Chess.com’s Leon Watson said that professional players were already monitoring air quality while they played: “Cognition is obviously incredibly important in chess and already some of the top players like Magnus Carlsen and Anish Giri have cottoned on to how important air quality is.“When competing from home in the big Champions Chess Tour events, players now routinely monitor their CO2 and particulate matter levels using [air monitors] and use the data to create the perfect environment to play in … like in any sport, fine margins are important. The difference may be marginal, but players will inevitably try to eliminate any competitive disadvantages.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I named him Touchwood after a toad on TV I’d heard about.My dad got out his toolkit again and built a 3ft-high version of Claridge’s – moss; roof slates to hide under; a sunken bath made out of a mixing bowl. I was very jealous of Touchwood’s living space as I was sharing a bedroom with my brother, who had become interested in welding and used to practise on the carpet.In a book on frogs that my parents got me, it said toads could live for 40 years. Even if Touchwood lasted 10, he would be around past the year 2000. By that point, I figured, time travel and cloning would have been cracked. When Touchwood finally passed away, I would be able to go back and do a Jurassic Park.As it was, Mr T lasted only nine more hibernations before he croaked it one summer. I admit that, by then, my head had been turned: I’d got into breakbeat music, and luminous poison dart frogs seemed a better fit colour-wise. Not that I ever owned one, but the clips I’d seen on David Attenborough showed them leaping and eating gracefully. That wasn’t Touchwood’s style. Whenever I dug him up a worm, he’d wrestle it, as if he was trying to swallow a sausage dog.One morning as a teen, I excitedly thought I’d got Touchwood’s sex wrong and he – no, she – had laid eggs. According to my manual, they came out in a string; as I lifted the sticky threads off its back legs I thought: “I’m going to be a grandad.”My exhilaration crashed when my mate came over and told me that toad eggs didn’t look like that. Touchwood must have swallowed some long grass earlier; now it was coming out the other end.In the end, it was my mum who cloned Touchwood when she surprised me one afternoon with a flat-warming present: a fire-bellied toad. Gimlet, as my girlfriend and I named him, used to jump around his tank, and press himself against the plastic to show off the orange flashes on his underside. In the right lighting, it looked like I had a Blackpool player in my front room. As flashy as he was, he was no replacement for the original. Cheers for the all the good luck you brought me, Touchwood."

Protecting its future” – over concerns the German airline was giving consumers a “misleading impression of its environmental impact”.Lufthansa said the tag line was “open to interpretation” and consumers would not see it as an “absolute promise” relating to the environment or that its planes did not cause harm.It said the purpose of the poster campaign, which contained a link to its Make Change Fly environmental campaign website, was to address the need to reduce the impact of flying and making people aware of what Lufthansa is doing.Lufthansa said its Make Change Fly poster aimed to people aware of what the airline is doing. Photograph: ASALufthansa told the ASA that its environmental claims were based on aspirations, including becoming carbon neutral by 2050 and halving carbon emissions by 2030.However, the ASA said consumers would view the ad as a claim that Lufthansa had already taken “significant mitigating steps” to ensure that the net environmental impact of its business was not harmful.“Many of these initiatives [are] targeted to deliver results only years or decades into the future,” the ASA said. “We also understood that there were currently no environmental initiatives or commercially viable technologies in the aviation industry which would substantiate the absolute green claim ‘protecting its future’, as we considered consumers would interpret it.”The ASA banned the ad campaign, telling Lufthansa to make clearer and better substantiated environmental claims in the future and to not give a misleading impression of the impact caused by flying with the airline.“Climate change and the environment is the key and enduring issue of our age,” Miles Lockwood, the director of complaints and investigations at the ASA, said. “Advertisers in high carbon emitting sectors shouldn’t make claims that give consumers a misleading impression about their green credentials and plans or which they can’t substantiate with robust evidence.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Some of the UK’s largest investors have backtracked on their support for a shareholder resolution that would force the big oil companies to cut their carbon emissions, according to a campaign group.Asset managers at Legal & General, abrdn and Janus Henderson voted against the climate resolutions put forward by Follow This, a Dutch shareholder activist group, at the annual general meetings of the US oil companies Chevron and ExxonMobil this year, having voted in favour of them in previous years.Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, claimed that the investors had chosen to sacrifice climate action in favour of “short-term profits”, which have rocketed after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year.Van Baal said: “This is a false dilemma: shareholders can enjoy dividends from oil and gas while oil majors invest these profits in renewables to drive down emissions at the same time. Taking short-term fossil fuel profits and addressing long-term climate risks are not mutually exclusive.”Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) said it rejected the claim that it had chosen short-term profits over its commitment to climate action.It said: “To the end of May 2023, LGIM had supported 70% of shareholder resolutions on climate, and will be voting against almost 300 company directors for not meeting our climate expectations. We are supportive of the basic principles of the Follow This proposal, but still have concerns about the text of the 2023 proposals.”A spokesperson for LGIM did not clarify the company’s specific concerns when approached.Follow This has targeted all leading oil and gas companies with a shareholder resolution calling on their boards to cut their emissions in line with the scale of reductions required by the Paris climate agreement.The 2015 accords call for all countries to limit their emissions in order to stop global temperatures rising by more than 1.5C above pre-industrialised levels by 2050. Many oil companies intend to increase the amount of oil and gas they produce until 2030.Andrew Mason, the head of active ownership at abrdn, said the investor had reservations about the implications of shareholder climate resolutions because they were raised separately from financial statements or annual report and accounts.Mason said: “This can sever the fundamental link between the climate and corporate strategy, risking a lack of robust governance procedures for all vital strategic decisions. Additionally, the full evaluation of climate strategies demands significant resource; over a short period, this could lead to asset managers outsourcing responsibilities for evaluation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Any new development must also have been included in the authority’s most recent local development plan, a document that covers several years’ worth of building schemes."

After a decade-long expedition, scientists have analysed its DNA for the first time to learn how climate breakdown is affecting the species and its habitat.The ancient moss was already 100m years old before the Himalayas formed underneath it, triggering a fast adaptation process. “We set out to describe and analyse a living fossil,” said Ralf Reski, a plant biotechnologist at the University of Freiburg in Germany and an author of the paper published in the journal Cell.The expedition was not straightforward owing to the high altitude and volatile weather in the Himalayas, which the plant biologist and expedition co-leader Ruoyang Hu said could go through “four seasons within one day”.The team found that owing to these extreme weather conditions, Takakia had evolved over generations to become adept at fixing broken DNA and recovering from ultraviolet damage. In response to these conditions, the plants developed the ability to grow anywhere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Hu predicted that by the end of the 21st century, livable conditions for the Takakia will have reduced to only 1,000-1,500 square kilometres across the world.Plant scientists are attempting to preserve and prolong the survival of this species by multiplying some specimens in the laboratory and transplanting them to experimental sites in Tibet."

        "text": "Michael Gove has loosened restrictions on building onshore windfarms in England, meaning developments will no longer be quashed by one objection, but campaigners have said such schemes are still at a disadvantage.The communities secretary announced on Tuesday that the government would make a series of changes to the planning system in order to lift a de facto ban on the structures that has been in place since 2015.The move comes after a long campaign by Conservative MPs to overturn the 2015 rules, which have allowed local authorities to block new turbines based on just one complaint. Those rules have led to just 20 new onshore turbines being given planning permission in the last nine years.Gove said: “To increase our energy security and develop a cleaner, greener economy, we are introducing new measures to allow local communities to back onshore wind power projects. This will only apply in areas where developments have community support, but these changes will help build on Britain’s enormous success as a global leader in offshore wind, helping us on our journey to net zero.”Claire Coutinho, the new energy secretary, said: “Onshore wind also has a key role to play and these changes will help speed up the delivery of projects where local communities want them.”The current rules allow local authorities to stop a developer building new wind turbines if there are any unresolved queries from local residents. They ban planning authorities from giving the go-ahead to a new development unless it has been included in the last local plan, a document that can cover several years’ worth of prospective building.Under the new system, councils will be required to consider the views of the entire community rather than bowing to a single objection. They will be allowed to identify new onshore wind in other ways apart from a local plan, and the government plans to introduce an incentive scheme to make sure local residents see some of the economic benefit of new developments.The measures are the result of weeks of negotiation between ministers and a group of prospective Tory rebels who had threatened to derail the energy bill that is being debated in the Commons. That group was led by Alok Sharma, the president of Cop26 in 2021, and included Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.Onshore windfarms, which are one of the fastest and cheapest renewable energy sources to build, still face barriers that other infrastructure such as waste incinerators and even coalmines are not subject to, green experts said.Sam Richards, Johnson’s former environment adviser, said: “Today’s change tips the balance back in favour of local people who back onshore wind in their area, and should end the perverse situation we currently have whereby a single objection could block a development even if the majority are in favour.”Some argued that the changes did not go far enough. Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, has promised Labour would remove all special planning requirements for onshore wind, allowing councils to treat them like any other piece of infrastructure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Who will put their money into developing projects under those circumstances?“If [Rishi] Sunak really cared about the climate, delivering energy security or lowering bills, he’d stop obsessing over oil and gas and just actually remove the planning constraints to get wind turbines built here. It’s really not that hard.”Alethea Warrington, a senior campaigner at the climate charity Possible, said: “The minor changes announced today are nowhere close to enough to unblock wind. Today’s small step forward leaves new onshore wind in England still facing higher planning barriers than anything else, including new coalmines, and it will still be too difficult for communities which want wind to get it.”"

        "text": "Thousands of the world’s large dams are so clogged with sediment that they risk losing more than a quarter of their storage capacity by 2050, UN researchers have concluded, warning of the threat to water security.A new study from the UN University’s Institute for Water, Environment and Health found that, by mid-century, dams and reservoirs will lose about 1.65tr cubic metres of water storage capacity to sediment.The figure is close to the combined annual water use of India, China, Indonesia, France and Canada.That is important, the researchers say, because these big dams are a key source of hydroelectricity, flood control, irrigation and drinking water throughout the world.“Global water storage is going to diminish – it is diminishing now – and that needs to be seriously taken into account,” the study’s co-author and institute director, Vladimir Smakhtin, told AFP.Researchers looked at nearly 50,000 large dams in 150 countries, and found that they have already lost about 16% of water storage capacity.They estimated that if buildup rates continue at the same pace, that will increase to about 26% by mid-century.Rivers naturally wash sediment downstream to wetlands and coasts, but dams disrupt this flow and over time the buildup of these muddy deposits gradually reduces the space for water.Smakhtin said this “endangers the sustainability of future water supplies for many”, as well as posing risks to irrigation and power generation.Accumulation of sediment can also cause flooding upstream and impact wildlife habitats and coastal populations downstream.Sedimentation is a part of a larger issue: by 2050, tens of thousands of large dams will be near or past their intended lifespan.Most of the world’s 60,000 big dams – constructed between 1930 and 1970 – were designed to last 50 to 100 years, after which they risk failure, affecting more than half the global population who will live downstream.Large dams and reservoirs are defined as higher than 15 metres (49 ft), or at least five metres high while holding back no less than 3m cubic metres of water.Global warming compounds the risk in ways that have yet to be fully measured.“Climate change extremes like floods and droughts will increase, and higher intensity showers are more erosive,” Smakhtin said.This not only increases the risk of reservoirs overflowing but also accelerates the buildup of sediment, which affects dam safety, reduces water storage capacity and lowers energy production in hydroelectric dams.To address looming challenges of ageing dams and reservoir sedimentation, the study authors list several measures.Norway blows up hydro dam to restore river health and fish stocks Read moreBypass, or sediment diversion, can divert water flow downstream through a separate river channel.Another strategy is the removal, or “decommissioning”, of a dam to re-establish the natural flow of sediment in a river.But addressing water storage issues is especially complex because there is no one-size-fits-all solution, Smakhtin said.“The loss of water storage is inevitable for different reasons,” Smakhtin said. “So the question we should be asking is what are the alternatives?”"

The story goes that, crossing the River Wye one day, she felt a piece of grit in her boot, took it out and hurled it across the river. It landed in the circular churchyard at Llowes, where it was long known as Moll Walbee’s Stone: a 7ft-high menhir of hard, pale-grey sandstone.Moll Walbee’s Stone or St Meilig’s Cross in St Meillig’s church, Llowes. Photograph: Jeff TomlinsonIt is now inside the church of St Meilig, in this same village, but formerly it had been at Croesfeilliog, on the eastern spur of the Begwns above Llowes, beside the road between Clyro and Painscastle. I can imagine anxious travellers in the dusk on that lonely way crossing themselves as they hastened by. The menhir, like so many similar pagan relics in the British landscape, was assimilated into the Christian tradition, a pious monk having carved on to it an unusual wheel-cross design.As the rain from Storm Ciarán lashed down last week, I took shelter in the porch of St Meilig’s church. Small flocks of fieldfare and redwing surfed eastwards on the gale, or feasted on the haws that are so abundant this autumn. Foliage on the hazel hedges was lemon-hued and luminous in the fast-fading light. I tried the church door. It was open, so I stepped inside, and there at the western end of the nave, facing towards the altar, the large, incongruous presence of this ancient megalith confronted me. I’ve seen other megaliths reconfigured for differing systems of belief – the Stones of Drumtroddan on the Isle of Whithorn in Dumfries and Galloway, for example – but none where the effect was so startlingly anomalous.My mind drifted back to Moll Walbee. Behind her name lurks an historical personage from the 12th century – Maude de Sainte Valerie. The Elizabethan historian William Camden characterised her as a “malapert, stomackfull woman”. She upbraided King John about his treatment of the young Prince Arthur, and paid for it with her life – imprisoned with her young son in Corfe Castle, with just a sheaf of wheat and a piece of bacon by way of provisions. After 11 days the room was opened. Both were found dead, the boy’s cheeks gnawed, and not by rats. Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"

        "text": "Rewetting about half of England’s lowland peat would be enough to deliver a fifth of the greenhouse gas emissions savings needed from the country’s farming by 2030, research suggests.Rewetting peat would also help restore habitats for birds, wildlife and plant species. But farming experts strongly dispute the potential for such projects.Food grown on lowland peat in England has a much higher carbon footprint than imports of soya from Brazil, according to the research, from the Green Alliance thinktank. That is because wet peat sequesters carbon, but when peat is drained and farmed it emits about 19 times as much carbon as non-peat cropland.The Green Alliance said the findings showed that rewetting peat, through removing drainage or building dams to retain water on the land, should be a government priority. Lowland peat occupies only about 1% of the UK’s farmland, so even if half were rewetted it would have little impact on land availability, according to the analysis, but make a substantial contribution to the UK’s efforts to reach net zero.However, farmers said drained peatlands – including the fens of East Anglia – were some of the UK’s most productive farmland, so a simple comparison of land area would not reflect their true value.Farming is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions but so far government efforts to reduce agricultural emissions have not produced the changes needed. Farmers could be given stronger incentives to rewet lowland peat on their farms through the government’s environmental land management schemes, as current incentives appear ineffective, according to the Green Alliance analysis.Lydia Collas, the author of the research at Green Alliance, said: “In its natural form, lowland peat can support a huge range of wetland species and absorb significant rainfall, preventing flooding downstream.“Everyone knows that clearing Brazilian rainforest for soya production is a disaster for the climate and for nature, but we’re sabotaging our own environment by growing grain on lowland peat.”Farmers were unconvinced, however. Aidan Gill, an environment policy adviser at the National Farmers’ Union, said the impacts on food of rewetting peat could be substantial, depending on the areas affected.“The highly productive East Anglian fens produce more than 7% of England’s total agricultural production, worth £1.2bn, so rewetting peat soils [there] would be quite a significant land use change and have a big impact on UK food security,” he said.He added that there were many practical obstacles, as fields could not be rewetted in isolation, and there was a risk of flooding to surrounding areas.Gareth Morgan, the head of farming policy at the Soil Association, also urged caution. “The fens are crucial for rural communities and domestic food production, supplying a third of British-grown vegetables.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It is the third national emergency to be declared in the country’s history.The scale of damage is not yet known, with entire regions cut off from road access, electricity and mobile networks, neighbourhoods submerged by flood waters and landslides destroying homes and state highways.Redcliffe Bridge is closed off as debris piles up along the Tutaekuri River in the suburb of Taradale Photograph: Kerry Marshall/Getty ImagesShaw, who is co-leader of the Green party, attributed the scale of the disaster to the climate crisis, saying: “There will be people who say it’s ‘too soon’ to talk about these things … but we are standing in it right now. This is a climate change-related event. The severity of it, of course, made worse by the fact that our global temperatures have already increased by 1.1 degrees.“We need to stop making excuses for inaction. We cannot put our heads in the sand when the beach is flooding. We must act now.”Scientists have long predicted that global heating would cause more frequent and intense weather events, including stronger storms and heavier, more sporadic rainfall. New Zealand’s North Island has experienced extraordinarily heavy rains this summer: the MetService said on Tuesday that Auckland had 48% of its annual rainfall in just 45 days this year.Cyclone Gabrielle batters New Zealand – in pictures Read moreThe cyclone comes just two weeks after record rainfall caused devastating flooding in Auckland and Northland, damaging thousands of homes and killing four. At the time, the flood was named the most destructive climate-related event in New Zealand’s history.The devastation from Cyclone Gabrielle is expected to overtake that. On Tuesday afternoon, there were no formal figures available yet on people injured or evacuated or the scale of houses and infrastructure damaged.“Just when we thought we had had our worst climate-related disaster in this country only two weeks ago, we are facing an even more significant challenge,” Shaw said.Quoting Winston Churchill, he said: “The era of procrastination, of half measures, of soothing and baffling expedience of delays is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences.”In an interview with the Guardian, Shaw said he had spoken to New Zealand’s prime minister and finance minister about action that could allow those receiving insurance payments to rebuild their homes to relocate elsewhere instead.“Some of those houses are in places where it’s a bad idea to have a house,” he said, referring to the “tens of thousands” of New Zealand homes built on flood plains or erosion-prone coastlines.“There are decisions that we could make that I think would lead to longer term resilience and a more adaptive response that if we don’t make them, you’ll probably just get a reversion to the status quo,” said Shaw.But he cautioned against a shift away from reducing emissions in order to foot the bill for dealing with the effects of the climate crisis.“There will be a certain crowd who say … let’s give up on stopping climate change and its focus entirely on responding to the effects of climate change and I cannot state enough what a catastrophic mistake that would be,” Shaw said. “Because every tenth of a degree of warming increases the frequency and the severity of these events.”"

        "text": "The competition watchdog will step up its probe of companies’ environmental claims after an initial sweep found more than half made misleading statements ranging from overstating climate action to developing their own certification schemes.The survey of 247 businesses or brands across eight sectors by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission last October found 57% had promoted “concerning claims about their environmental credentials”.“Consumers are now, more than ever, making purchasing decisions on environmental grounds,” said ACCC deputy chair Catriona Lowe. “Unfortunately, it appears that rather than making legitimate changes to their practices and procedures, some businesses are relying on false or misleading claims.”Solar to soon offer grid more capacity than coal, consultancy saysRead moreBusinesses genuinely pursuing more sustainable goods and services often incur additional production or research costs. They face being unfairly disadvantaged if rivals can get away with making false or misleading claims, the ACCC said: “This undermines effective competition and can create a disincentive for businesses to invest in sustainability.”Known broadly as “greenwashing”, the practice of making vague or unwarranted claims has been in the sights of regulators for years. Firms have been able to avoid significant penalties for such action, although court cases might soon change that.The corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, this week launched its first court proceedings alleging greenwashing.ASIC alleges Mercer Superannuation (Australia) Ltd made statements on its website about seven “Sustainable Plus” investment options that were misleading. Some investments had companies that website statements stated as excluded, such as fossil fuel producers, Whitehaven Coal and Glencore PLC, ASIC will tell the federal court.The ACCC said its sweep indicated a significant proportion of businesses may be making environmental claims that deserve closer scrutiny.“Already, we have several active investigations underway across the packaging, consumer goods, food manufacturing and medical devices sectors for alleged misleading environmental claims,” Lowe said. “[T]hese may grow, as we continue to conduct more targeted assessments into businesses and claims identified through the sweep.”Of the eight sectors surveyed, cosmetic, clothing and footwear, and food and drink industries had the highest proportion of concerning claims. Vehicles and the electronics and home appliance sectors fared relatively well.Firms making vague and unqualified claims topped the list of most common issues, with many businesses describing their products as “green”, “kind to the planet”, “eco-friendly”, “responsible” or “sustainable”.“These claims have little value for consumers as they can have a variety of different meanings and rarely provide enough information to allow consumers to make an informed purchasing decision,” the ACCC said.In other cases, companies were making claims without providing any supporting evidence. Some firms claimed to provide proof but the web links provided were broken, the watchdog said.Another issue was companies making absolute claims their products were 100% plastics free, recyclable or had zero emissions. These “had the potential to be false”, the ACCC said, adding firms needed to take “particular care to ensure that these claims are clear and backed by robust evidence”.Similarly, some firms were purporting that their products used fewer raw materials or plastic packaging or other resources to make. However, consumers were not given details how much less material was needed, nor what the comparison involved.In other instances, companies exaggerated sustainability benefits or omitted negative attributes that might be relevant to a consumer’s choice. For instance, a firm might promote investments in renewable energy projects but still source most of its products from fossil-fuel based industries, the ACCC said.Carbon emissions from global SUV fleet outweighs that of most countriesRead moreAnother business might claim that offsetting its carbon emissions had a “positive” impact on the environment even though it had not taken steps to reduce its overall carbon emissions, the watchdog said.Another common practice for firms surveyed was to claim affiliation with a variety of certification schemes, an approach that could potentially mislead consumers.“Some businesses have also created their own certification schemes for their own products,” the ACCC said. “This raises concerns that [schemes] may be becoming meaningless, and no longer help consumers to distinguish between different products.”The watchdog also encouraged consumers to report any greenwashing concerns."

        "text": "Corporate greenwashing should not undermine the message behind Earth Day and has nothing to do with its original aims, one of the founders of the annual environmental event has warned.Denis Hayes, the American environmental activist who coordinated the first Earth Day in 1970, denounced the “appalling” environmental messaging by oil, gas and other extractive companies and said he hoped it did not distract attention from the threats posed by the climate crisis and biodiversity loss, which he compared to the threat of nuclear conflict during the cold war.Protests and events have been planned across the globe for this year’s Earth day, with millions of people expected to take part today.Hayes was hired to organise a national teach-in about environmentalism by the US senator Gaylord Nelson while at Harvard in 1970, and helped transform it into the largest environmental movement in history. About 20 million people across the US took part on the first Earth Day on 22 April 1970 and public pressure from the event is credited with ensuring the passing of the 1972 Clean Water Act. It has since become a global movement, with China, the US and the UK among dozens of countries to sign the Paris agreement on the 2016 Earth Day.Denis Hayes speaking at a climate rally in Washington DC in 2010. Photograph: Brendan Hoffman/Getty ImagesSpeaking to the Guardian, Hayes acknowledged that many companies now use Earth Day as an opportunity for greenwashing, but added that the movement has also encouraged companies to change.“[Earth Day] is abused rather frequently. Of course, it’s particularly upsetting to me when it’s an event that I’ve had something to do with. I take some solace in the fact that I think relatively few people anywhere are motivated to accept the sentiment behind ‘Earth Day at Exxon’. It just doesn’t pass the giggle test,” he said.“In 1970, we were focusing on the fact that schoolchildren were not allowed to go outside for recess because the air was too filthy, that streams that people swam and fished in were no longer accessible because they were laced with poison, and we were spraying everything with pesticides. These were important but more local issues. Now, the big global issues like climate change and the epidemic of extinctions are more in tune with Earth Day, somewhat akin to the threat of thermonuclear war was when I was young,” he said.Corporate green claims are being increasingly scrutinised in the US, EU and the UK, with rules being tightened about what companies can say about the environmental credentials of their products and services. As well as encouraging genuine action to tackle the climate crisis, Earth Day has become a focal point for greenwashing.Plan to protect 30% of Earth divides and inspires at Cop15Read more“As early as 1990 when suddenly we were starting to get a fair amount of prominence once again, we had some of the most appalling clear cutters in the United States trumpeting their environmental credentials,” said Hayes. “We held a press conference to condemn their misuse of the name. In Houston, Enron actually sponsored a big Earth Day festival. It’s appalling but I can’t think of anything to do about it.“It has nothing to do with the original sentiments that we had, or the things that motivate millions of people every year to come out and do something positive for the environment,” he said.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"

        "text": "All toilet paper from across the globe checked for toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” contained the compounds, and the waste flushed down toilets and sent to sewage treatment plants probably creates a significant source of water pollution, new research has found.Once in the wastewater plant, the chemicals can be packed in sewage sludge that is eventually spread on cropland as fertilizer, or spilt into waterways.Artificial turf potentially linked to cancer deaths of six Phillies ball players – reportRead more“Toilet paper should be considered as a potentially major source of PFAS entering wastewater treatment systems,” the study’s authors wrote.PFAS are a class of about 14,000 chemicals typically used to make thousands of consumer products resist water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and they are linked to cancer, fetal complications, liver disease, kidney disease, autoimmune disorders and other serious health issues.The study checked 21 major toilet paper brands in North America, western Europe, Africa, Central America and South America, but it did not name the brands.The peer-reviewed University of Florida report did not consider the health implications of people wiping with contaminated toilet paper. PFAS can be dermally absorbed, but no research on how it may enter the body during the wiping process exists. However, that exposure is “definitely worth investigating, said David Andrews, senior scientist with the Environmental Working group, a public health non-profit that tracks PFAS pollution.Brands that used recycled paper had just as much PFAS as those that did not, and it may be that there is no avoiding PFAS in toilet paper, said Jake Thompson, the study’s lead author and a University of Florida grad student“I’m not rushing to change my toilet paper and I’m not saying that people should stop using or reduce the amount of toilet paper they use,” he added. “The issue is that we’re identifying another source of PFAS, and it highlights that the chemicals are ubiquitous.”The PFAS levels detected are low enough to suggest the chemicals are used in the manufacturing process to prevent paper pulp from sticking to machinery, Thompson said. PFAS are often used as lubricants in the manufacturing process and some of the chemicals are commonly left on or in consumer goods.In a statement to WSVN in Florida, a trade group representing the toilet paper industry said no PFAS is added to toilet paper. Thompson said “evidence seems to suggest otherwise” though it may be true that PFAS are not intentionally added.“Companies might not be aware that it’s used because it might come from the manufacturer of the instruments they use,” he said.Researchers detected six PFAS compounds, with 6:2 diPAP representing the highest levels. The compound has not been robustly studied, but is linked to testicular dysfunction. The study also found PFOA, a highly toxic compound, and 6:2 diPAP can turn into PFOA once in the environment.The average American uses 57 pounds of toilet paper a year and more than 19bn pounds of toilet paper flushed every year in the US. The study also checked wastewater at eight wastewater treatment plants and found it is likely that 6:2 diPAP in toilet paper represents much of the compound found in wastewater.However, PFAS are so common that it is difficult to pin their source with precision, which speaks to the larger issue around the chemicals’ widespread use, Thompson said.“As a society we have to decide what to do about this problem,” he said."

        "text": "The National Trust has raised concerns about “political pressure” and defended its right to lobby on nature amid a renewed campaign by a self-styled “anti-woke” group seeking to recruit Conservative MPs to its cause.The leadership of the UK’s largest charity is facing a fresh challenge at its annual meeting next month from the right-leaning Restore Trust group, whose candidates tried but failed to win seats on the National Trust’s 36-strong governing council last year.The Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg and the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage have shared social media attack adverts this year linked to the Restore Trust campaign.A veteran Tory party activist, who ran campaigns for Liz Truss and Boris Johnson, has also sent out invitations to join a WhatsApp group set up for MPs and peers.Restore Trust opposes what it describes as a “woke” agenda – including National Trust displays about slavery and historical figures – and has said it wants to steer the charity “back to its core purpose of looking after our heritage and countryside”. It has endorsed five candidates who are standing for election to its council.Most prominent among the Restore Trust-backed candidates is the former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption.As members of the charity prepare to cast their votes in the governing council election, the National Trust spoke of its concern about the role of paid Restore Trust adverts on Facebook and their dissemination by political figures on social media.“Our governance depends on independent citizens who are free from political influence, acting collectively in the best interests of this charity,” a spokesperson said. “Any political campaign to influence the governance of an independent charity would be concerning, and we are not the only charity coming under political pressure.“We are aware of [Restore Trust’s] attempts to organise support among MPs. We trust our members will make up their own minds, and vote in the best long-term interests of the National Trust and the nations we serve.”At an event at the Conservative party conference this week, the National Trust’s director general, Hilary McGrady, also defended its right to oppose policies, such as the government’s plans to scrap pollution rules for housebuilders, that would harm nature.McGrady herself has faced personal attacks online for her defence of nature. “I’ve got very thick skin these days,” she told the Guardian, adding: “But to be really clear, the National Trust was founded to actually look after green space.”She said: “All the way through our 128 years we have very consistently campaigned for the protection of the countryside as well as our houses and of course we don’t really see a distinction because our houses sit on our landscapes.”In the run-up to the trust’s next AGM, political figures have received emails from Andrew Kennedy, a former Conservative campaigner for Truss, Johnson and others, inviting them to sign up to briefings and join a Restore Trust WhatsApp group so social media graphics can be shared.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

While the charity continues to find itself in the eye of a “culture war”, polling last week by the thinktank More in Common found that public confidence in the charity rose in the past year.More than 70% of 2,000 adults polled said they trusted the National Trust, up seven points on last year. The same number regarded the organisation as a force for good, ahead of schools, the military and other sectors.Attempts were made to contact Restore Trust and Kennedy for comment."

None of the dolphins caught survived.Fifty-nine of the animals (26%) caught were species classified as either threatened or protected marine animals under Australian laws.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nBut the Humane Society International (HSI) said this figure grew to 162 (71%) when classifications under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the Convention on Migratory Species and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) were also factored in.“This data is not saying anything new – it’s saying the same thing it’s been saying for the past 10 years,” the marine biologist and HSI campaigner Lawrence Chlebeck said.“[The NSW government] should recognise this program is outdated and has an annual cost for our precious marine wildlife.”He said the government should “ditch the nets” and rely on methods it had invested in, such as smart drumlines, education and drone surveillance.Dr Leonardo Guida, a shark scientist at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said communities wanted modern-day “beach safety standards that improve safety for people and wildlife alike – solutions like drones and the tagging and tracking of animals”.“Public sentiment and the science are in alignment – come September, the NSW government should keep the nets out and the drones up,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The committee supported a change in management strategy.The government has said it will not make a decision on whether the nets will be rolled out until it hears from eight coastal councils.Waverley, which is home to some of Sydney’s most famous beaches including Bondi and Bronte, is one of four councils that told Guardian Australia it would advocate for an alternative to the shark meshing program.A NSW department of primary industries spokesperson said no beachgoers suffered “any injuries due to shark interactions at any meshed beaches in the 2022/23 meshing season”.“At this stage, no decisions have been made about the future deployment of shark mesh nets,” the spokesperson said. “A decision will be made by the NSW Government before the start of the 2023/24 swimming season and following the tender and council consultation processes.” The main image above this article was changed on 2 August 2023 to provide a more accurate representation of shark nets used on NSW surf beaches.

        "text": "A young humpback whale was freed by rescuers in Alaska after it was discovered hog-tied to a 300lb crab pot.The rescue, which occurred on 11 October, came after two local residents discovered the trapped whale a day earlier in the coastal waters near Gustavus, a city close to Glacier Bay national park in the southernmost part of Alaska. Researchers estimate the whale to be about three to four years old.The residents contacted the visitor information center at Glacier Bay national park and reported that a whale near the Gustavus dock was “trailing two buoys, making unusual sounds and having trouble moving freely”, the National Park Service said.In a press release issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Janet Neilson, an NPS whale biologist who was part of the rescue, said that park personnel located the whale from shore and confirmed that it was dragging two buoys.“They were able to get out on the water right away to confirm the entanglement and take photos of the animal and gear that helped paint a much more thorough picture,” she said.Rescue team members including NPS patrol teams and experts involved with the Large Whale Entanglement Response network were soon able to determine that the whale’s entanglement was “life threatening”, Noaa said in the release.The crew observed that the whale was swimming in a tight clockwise circle that “appeared to be intermittently anchored to the seafloor” by a 300lb crab pot with 450ft of heavy duty line, according to NPS.It added, the rescue team members were able to get in touch with the owner of the gear who said they had set the pot near Pleasant Island, which lies south-east of Gustavus. However, between Saturday and Sunday morning, the pot had gone missing, meaning that the whale had already been entangled for at least three days when residents reported the discovery, NPS said.Rescue team members were deployed on site the next day and used drone footage to collect aerial photographs and videos of the whale’s entanglement.00:00:40Drone footage shows humpback whale entangled in heavy crab line off Alaska – video“This was a complicated entanglement with a line through the whale’s mouth, and wrapped around the animal’s tail stock,” Fred Sharpe, advanced large whale entanglement responder with Alaska Whale Foundation, told the Noaa. “The drone imagery assisted tremendously with our understanding of the entanglement and how to prioritize our cutting attempts,” he added.The NPS said the whale was making 7-9-minute dives and was at the surface for only approximately 30 seconds.“The whale had a loop of line through its mouth that led to a large, heavy glob of tangled lines at its tail. In effect, the whale was hog-tied, its body bent sharply to the side as it swam in a predictable clockwise circle each time it came up. The whale also had a distinct healed scar across its back from being hit by a vessel’s propeller,” it said.The crew was eventually able to make cuts into the line using specialized tools designed to keep responders at a safe distance from the whale. One of the tools includes a knife on the end of a 25ft carbon fiber pole and grappling hooks modified with razor-sharp knife blades inside the grapple to cut as they grab, the Noaa said.“The turning point came when we were able to cut the rope that ran through the whale’s mouth and was wrapped around its tail,” said Chris Gabriele, a whale biologist with Glacier Bay national park who was part of the rescue efforts.Crews spent hours cutting away at the rope to free the whale.Officials with the whale entanglement response team plan to look for the whale in the coming weeks to document its condition if it is still in the area."

However, drivers in several EU countries have received fines, many totalling thousands of pounds, for failing to register their Ulez-compliant cars with TfL before driving into London.EU countries accuse TfL debt collectors of breaching data protection laws over London penalty finesRead moreSome have been penalised mistakenly under the separate low emissions zone (Lez) that covers heavy goods vehicles entering Greater London. One driver was fined nearly £11,000 after a three-day visit in a hire car.A Belgian court bailiff, acting for TfL’s collections agent Euro Parking Collection, is accused of abusing its legal powers to obtain more than 20,000 registered keeper details and pass them on to Euro Parking for UK enforcement. The bailiff has since had its official access to the vehicle licensing database suspended pending disciplinary proceedings while Belgian MPs have demanded their government take action to recover the money paid by drivers.Meanwhile, Dutch authorities have intervened after driver details were allegedly illegally obtained by an agent in Italy acting for Euro Parking and a group of 100 French drivers have begun a lawsuit claiming that their details were obtained unlawfully.According to Belgian MP Michael Freilich, who uncovered the alleged data abuse, Euro Parking is circumventing GDPR rules by employing EU based agents who obtain driver data on its behalf without disclosing it will be shared with a UK company. In correspondence seen by the Guardian, the Belgian bailiff was twice refused permission to use the vehicle licensing database for the purposes of Ulez enforcement.However, according to Freilich, the bailiff nonetheless used its official licence to obtain the details of drivers who were then issued with fines by Euro Parking Collection (EPC).“EPC should cease these operations immediately, if necessary, by government action,” he said. “Furthermore, they should be compelled to repay all of the ill-gotten gains.”The Dutch vehicle licensing agency, RDW, said in June it had launched an investigation after complaints from drivers who had received hefty fines after visiting London in emissions-compliant cars. It said there is no data-sharing agreement between the UK and the Netherlands for Ulez enforcement and it had released driver details to an agent in Italy, which had implied it was for enforcement within the EU.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It claimed that no Belgian data has been shared with EPC since 2022 when it was made aware that it was unlawful. However, the Guardian has been seen multiple fines issued to Belgian citizens this year.TfL said: “Any company working on our behalf is contractually required to ensure that data is processed in line with the relevant data protection legislation and no Belgian driver data has been shared with us or EPC since the ruling by the Belgian National Chamber of Judicial Officers came into effect.”"

Outdoor school events were delayed and city officials warned vulnerable groups to remain inside when possible. In the nation’s capital of Ottawa, Environment Canada said the air quality was “very high risk”, alongside the nearby cities of Kingston, Cornwall and Belleville. In much of southern Ontario, the poor air quality is expected to persist into the weekend.The bulk of the smoke in eastern Canada is coming from the province of Quebec, where crews are contending with more than 150 fires, many of which are considered “out of control”.smoke mapWinds have also carried the wildfire smoke southward, prompting air-quality alerts throughout the US. On Wednesday, both Detroit and New York City had some of the world’s worst air quality of a major city. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has previously issued poor air quality alerts for New England, parts of Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota.As of Tuesday afternoon, there were 415 active wildfires across Canada and 238 were considered out of control. Since the fire season began, 2,214 blazes have already burned more than 3.3m hectares of the country, well above the 10-year average of 1,624 fires and 254,429 hectares burned.The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre says it had been an “unprecedented” year for wildfires and resources were being exhausted across the country.While eastern Canada is under a relatively rare haze of smoke, crews in British Columbia are waiting for a shift in weather to tackle the Donnie Creek fire, a blaze stretching more than 2,400 sq km in size. The BC Wildfire Service says the wildfire is now considered the second largest in provincial history.Federal officials in Canada warned that without a change in weather, the country was on pace for its worst-ever year for wildfire destruction, pointing to warm and dry conditions that are forecasted to persist in all regions of the country throughout the summer.A firefighter directs water on a grass fire burning behind a residential property in Kamloops, British Columbia, on 5 June.

        "text": "The murders of the British journalist Dom Phillips and the Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira were not only a shocking and incalculable loss for their families and all those who loved them and admired their work. They were also a chilling reminder of the perils faced both by journalists and environmental defenders – particularly Indigenous peoples and those working with them – in Latin America.Seven months have passed since the men were killed in the Javari valley region of the Amazon. On Monday, Brazilian police announced that they had arrested the alleged mastermind. Rubens Villar Coelho, nicknamed Colômbia, was first detained on separate charges last July, when he denied any involvement in the crime. He has been accused of running an illegal fishing operation. Three other men are in custody over the deaths.Real justice for Mr Phillips and Mr Pereira would mean accountability not only for those who pulled the trigger, but for all those who have made the Amazon a dangerous place – police officers, businessmen or politicians who have turned a blind eye to depredations, or benefited from them. Journalists are at risk in many places, especially when they challenge powerful interests. This week, the Cameroonian journalist Martinez Zogo was found dead, after his abduction by unknown assailants. But they are in greatest danger in Latin America and the Caribbean, where 30, including Mr Phillips, were killed last year, according to a new report by the Committee to Protect Journalists – the highest figure ever, and double the number killed in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion. As the CPJ’s programme director, Carlos Martínez de la Serna, noted: “The cost of attacking or killing a journalist is extremely low … There is never justice.”Latin America is also the most dangerous region in the world for environmental protectors. A report by Global Witness last autumn found that of the 1,733 land and environmental defenders known to have been killed in the last decade, more than two-thirds died in Latin America, and almost two-fifths were Indigenous. The only thing they did wrong was getting in the way of those exploiting and destroying the natural world.Under Brazil’s last president, the far-right Jair Bolsonaro, agribusiness and extractive industries had free rein. The reduced state presence in the Amazon created not only opportunities for criminals, but also a sense that they were immune to consequences. Thankfully, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has pledged to undo the damage wreaked by his predecessor and work towards zero deforestation of the rainforest. On his first day in office he signed seven executive orders to protect the environment. He has appointed the country’s first minister for Indigenous peoples, Sônia Guajajara, and last week he met the Yanomami people in the Amazon state of Roraima, who have been enduring a humanitarian and health catastrophe after the invasion of their land by thousands of illegal miners.Marina Silva, the environment minister, has said that the “enraged mob” who launched the insurrection in Brasília earlier this month included pro-Bolsonaro militants with links to illegal deforestation, mining, land-grabbing and fishing, angry that their era of “guaranteed impunity” was over. There is suspicion that more powerful forces behind the riot share a similar agenda. The threat is not over, and taking on such ruthless opponents is risky. It is also, unquestionably, necessary."

        "text": "Time magazine has named Stormzy one of its “next generation leaders” in the US news weekly’s annual list of young trailblazers. The 26-year-old rapper appears on the cover of the magazine and was interviewed by the Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race author, Reni Eddo-Lodge.The rapper sits alongside Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, American actor Tessa Thompson and Spanish musician Rosalía on the list. Senegalese artist Selly Raby Kane, British-Somalian boxer Ramla Ali and South Korean gaming activist Kim “Geguri” Se-yeon also appear.Born Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr, Stormzy posted a picture of the cover on Instagram, writing: “I’ve stared at this cover for a few minutes and it feels like one of those, ‘How the fuckkkkk did man get here?!’ moments.”He continued: “Anyone who knows me knows how much I shy away from being anything other than ‘Mike’. The thought of being a ‘role model’ or ‘leader’ or whatever it is can often feel way way way too heavy and too overwhelming and a lot of the time … I can’t even bare [sic] the weight of being myself let alone any of these other titles.“I am deeply flawed and still learning how to be a man and still figuring out how to grow into the person I need to be but within all of that confusion and all the juggling of being a human and trying to be a superhuman – I have purpose. And my purpose has lead [sic] me here.‘I have a purpose’ … Stormzy on the cover of Time. Photograph: Time MagazineIn the interview, he expressed gratitude to his forerunners in the UK grime scene who had endured more explicit racism in the early 2000s, encountering demonisation from politicians and having their performances subject to scrutiny from the now-scrapped Form 696, which required promoters to detail the ethnicity of a performer’s audience.“I know I’m the product of bare injustice,” he said. “I feel like all those artists or public figures or celebrities who went through that, had to go through that … they didn’t have the luxury of being free with their music, and they had to bite that bullet for me.”Stormzy at Glastonbury 2019 review – a glorious victory lap for black British cultureRead moreHe described his headline slot at this year’s Glastonbury festival as “the pinnacle of my career, my defining moment”, and cited Beyoncé’s landmark Coachella set in 2018 as an influence: “Not in terms of anything to do with how it sounded or looked. Trying to imitate Beyoncé, that’s a fool’s game. Just in terms of quality, and impact.”Stormzy used his performance at the festival to shine a light on his peers, name-checking a long list of fellow UK rappers, from Wiley to Little Simz, and bringing out Dave and Fredo to perform their single Funky Friday. “I proper felt like I needed to do that,” he told Time. “There’s been this historical thing of letting one black person in at a time.”Explaining his partnership with Penguin – where his #Merky imprint publishes emerging British writers of colour – and the scholarship he established to support two black British students to go to Cambridge University, he said his purpose was to “shine a light where I can, do something where I can”."

        "text": "Rich countries are signing a “death sentence” for millions of poor people around the world by failing to phase out fossil fuels, the climate activist Greta Thunberg has told governments.She warned on Tuesday that with annual greenhouse gas emissions at an all-time high, only a “rapid and equitable” phaseout of fossil fuels would keep global temperatures within the scientifically advised limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.“The coming months and years – right now – will be crucial to what the future looks like. It is what we decide now that will define the rest of humanity’s future,” she told a press conference at UN talks in Bonn, where governments are meeting to discuss the climate crisis.“If we do not [phase out fossil fuels], it will be a death sentence for countless people. It is already a death sentence for countless people,” she said.Thunberg last Friday announced the end of her school strikes, which she has been undertaking on Fridays since 2018 in protest at political inaction on the climate crisis. The campaigner has left school but intends to carry on speaking out on climate issues, while also giving the spotlight to youth voices from the developing world.She said a lack of political will to halt fossil fuel exploration and use was threatening to raise global temperatures by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which could lead the climate to pass “tipping points”, a cascade of impacts that could create runaway global heating.“We are still rushing towards the cliff. We could trigger feedback loops that are beyond human control, that would throw countless billions under the bus,” she said.The question of phasing out fossil fuels is expected to be a flashpoint at the Cop28 UN climate talks later this year. The summit will take place in Dubai, hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a major oil and gas producer.Many countries would like to see Cop28 produce a formal resolution to phase out fossil fuels, or at least to discuss such a phaseout as an official agenda item at the summit. But some countries, chiefly fossil fuel producers including Saudi Arabia, are staunchly opposed, and the UAE presidency has been cautious, saying there is not yet agreement on the agenda.Chairing the talks will be Sultan Al Jaber, a minister in the UAE government who is also chief of the country’s national oil company, Adnoc, which is planning a massive expansion of fossil fuel production capacity.Eric Njuguna, a climate justice organiser from Kenya, speaking with Thunberg, said Al Jaber’s dual role was a conflict of interest, and called on him to resign. “It is a stab in the back for poor countries to have a fossil fuel CEO on top of efforts to constrain the climate crisis,” he said.Al Jaber has told the Guardian he will bring a “business mindset” to the talks, and pointed to his role as co-founder of the Masdar renewable energy company in UAE. He visited the Bonn talks last Thursday, and told a public meeting: “The phasedown of fossil fuels is inevitable.” But he stopped well short of promising to put a phaseout of fossil fuels on the Cop28 agenda.The talks in Bonn, which started last Monday and will end on Thursday, are to lay the groundwork for Cop28, the conference of the parties under the UN framework convention on climate change, which begins on 30 November.Progress at Bonn has been slow. Last week’s discussions were characterised by disputes over rich countries that are failing to provide financial assistance to developing countries, to help them cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of the climate crisis.Alden Meyer, a senior associate at the thinktank E3G, said: “Much more work remains to be done to land an agreement at Cop28 for a just and equitable reduction of fossil fuel production and use in a timeframe that’s consistent with the Paris [agreement] 1.5C goal.”"

At 200 barrels, it was a relatively small spill, but was leaking into the shallow coast close to environmentally sensitive areas. He said it had the potential to cause substantive damage before it dispersed and broke down.Poole harbour: major incident declared over leak from oilfield Read more“It will be important to collect as much of the oil as possible in the forthcoming hours and to boom off harbours and sensitive areas,” he said.The oil spill occurred at a pipeline operated by the gas company Perenco, at Wytch Farm oilfield. It showed that even with onshore drilling, “where there’s drilling, there’s spilling,” said Ian Williams, professor of applied environmental science at the University of Southampton.“Oil spills have a wide range of well-documented adverse impacts on land, oceans, coastlines, rivers, seabeds and more,” he said. “Oil has the potential to destroy habitats and disrupt the natural ecosystems that make up these environments. [Oil spills] are particularly damaging to areas that are sensitive or protected such as Poole harbour.”Location of leak in Poole harbourResearch by the University of Newcastle has revealed such oil spills are not isolated in the UK. Prof Richard Davies, pro-vice chancellor of the global and sustainability department, said the research found leakage from oil and gas well boreholes, and sometimes from the associated pipelines, had caused nine pollution incidents between 2000 and 2013, according to Environment Agency data.Caroline Dennett, who resigned as a safety consultant for Shell, which is not involved in this oilfield, after accusing the oil company of causing “extreme harms” to the environment, said the spill was environmentally devastating.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When this happens here it really brings home the impact.”The oil spill came a week after Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council voted to request the Dorset Pension Fund to divest from fossil fuels. Dennett said the spill should feed an appetite to put a stop to the Wytch Farm production site. “They only serve the global market and its greedy shareholders,” she said."

        "text": "‘This is no way to live’: Mississippians struggle with another water crisisRead moreEmergency measures are required to avert a catastrophe in Utah’s Great Salt Lake, which has been drying up due to excessive water use, a new report warns. Within years, the lake’s ecosystems could collapse and millions will be exposed to toxic dust contained within the drying lakebed, unless drastic steps are taken to cut water use.A team of 32 scientists and conservationists caution that the lake could decline beyond recognition in just five years. Their warning is especially urgent amid a historic western megadrought fueled by global heating. To save the lake, the report suggests 30-50% reductions in water use may be required, to allow 2.5m acre-feet of water to flow from streams and rivers directly into the lake over the next two years.“We really need to increase the speed of our response, and also increase our ambition for how much water we restore to the lake,” said Ben Abbott, an ecologist at Brigham Young University and one of the report’s lead authors.A couple walks along the receding edge of the Great Salt Lake. Photograph: Rick Bowmer/APDespite growing political momentum, Abbott said that existing policies and action plans will not be enough to save the lake from collapse. Already, the lake has lost 73% of its water and 60% of its surface area, as trillions of litres of water are diverted away from it to supply farms and homes. As a result, the lake is becoming saltier and uninhabitable to native flies and brine shrimp. Eventually, the lake will be unable to sustain the more than 10 million migratory birds and wildlife that frequent it.Declining lake levels could also make magnesium, lithium and other critical minerals extraction infeasible within the next two years. Dust from the exposed lakebed could further damage crops, degrade soil and cause snow to melt more quickly – triggering widespread economic losses for Utah’s agriculture and tourism industries. Toxic sediment, laced with arsenic, from the lakebed can exacerbate respiratory conditions and heart and lung disease, and could increase residents’ risk for cancer.Empty docks at the Antelope Island Marina due to record low water levels in August 2022.  Photograph: Rick Bowmer/AP“The last nail in the coffin is where we’re at,” said Kevin Perry, a University of Utah atmospheric scientist researching the Great Salt Lake dust. In parts of Utah that already suffer dangerous air quality in the summer and winter due to wildfire smoke and vehicle emissions, dust from the lake threatens to bring year-round pollution, Perry said.The climate crisis, which has increased average temperatures in northern Utah by 4F since the early 1900s, is further imperilling the lake, fuelling more severe droughts and heatwaves. But studies suggest that only about 9% of the lake’s decline due to evaporation and reduced runoff can be blamed on climate change.A legacy of water overuse is the main threat to the largest saltwater lake in the western hemisphere, and huge water diversions to irrigate vast operations to grow alfalfa and hay are no longer sustainable in Utah, Abbott said, nor are lush lawns in cities and suburbs.Reef-like structures called microbialites, exposed by receding waters, at the Great Salt Lake. Photograph: Rick Bowmer/APLast year, Utah’s legislature allocated $40m toward restoring the declining lake, and lawmakers at the state and federal level have committed to averting the public health risks posed by the shrinking lake. Joe Biden recently signed into law a defence bill with provisions proposed by the Utah senator Mitt Romney to monitor and address the Great Salt Lake crisis.“The only option to avert full collapse of the lake’s ecosystem is to save enough water fast enough,” Abbot said."

But even over-ripe fruit that’s no longer good to eat raw is delicious if poached and sat upon a glorious pavlova.Pavlova with quince, chocolate and hazelnutsOver-ripe fruit that is no longer palatable raw can be poached and served simply with breakfast cereal, porridge or yoghurt, or for dessert with cream. It can also be upcycled into this show-stopping zero-waste pavlova made with aquafaba instead of egg whites. The meringue is a sweet treat made by converting something that is usually wasted, namely aquafaba, into a dessert to die for – especially when topped with poached seasonal fruit and melted chocolate. This recipe is adapted from one in my cookbook Eating for Pleasure, People & Planet.For the meringue170ml aquafaba 1 tsp cream of tartar225g caster sugarFor the honey-poached quince250ml honey, or other sweetener (eg, sugar, maple syrup or date syrup)Zest and juice of 1 lemon½ cinnamon stick (optional)2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)500g quince, or other ripe seasonal fruitFor the topping100g good-quality dark chocolate250ml double cream100g hazelnuts, toastedPut the aquafaba in a ceramic bowl and beat on high speed for five minutes, until it forms stiff peaks. Whisk in the cream of tartar, if using, and caster sugar, a third at a time, until the mix forms very stiff peaks.Spread the meringue into a roughly 20cm-wide disc on a large baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper, then bake in a 130C (110C fan)/260F/gas ¾ oven for three hours. Turn off the oven, keep the door closed and leave the meringue to cool down for at least two more hours.Meanwhile, put 800ml water in a large pan with the honey (or other sweetener) and the lemon zest and juice, and add the half-stick of cinnamon and vanilla extract, if using. Core the quinces, then chop into wedges, dropping them into the pan as you go (quince skin is fine to eat). Bring the pot up to a gentle simmer and leave to cook for about two hours (alternatively, to save energy, cook in a slow cooker for four to five hours). Lift out the quince pieces and set aside to cool, then, if need be, bring the remaining liquid to a boil, reduce to a syrup and leave to cool.Break the chocolate into small pieces, put these in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of hot, just-simmering water, and stir to melt.Put the meringue on a platter, top with the whipped double cream and pieces of quince, drizzle over the chocolate sauce and finish with a scattering of toasted hazelnuts."

Hormonally active cancers are common and hard to cure, making deeper inquiry into potential environmental causes critical, the researchers said.“People should care about this because we know that there is widespread human exposure to these chemicals and we have documented data on that,” said Max Aung, assistant professor of environmental health at the USC Keck School of Medicine and a senior author of the study.“These chemicals can increase the risk of various different health outcomes and they can alter your biological pathways … That is important to know so that we can better prevent exposures and mitigate risks,” Aung said.It’s nearly impossible to avoid exposure to PFAS, because the chemicals are so widespread in the environment. Sometimes called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, PFAS residues can persist in water, soil, air and food. An estimated 97% of Americans have PFAS in their blood, according to the CDC. The US Geological Survey (USGS), a unit of the US Department of Interior, says that 45% of US drinking water is contaminated with PFAS.Notably, the research team found differences in women from different racial groups – links between PFAS and ovarian and uterine cancers were seen mainly in white women, while associations between chemicals known as phenols and breast cancer were seen largely in non-white women.The researchers said it was not clear exactly why such differences exist, but could be due to dietary habits and proximity to contaminated drinking water sources, among other factors.The new study is based on analysis of data collected through a CDC biomonitoring program from 2005 to 2018 involving more than 10,000 people. Researchers looked at prior cancer diagnoses and levels of PFAS and phenols in blood and urine collected from study participants.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Researchers said they also found a link between PFNA and uterine cancer.The work does not prove that exposure to PFAS and phenols led to these cancer diagnoses, the researchers said, but is a strong sign that the chemicals play a role and should be studied further.The study is part of ongoing research funded by the National Institutes of Environmental Health to “better understand” how PFAS chemicals are affecting human health. There are thousands of different types of PFAS, and research on their health effects is still evolving, though certain types of PFAS have already been linked through prior scientific research to multiple health problems including cancer, decreased fertility and kidney disease.In addition to Aung, the study was conducted by researchers affiliated with the Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment at the University of California, San Francisco; the University of Southern California; and the University of Michigan.

        "text": "The olive oil industry is “in crisis”, and the heatwave in southern Europe is threatening to inflict the second bad harvest in a row and gaps on shelves this autumn.After a spring heatwave affected flowering in Spain, which produces about half of the global olive crop, the harvest was forecast to be only 28% up on last year, which was the worst in almost a decade.The International Olive Oil Council predicted that the country would produce 850,000 tonnes, compared with 1.3m tonnes in a typical year and just 660,000 last year. That forecast was issued before the current period of high temperatures.The industry fears that production could end up being even worse as a second heatwave in a week brings temperatures of up to 43C this week to some southern parts of Spain, prompting trees to drop unripe fruits in order to preserve moisture.A graphic showing olive oil production in Spain and rest of the EU“In Spain we already know it is going to be another bad year, but no one has got to grips with the what’s currently happening. The record temperatures are not going to help the situation,” said Walter Zanre, the chief executive of the UK arm of Filippo Berio, the world’s largest olive oil producer.“I can’t share how much anxiety this is causing us. Last year, Spain came into crop with a bit of carry-over [from the year before], which negated the shortfall somewhat. This year the barrels are dry. Even if Spain produces the predicted 850,000 tonnes, the price situation is worse.”Zanre said that the probable shortages meant prices were likely to rise further amid similarly poor harvests in Italy and Portugal. Wholesale prices have doubled since the beginning of 2022. In the UK, the retail price of olive oil was up 47% year on year to an average £6.16 for 500ml in May, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.Given that the autumn harvest is unlikely to produce new oil until November and that last year’s supplies are expected to run out by September, at present rates of consumption, it is possible that supermarkets could see shortages in the autumn.Tomato producers in Italy are also concerned about the impact of the heatwave, after flooding wiped out more than 15% of the crop planted this year. If the extreme temperatures in the country last longer than a few days, they could damage the remaining crops, which are almost ready for harvest.Diego Pariotti, the commercial director for exports at Conserve Italia, which produces the Cirio brand of tinned tomatoes and passata, said the group was estimating that production would be down by just 10%, with this year’s second harvest in August more likely to be affected by this week’s heatwave.But Pariotti added that the almost ripe fruits waiting to be picked in the coming weeks could also be at risk of damage if Italy’s heatwave, in which temperatures have exceeded 40C, continued for more than a few days. “Mature fruit can be burned,” he said. “There’s a worry for sure.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is not too extreme to say that olive oil is an industry in crisis. Although the prices are very high, nobody is getting rich,” he said.Fears for the future have grown as the climate crisis worsens. Filippo Berio has widened the areas it sources olives from, turning to countries such as Turkey and even Chile in order to supplement supplies from traditional growing regions such as Italy, Greece and Spain."

        "text": "Grey whales have learned to approach whale-watching boats to have parasites removed by human beings, it has been claimed.Video footage documenting the behaviour in the Ojo de Liebre lagoon, off the coast of Baja California, Mexico, shows a grey whale having whale lice picked off its head by the captain of a small boat. “I have done it repeatedly with the same whale and others,” Paco Jimenez Franco told a US news site. “It is very exciting for me.”Whale lice or cyamids – pale, crab-like creatures that crawl about on the animal’s heads – can be beneficial for whales, eating algae on their bodies and feeding on flaking skin and the sites of wounds. However, it is assumed that they also irritate the animal.“I think the grey whales have a love-hate relationship with their whale lice,” said Mark Carwardine, a British zoologist with wide experience in the region. “They have very sensitive skin, and thousands of these little creatures holding on tight, or moving about, with their exceedingly sharp, recurved claws, must drive them nuts.”He added: “It can actually hurt when a whale louse grabs hold of your finger – it feels like tiny pinpricks.”00:01:04A grey whale approaches a whale-watching boat and has lice picked off – videoFranco picked a louse off the head of the whale the first time it came close enough for him to do so. “Once I removed the first one, she approached again so that I could continue,” he said. The same individual whale has returned repeatedly for more “grooming”, according to Franco.Like many of the relatively slow-moving great whales, including humpbacks and right whales, grey whales – which can grow up to 15 metres (50ft) in length – are particularly susceptible to parasites. They also acquire barnacles as they graze on minute amphipods at the silty bottom of the sea.The grey whales off Baja California are celebrated for their inquisitive behaviour towards boats, even though they were hunted drastically in the 20th century. They were known to whalers as “devil fish” on account of their ferocity in fighting back against hunters, whose tactics included killing a nursing female’s calf to ensure the adult came close enough to be harpooned. The whale’s only other predator is the orca.While he could not confirm that approaching humans for delousing help constituted new behaviour in whales, Carwardine said he had not seen it before. “The whales certainly don’t seem to mind when people pick them off, although you’d have to pick off hundreds to make much of a difference,” he said.Ships are turning whales into ‘ocean roadkill’. This AI system is trying to stop itRead moreBecause the lice eat sloughed whale skin and damaged tissue, he noted that “rather than parasites, they are really what we call symbionts – in other words, each animal benefits from the other”.The new grooming behaviour could be considered similarly symbiotic. Given that grey whales can live for at least 80 years, it is possible that animals that were alive during the period of hunting have since adapted to benefit from interaction with humans."

        "text": "Life in the ocean’s twilight zone is expected to face dramatic declines and even extinction as seas warm and less food reaches the dimly lit waters, a study has found.The twilight zone lies between 200 metres and 1,000 metres below the surface and is home to a variety of organisms and animals, including specially adapted fish such as lantern sharks and kite fin sharks, which have huge eyes and glowing, bio-luminescent skin.Twilight zone animals feed on billions of tonnes of organic matter, such as dead phytoplankton and fish poo, which drifts down from the ocean’s surface. The drifting particles are known as marine snow.Record ocean temperatures put Earth in ‘uncharted territory’, say scientistsRead moreWarmer waters were in effect reducing the quantity of food that sunk down to the zone, meaning up to 40% of life in the twilight waters could be gone by the end of the century, according to the study, which was published in Nature. Recovery could take thousands of years.“The rich variety of twilight zone life evolved in the last few million years, when ocean waters had cooled enough to act rather like a fridge, preserving the food for longer and improving conditions allowing life to thrive,” said Katherine Crichton, the study’s lead author and a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Exeter.“According to the studies we have done, 15m years ago there wasn’t all this life [in the twilight zone] and now, because of human activity, we may lose it all. It’s a huge loss of richness,” Crichton told the Guardian. “Unless we rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, this could lead to the disappearance or extinction of much twilight zone life within 150 years, with effects spanning millennia thereafter.”Warmer oceans also reduced carbon storage, said Cardiff University’s Paul Pearson, the principal investigator on the study. This is because the “carbon that is sinking down as part of the marine snow” is eaten mostly by microbes nearer the surface, instead of falling further. Less sinking means a faster carbon release.Crichton said the good part about the studywas that “we don’t seem to have reached an irreversible point. We can’t avoid some loss, but we can avoid the worst if we control emissions.”Although poorly understood, the twilight zone “contains possibly the world’s largest and least exploited fish stock, and recycles [about] 80% of the organic material that sinks”, according to a UN programme that studies the region.Crichton said: “We still know relatively little about the ocean twilight zone, but using evidence from the past we can understand what may happen in the future.” Her team’s findings suggested “significant changes may already be under way”.The study offered three possible futures for the twilight zone: a low-carbon scenario, which allows for a total of 625bn tonnes of emissions from 2010 onward; a medium scenario, which allows for 2,500bn tonnes; and a high one, allowing for 5,000bn tonnes. “If we get to the medium or high scenario both are very bad news for the twilight zone,” Crichton said.To put the emission figures in context, the University of Exeter-led Global Carbon Budget estimated that in 2022, total global CO2 emissions reached 40.6bn tonnes. Emissions have been close to 40bn tonnes every year from 2010-22, so most of the CO2 in the study’s low-carbon scenario has already been emitted."

        "text": "African leaders have called for debt relief across the continent to allow countries to get on with responding to the climate crisis, as they publish the Nairobi declaration at the end of the first African climate summit.The declaration, which had a heavy focus on climate finance, also included a call for global carbon taxes, and for increased representation of African and other countries in the governance of multilateral banks.But delegates and campaign groups were critical of the spotlighting of climate finance across the event which, they said, came at the expense of issues such as adaptation and climate insecurity, at a time when extreme weather events across the continent have disrupted livelihoods, prompted displacement and worsened food insecurity.“Many communities bearing the brunt of increasing floods and droughts, while also at risk of conflict, are disappointed there wasn’t more emphasis on ensuring that green investments trickle down to them,” said Nazanine Moshiri, a climate, environment and conflict analyst for Africa at the International Crisis Group.Campaign groups also opposed leaders’ plans to scale up carbon markets projects on the continent, through the African carbon markets initiative launched during Cop27 last year.“The first ever African climate summit ended with a weak and inadequate declaration and [it is] clear that old colonial attitudes from global north continue to dictate Africa’s climate policy, imposing failed and dangerous carbon markets on the continent,” read a statement by a civil society network convening as the Africa people’s climate assembly.“There’s been a significant shift in the leadership’s approach to matters climate change,” said Ali Mohamed, Kenya’s special adviser for climate change, who believes the plans outlined in the declaration will be “groundbreaking”, and lauded plans to pursue private climate investments more aggressively.Some African leaders believe that carbon markets will have enormous economic potential, and may increase the climate funds available to the continent.But campaigners raised concerns over the “commodification” and extraction of Africa’s natural resources and “greenwashing”, and said the projects allowed western companies and countries to continue polluting. They argued that they were sidelined before and during the conference.Rights groups also said the summit was a missed opportunity to address human rights concerns surrounding renewable energy projects in Kenya and elsewhere on the continent, where installations have been linked with allegations of rights violations, loss of livelihood and violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples, according to reports by the Business and Human Rights Resource Center.“The declaration itself is very silent on human rights,” said Joab Okanda, Christian Aid’s pan-African advocacy adviser, who convened the joint protests against the summit. “A just energy transition should have human rights at the centre.”The summit’s call for the continent to pursue a “green growth” pathway received wide support among leaders and climate groups. “Renewable energy could be the African miracle but we must make it happen. We must all work together for Africa to become a renewable energy superpower,” António Guterres, the UN secretary general, told the conference.UAE, the country hosting the upcoming Cop28 summit in November, pledged $4.5bn (£3.5bn) to boost renewable energy on the continent. Sultan Al Jaber, the president of the summit, told the meeting that “the world is losing the race to meet its climate change goals”."

        "text": "During the lead-up to Christmas, temperatures in the US remained subfreezing for several days, leading to some deep snow accumulations. Although many people had a white Christmas, loved ones were kept apart due to road closures and cancelled flights as people were advised to stay at home.Power outages affected multiple states, leaving many without electricity or heating and making contact with friends and family even more difficult over the festive period.Thankfully, this cold spell is coming to an end, as temperatures are expected to rise to about 5C above average across much of the central US by midweek. This fast change in conditions is linked to a combination of a northerly shift in the jet stream, a change in the position of the low-pressure system that was sitting across eastern Canada over the past week or so, and south-westerly surface winds bringing warmer air poleward from the Gulf of Mexico.However, the speed of the change in temperatures may lead to some localised flooding, as snow accumulations begin to melt, creating further hazards and obstacles for locals and the emergency services to end the year.Parts of Europe are also forecast to experience some warmer-than-average conditions over the new year period. Like the US, there will be a northwards shift in the jet stream, which, accompanied by a large area of high pressure over the Mediterranean, will allow warmer, tropical air to take hold over most of the continent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Britain and Ireland hold about 8% of the global population.The roseate tern population has soared by 152% since the last census, due to the protection of nest sites and work to reduce predation by non-native species.The census, which was led by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) with more than 20 partner organisations, found big variations in trends by region.In Scotland, 14 out of 20 breeding seabird species were found to be in decline, whereas in England eight species increased, six declined and five were stable. In Wales, 11 were increasing while six were in decline, and in Northern Ireland, seven were increasing with four in decline.Seabirds were doing best around the Republic of Ireland coastline, with 15 species increasing and only two declining.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "In 2020, about 600 metres (2,000ft) down in an underwater canyon off the coast of Western Australia, scientists encountered a long gelatinous creature suspended in a giant spiral. “It was like a rope on the horizon. You couldn’t miss it,” says Nerida Wilson from the Western Australian Museum. “It was so huge.”It was a deep-sea siphonophore, a relative of the portuguese man o’ war, or blue bottles, that bob like party balloons on the sea surface, trailing deadly tentacles through the water. This one was probably a new species from the genus Apolemia, a group that generally look like tangled feather boas.Q&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world’s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth – and how much there is to protect. Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The spiral arrangement is known to be a feeding posture in these types of siphonophores. Numerous stinging tentacles create a wall of death in the water, trapping small prey, including crustaceans and fish.Finding it was one of the chance encounters that are common in deep-sea research. The scientists’ aim was to study life on the deep seabed, and they just happened to come across this floating jelly while their submersible was on its two-hour transit back to the ship, the research vessel Falkor, then run by the Schmidt Ocean Institute.Screens in different parts of the Falkor were transmitting live footage from the submersible. Wilson describes how everyone onboard was simultaneously mesmerised and puzzled when the enormous spiral came into view. They all swarmed into the control room to get a better look. “It was such a beautiful energy,” says Wilson. “Everyone was like, ‘What is this?’”Cameras on the remotely operated submersible captured the enormous Apolemia siphonophore in a feeding spiral shape. Photograph: ROV SuBastian/Schmidt Ocean InstituteTime was already short because the dive had run over schedule, and so the submersible pilot, controlling it from the surface, could only spend a few moments with the animal. “We circled around, took some footage and a little sample of tissue,” Wilson says. “Then we just had to go on our merry way.”Siphonophores look like jellyfish, and they do belong to the same group of animals, but they build their bodies in a unique way – more like hundreds of tiny jellyfish stuck together. Yet, a siphonophore is a single organism. “It did have two parents,” says Wilson. “It was a product of sex.”Rather than growing in a more conventional way into a body with organs that carry out different functions, siphonophores consist of individual parts called zooids. Some zooids are responsible for feeding, some for reproduction, and others move and steer the animal through the water. “They’re just an example of doing things a bit differently,” says Wilson. “They’re one and they’re many.”Discovered in the deep: the sharks that glow in the darkRead moreBased on a rough calculation from the submersible’s track, the spiral-shaped siphonophore is a candidate for the longest specimen ever encountered. At about 45 metres (150ft), it could even be the longest animal ever to be measured, much longer than a blue whale.Reluctant to claim any world records just yet, Wilson is working with a specialist in photogrammetry to get a more accurate estimate of the siphonophore’s size. It is not an easy task to extract three-dimensional information from the video, because the siphonophore moved about in the wake of the submersible’s thrusters. “Normally with photogrammetry, you’re going back and forth over a fixed object,” Wilson says. “This is technically a bit more challenging.”"

Neighbouring countries registered record temperatures during a heatwave in Asia in April.Vietnam’s record was measured indoors at Hoi Xuan station in northern Thanh Hoa province on Saturday, the National Centre for Hydro Meteorological Forecasting said, breaking the 2019 record of 43.4C.Nguyen Thi Lan, a farmer, said temperatures in the central city of Danang had forced workers to start their days earlier than ever. “We have had to finish before 10am to avoid the heat,” she said.Vietnam’s weather varies from north to south, but the country as a whole is now entering its hottest summer months.“This is a worrying record in the context of climate change and global warming,” Nguyen Ngoc Huy, a climate change expert, said from the capital, Hanoi. “I believe this record will be repeated many times.

        "text": "The UK government has proposed “feeble” new restrictions on harmful bottom trawling within 13 marine parks in England that would only actually ban it in three, campaigners say.Under the proposals put forward by Thérèse Coffey, the environment secretary, three out of the 13 marine protected areas (MPAs) would introduce whole-site bans on the environmentally destructive practice of bottom trawling. The other 10 would introduce partial bans in certain areas, mostly reefs and rocks where trawling is unlikely to occur anyway. England has 40 offshore marine protected areas in total.The measures follow a ban last June on bottom trawling at Dogger Bank, the UK’s largest sandbank and an important site for many marine species, as well as three other marine parks. The latest proposals – to introduce bylaws to restrict or ban bottom-towed gear in a further third of England’s marine parks – are part of the government’s wider consultation on the impact of fishing in MPAs.An aerial view of Doggerbank, where a ban on bottom trawling was introduced last June. Photograph: Nasa“Today’s plans will deliver more crucial safeguards for vital biodiversity and help restore England’s marine ecosystems,” Coffey said. “We will listen carefully to the responses so that we can help habitats and species recover while ensuring we have a sustainable and successful fishing industry for years to come.”Ocean campaigners, who want bottom trawling and other destructive fishing banned in all the UK’s MPAs, described the proposals as “too slow and piecemeal” to match the urgency of the ocean crisis. Trawling and dredging is currently permitted in the majority of these protected area, leading them to be dubbed “paper parks”.Charles Clover of Blue Marine Foundation said: “This announcement is feeble and depressing. A protected area should at the very least be protected from damaging activity.”Ariana Densham, head of oceans at Greenpeace, said: “This is a step forward for UK marine protection but progress remains way too slow in the face of the industrial fishing frenzy. This is all too piecemeal to meet the scale of the threat to our oceans. If the UK government wants to keep calling itself a global leader in marine protection, it needs to start by delivering 30x30 at home,” referring to the goal of protecting 30% of the land and ocean by 2030.In December, a report by Greenpeace showed more than 90% of the UK’s MPAs do not have site-wide protection against the most destructive fishing, and that just five out of 76 offshore sites are protected against bottom-towed gear. It concluded the UK was “an alarmingly long way” from realising its stated commitment of 30x30.Greenpeace and Oceana want to see bottom trawling and other destructive fishing banned as a condition of a fishing vessel’s licence.In December, the government issued more than 1,500 fishing licenses for EU vessels, allowing them to bottom trawl in most MPAs, Oceana said.Hugo Tagholm, executive director of Oceana UK, said: “Shockingly, in the wake of the UN biodiversity conference commitments to protect 30% of land and sea, the UK Government has just issued over 1,500 fishing licenses for EU vessels for 2023, which would permit them to bottom trawl in most offshore UK marine protected areas.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "About 20 specially bred wildcats are being released at secret locations in the Scottish Highlands by conservationists hoping to save the species from extinction in the UK.The animals were raised in captivity at a wildlife park in the Cairngorms as part of a breeding programme run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, which is expected to release up to 60 cats into the wild over the next three years.It is the first time a predatory mammal such as the wildcat has been officially released in the UK, and if successful will increase calls for Eurasian lynx to be introduced in Scotland – more than 1,000 years after they were hunted to extinction.The captive breeding programme was set up after Scotland’s wildcat population was on the cusp of being declared genetically extinct in the wild in 2019 because of habitat loss and interbreeding with feral domestic cats.Detection dogs taught newt tricks in bid to improve conservationRead moreThe International Union for Conservation of Nature said the wild population was “no longer viable”. It estimated as few as 30 were living in the wild in Scotland. “The number of wildcats is too small, the hybridisation too far advanced and the population too fragmented,” it said.Although the cats, which feed on mice, voles and rabbit, have been carefully acclimatised using animals raised in captivity in the Cairngorms, ecologists still worry they face major survival challenges.Local people including gamekeepers, who may fear wildcats could eat grouse and pheasant chicks, have been educated about wildcat living habits.The project has also heavily monitored feral and domestic cats in the release area, with 100 camera traps locating cats, which are then trapped and if necessary vaccinated and neutered to avoid hybridisation with wildcats.The wildcats have been released in the Cairngorms national park wearing satellite tracking collars so they can be carefully monitored and supervised.Dr Helen Senn, the project leader and head of science and conservation programmes for the RZSS, said that eventually wildcats raised or trapped on mainland Europe could be included in the release scheme.“We hope that this project will pave the way for the full recovery of Scotland’s last remaining native cat species,” she said.“Unfortunately, life is tough for wild carnivores and the sad reality is that some of the wildcats that we release will not survive due to threats such as road traffic. Their survival is contingent on their individual behaviour in a new environment.“However, we also know that inaction will result in extinction. As human activity is responsible for the wildcat’s decline, we have a responsibility to take action now to protect one of our rarest and most threatened mammals.”Francesca Osowska, the chief executive of NatureScot, the government conservation agency, said the project sat within a wider mosaic of species reintroduction and rewilding projects.“A huge amount of work has laid the ground for these wildcat releases, and we’re proud to have played our part in that. Our research shows that wildcats are facing extinction in Scotland, which makes conservation translocations like this a vital tool for the species’ recovery,” she said.“The newly released wildcats will face significant challenges as they seek to establish themselves, so it’s crucial we continue to do everything we can to give them the best chance to survive, and thrive, in Scotland.”"

        "text": "Reefs made from sunken trees can help restore biodiversity in degraded marine habitats, scientists have found.It is estimated that coral reefs support about 25% of all marine life. They provide housing, food and areas to spawn for millions of marine species and are the backbone of maintaining the aquatic life cycle.Since the 1950s, more than half of natural coral reefs have been lost to climate change, which has had dire effects on marine biodiversity. Experts estimate that if nothing is done to reduce biodiversity loss, more than a million species globally will be at risk of going extinct.To combat this, scientists have been developing methods to revive aquatic communities. The latest method involved sinking artificial reefs made from pear trees in the Wadden Sea in the Netherlands.A team of researchers built dozens of pyramid-shaped structures made out of felled pear trees, sank them to the seabed and monitored them for more than six months.Jon Dickson, a PhD candidate at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research and lead author of the study published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, said: “We have fossil records of sunken wood communities dating back to the Jurassic period … we are trying to simulate what it used to be like. [Because] trees are cheap and waste products, it’s cheaper to scale than using concrete or sunken ships.”Dickson and colleagues found that after six months the tree reefs were home to algae and more than 15 sessile organisms – species that are immobile and typically anchored to a surface, like barnacles on the hull of a ship.They also found that the sites with tree reefs were home to three times more species of fish than control areas without.These findings suggest that certain marine habitats could be recovered through the use of these tree reefs.“Hopefully we can push the knowledge that we’ve learned into other similar systems, [such as] in the North Sea … and help the fish population recover there,” Dickson said.In 2017, researchers in Germany published similar findings after studying deep sea organisms that inhabited sunken tree logs. They found that different species were attracted to the sunken wood depending on the location.Dickson said: “I’d love to do [this experiment] somewhere with clearer water where we can actually visually observe how these reefs are providing habitat for fish and other organisms, as well as elsewhere in the Netherlands and North Sea.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

You also have different [types of] trees in different places. So is that affecting what’s going on there?”Since the initial results were recorded last year, Dickson and colleagues have continued to monitor the tree reefs in the Wadden Sea and seen changes to their inhabitants, including the addition of fish eggs.“I’m really hopeful that we can kickstart the formation of natural reefs again by creating biodegradable reefs. [In] the southern North Sea there used to be 30% oyster reefs, now it’s less than 1%,” he said.“I feel like we’re at the point in this global biodiversity crisis where we need to accept that we don’t know all the answers and just start doing it on a wide scale [because] some action is better than no action.”"

        "text": "Scotland’s heritage agency plans to introduce an admission fee at the neolithic Calanais standing stones, one of the most popular and revered cultural sites in the Hebrides.The fee proposal coincides with a £6m revamp of Calanais visitor facilities being built in response to a surge in tourism to the Western Isles, driven largely by day trips by cruise ship passengers.Historic Environment Scotland said it would soon ask Scottish government ministers to approve its proposal for a fee, a move that it expects will provoke heavy criticism and resistance.The move would put Calanais on a par with other famous neolithic sites such as Skara Brae, the subterranean coastal village on Orkney exposed by a winter storm in 1850. Initially free to visit, the village was enclosed behind a fence with entry controlled through a visitor centre that charges up to £12.50 for adults. However, Orkney’s Ring of Brodgar stone circle remains open and free to all.Ian Fordham, the chair of Urras nan Tursachan (UnT), which owns the Calanais visitor centre and backs the fee proposal, said there was an urgent need to tackle the impact of increasing visitor numbers at the site.He said about 120,000 tourists a year visited Calanais and that figure was expected to nearly double by 2035. They are braced for an increase in daytrippers after a new deep water port for very large cruise ships opens in Stornoway next year.About 120,000 tourists a year visit Calanais. Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianAt present, the site is managed by UnT, which runs the visitor centre, and HES, which owns the standing stones and allows free admission through unlocked gates. They plan to build a larger visitor centre and fence in the site to make it a “single coherent visitor destination” with an entrance fee.The proposal to merge it into a single site has already been approved by the UK and Scottish governments under the islands growth deal.Fordham said they needed much better management of the site otherwise it would be “overrun in an uncontrollable fashion” by visitors.He said problems at the Ring of Brodgar, which had to be closed for some time to build new paths and drains to cope with its surge in visitors, was a warning of what could happen at Calanais.“With increasing footfall at the stones, there’s increasing risk of conservation damage, conservation risk to the stones,” he said. “It has become clear this year that increased visitors numbers are causing conservation issues at the stones, [in terms of] erosion.”Malcolm McLean, a former chair of the UN-linked cultural body Unesco Scotland who has been visiting Calanais for 40 years, said he was “acutely aware” of the need to safeguard archaeological sites but an entrance fee would dismay local people.“It will be a highly controversial decision on the island,” he said. “From a community perspective, people see this as a place that’s open and they can come and go at any time.” Many would find it “very difficult to deal with” if it was fenced in as a paying attraction, he said.The stones are thought to have been a ritual site for about 2,000 years. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThe Calanais stones were erected from about 2900BC onwards, predating the stone circle at Stonehenge, and are made up of a central stone circle to which a cruciform arrangement of stones was later added.Set on high ground, the site boasts views over the surrounding moorland and across Loch Roag on the west coast of Lewis.The stones are thought to have been a ritual site for approximately 2,000 years. A chambered cairn was added about 500 years after the first stones were erected.Some archaeologists believe some of the stones were erected deliberately to align with the midsummer sunrise on Lewis. A theory that they aligned too with the full moon’s movements was popularised by the amateur archaeologist Margaret Curtis, who died in 2020.The admission fee proposal was approved by HES’s board earlier this year and board members said it could set a precedent for other sites – an indication that charging could be imposed on other attractions. “Careful consideration is required over how the local community is engaged in this process,” the board said."

One paper, from 2018, suggests orcas near industrialised areas could be at risk of population collapse as a result.For the latest report, scientists examined postmortem records and tissue samples from 1,000 marine mammals, consisting of 11 different species stranded in the UK, using data collected over 30 years by a partnership including ZSL’s Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme, a government-funded project, and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science.They found that concentrations of PCBs, once widely used but banned globally in 2004 under the Stockholm convention, were highest in long-lived species at the top of the food chain: orcas, bottle-nosed dolphins and white-beaked dolphins.Researchers said they controlled for the bias introduced by examining stranded animals, whose deaths may have been hastened by chemicals, by including a high percentage of deaths from trauma, such as boat strikes or entanglement with fishing lines.Orcas following a trawler off the Shetland Isles, Scotland. Strandings may be exacerbated by high levels of PCBs in their bodies. Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyThe toxins, initially taken up by plankton at the bottom of the food chain and not susceptible to being broken down, increase in concentration the higher up the chain they go, a process known as “biomagnification”, Williams said.In 2017, Lulu, an orca from the UK’s last resident pod, was found dead on Tiree in Scotland. She was discovered to have one of the highest concentrations of toxic pollutants ever found in a marine mammal. The extreme level of PCBs in her blubber, at 950mg/kg (0.033oz/2.2lb) – more than 100 times the limit of 9mg/kg regarded as safe – was believed by some scientists to have contributed to her infertility.Race is on to rid UK waters of PCBs after toxic pollutants found in killer whaleRead more“This is a huge wake-up call,” said Williams, who called for urgent action to protect the marine environment from historical and emerging pollutants. “We rely on the same ecosystem for some of our own food – so these findings ring alarm bells not only for the future of marine life but indicate a risk to human health also.”The NHS advises pregnant and breastfeeding women, those trying to get pregnant and girls to eat no more than two portions of oily fish a week, because chemical pollutants may build up and affect the future development of a baby in the womb."

The lawsuit also called on the courts to require the province to draw up a new climate plan.In her judgment, Vermette found the youth “make a compelling case that climate change and the existential threat that it poses to human life” are clear and that the province’s climate plan “falls severely short” of what’s needed to address climate change.But she was skeptical that weaknesses in Ontario’s climate plan violated section 7 of Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees the right to life, liberty and security.Vermette also dismissed the idea that Ontario’s plan violated section 15 of the charter, which recognizes the right to equality under the law without discrimination.While she agreed climate change disproportionately affects certain groups, the province was not obliged to fix this inequality through its climate targets.The dismissal is a blow to attempts by young people to hold governments to account, and is the latest lawsuit of its kind to fail. In 2020, the federal court dismissed a separate lawsuit by another group of young people against Ottawa over its climate plan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Previous climate cases in Canada that alleged charter breaches have been rejected because they were not justiciable.“The decision includes a damning indictment of the Ontario government’s inadequate and dangerous climate target which puts people in the province on a collision course with the harmful and deadly impacts of climate change,” the group said in a statement, adding it would appeal the ruling to the province’s higher court.“The fight to hold the Ontario government accountable for its climate action is not over.”"

Bureaucratic bottlenecks in accessing the financing have to be fixed.”Speaking from Dubai, Jama, who is attending the climate summit, added that money had to be given as grants, rather than loans, as much of it has been until now, because Somalia cannot afford to take on more debt.Countries such as Somalia, which recently suffered historic floods, have found it difficult to access existing climate funding, he said, which had been geared towards wealthy countries and was not accessible to states recovering from conflict or with fragile political systems.00:01:08Floods hit Somalia after worst drought in four decades – video report“Our goal was to bring to the table the voices of our communities that have been devastated by climate change shocks, from droughts to floods,” he told the Guardian. “We’re hoping the loss and damage funds and other arrangements will help us ameliorate them.”The decision to set up a loss and damage fund was agreed at Cop27 in Egypt in 2022 after years of obstruction by richer countries, which are mostly responsible for emissions. Details of how the fund would operate were not decided.In the deal struck on Thursday, it was agreed the fund would be hosted by the World Bank with an initial pot of $429m (£340m). The estimated loss and damage caused by the climate crisis is estimated in some studies to be $400bn annually.“African countries have contributed to less than 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions … yet when it comes to the impact of climate change, we are forced to live with the dire consequences, in which millions of people lose their livelihoods. As we speak, a third of Somalia is engulfed by floods and people’s livelihoods and their ways of life are being highly disrupted,” said Jama.We need resources to fight health impacts of climate crisis, Africans tell Cop28Read more“Justice has to be the expedition of support [to those countries].”Submerged houses in Beledweyne, Hiran. Recent flooding in Somalia was described the UN as a ‘once-in-a-century event’.

That is where we need massive intervention and we come here to advocate for our nation. And there are other countries in similar situations to ours.”"

This micro-fidget sends a ripple, strikes a tone – there is something weirdly perfect about today. It appears in a rainbow, its feet touching earth beneath black vanilla clouds, with one crock of gold buried under Wat’s Dyke – a ghostly linear earthwork of the northern Welsh Marches – and the other under the orthopaedic hospital in Gobowen. As the sky lifts to a pale autumnal blue, the middle of the arc fades, but the remaining colours are vivid fragments of a lucid dream.Black sheep are lying in the centre of the hillfort because it was and will be raining and they don’t want to be disturbed from their reverie on a spot of warm dry grass. But they are alert now and all staring in the same direction, as if some spectral dog lopes along the fence-line. These are iron age sheep with hard mouths and sharp eyes that shaped the hill country long ago, arranging themselves, black on green – a captive audience from pre-history that is indifferent to human drama. The birds are quiet and distant, even the invisible ones within spitting distance in the hawthorn and oak scrub, their conspiratorial chatter bright as berries, coded into their own frequency.The iron age hillfort, showing the sunken entrance passage cutting through the five ramparts. Photograph: Mick Sharp/AlamyThe far hills are hazy; rains stalk them. Whatever gathers there is beyond this one place, floating free of pervading horrors; even the shadows we cast don’t touch the ground. Then an apparition materialises out of the thin air through which it flies, to alight on a bracken frond. Blacker than a rook, redder than a rosehip, whiter than smoke from the chipboard factory at Chirk – it’s a red admiral butterfly. Perhaps not the last but certainly the most pristine of the many red admirals seen this year, the butterfly adjusts its position on the frond as if aligning to magnetic north.As it does so, the perfect mystery – of a butterfly and unseen birds and black sheep under a rainbow during a moment smoothed into a hedge – is uncannily strange and familiar at the same time. This is ecological beauty. This country diary is dedicated to John Vidal, who died on Thursday 19 October. John was the finest environmental journalist of his time, a great Guardian figure, and a dear friend to us for nearly 50 years; this diary was written from John’s home patch; his magnificent enthusiasm for life is sadly missed."

The ecosystem was protected under “wild rivers” laws in Queensland from 2005 until 2014, when they were scrapped by the Newman government.Labor promised “to legislate protections for Queensland’s pristine rivers from large scale industrial operations” before coming to power in 2015, but little of substance has happened since.The government is preparing a regulatory impact statement, but consultation was delayed during the pandemic. The statement was expected last year but has not yet been released.In the meantime, the state has quietly progressed gas drilling plans by granting oil and gas leases.Fracking in Lake Eyre the ‘height of folly’, report suggestsRead moreOBE Organic, a farmer-owned company that runs cattle herds throughout the Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre basin, released a position statement this week that said the channel country’s rivers and floodplains “must be protected”.“It is OBE Organic’s position that the unique characteristics of the Lake Eyre basin require a unique set of regulation for future oil and gas projects,” the statement said.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n“This regulation may require exclusion of activities to particularly sensitive parts of the Lake Eyre basin river system.“Current regulations which guide the activities of the oil and gas industry are largely self-enforced. Too often there is no consequence for non-compliance. Any new regulation needs to account for the cumulative impact of oil and gas extraction in the Lake Eyre basin.”Following the beef producer’s statement, the Liberal National party opposition called on the government to release the regulatory impact statement.“Releasing these policy options is essential to provide transparency and certainty for all stakeholders,” an LNP spokesperson said in a statement.Riley Rocco, the coordinator of the Western Rivers Alliance, said it was “encouraging” that the LNP had now recognised the urgency of the issue.“We have been waiting eight years for the Palaszczuk government to deliver its promise to protect this globally significant river system,” Rocco said.“While we wait, oil and gas interests are increasingly encroaching on significant wetland and floodplain areas, threatening to divert and pollute the flood waters that sustain the green heart of arid Australia and local livelihoods.”The Queensland environment minister, Meaghan Scanlon, said the regulatory impact statement had to be done “thoroughly and properly” and that government was committed to its release.”We are only having this discussion because the former LNP government … tore up protections,” Scanlon said.“But I welcome their new interest, and look forward to their constructive engagement when the [statement] is released.”Government sources have previously said the issue of regulating the channel country has been the source of tension and disagreement between the state’s environment and resources departments.Queensland quietly grants fracking leases to Origin in fragile channel countryRead moreGuardian Australia reported in 2020 that an independent scientific panel commissioned by the Queensland government had recommended a ban on fracking in the Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre basin, but the experts’ findings were made secret by the state and ultimately ignored.Nick Holliday, the Queensland outreach coordinator for the conservation group Lock the Gate, said the government needed to protect the channel country. He said it was “abundantly clear” that oil and gas production could not coexist with the beef industry in the region.“The floodplains of the channel country rivers of the Lake Eyre basin are amongst Queensland’s most productive beef cattle country,” he said.“The industrialisation of that landscape by gas fracking will have far-reaching consequences for graziers.”"

        "text": "Hunters have shot dead 54 wolves in a month in Sweden’s largest and most controversial cull of the animals yet, prompting fury from conservationists and satisfaction among farmers who consider the predators a threat to their livelihoods.The Stockholm government has authorised the shooting of 75 wolves in its 2023 cull, more than twice last year’s figure, despite warnings from scientists that wolf numbers are not large enough to sustain a healthy population.“Wolves are a threat for those of us who live in rural areas,” said Kjell-Arne Ottosson, a Christian Democrat MP and vice-president of the parliament’s environment and agriculture committee. “We have to manage that. We have to take this seriously.”Farmers say more than 340 sheep were killed in 2021 by a Swedish wolf population estimated at about 460. The predators, which in the 1960s were thought to be extinct in Sweden, are also resented by hunters, who say the dogs they use to track and drive deer and elk are regularly attacked.“This cull is absolutely necessary to slow the growth of wolves. Sweden’s wolf population is the largest we have had in modern times,” Gunnar Glöersen, predator manager at the Swedish Hunters’ Association, told public broadcaster SVT.However, the scale of this year’s planned cull – only 203 wolves have been shot in total in Sweden in the 12 years since authorised hunting resumed – has alarmed conservationists. “It’s tragic,” said Daniel Ekblom of the Nature Conservation Society. “It could have consequences for a long time to come.”Scientists have said the that to sustain a healthy population, the wolf population roaming Sweden and Finland should not fall below 500, and Sweden’s Environmental Protection Agency has said at least 300 are necessary to avoid harmful inbreeding.Led by centre- and far-right parties, however, Sweden’s parliament voted two years ago to cap the wolf population at 270, while the Swedish Hunters’ Association wants to go even further and lower the limit to 150 animals.Wolf numbers fell steeply in Sweden after 1789, when a law was passed allowing commoners to hunt. That led to the decimation of the deer and elk populations, prompting wolves to prey more on livestock – and the state to pay a bounty for every wolf killed.The population shrank to the brink of extinction and the predator was declared a protected species in the 1960s. Numbers began growing again 20 years later, however, when three wolves from the Russian-Finnish population migrated to central Sweden.The European Commission has previously opened infringement proceedings against Sweden, warning that the annual cull falls foul of the EU’s habitats directive since “the wolf population has not reached a level that guarantees its conservation”.“It’s astonishing that Sweden keeps on making these decisions,” said Marie Stegard Lind of the anti-hunting group Jaktkritikerna. “The commission has been very clear about its opinion that these hunts are, in fact, illegal,” Lind told AFP.This year’s cull began in early January and ends on 15 February, although several regional authorities have already called it off having reached their quota. Experts have said the government’s planned national total of 75 wolves may not be reached.Under pressure from farmers and hunters, the government authorised limited annual culls again in 2010. Since then, the wolf “has become a symbol of the conflict between the city and rural areas”, Johanna Sandahl of the Nature Conservation Society told AFP."

        "text": "The flat landscape of the East Anglian Fens is known for its vast arable fields and absence of trees. But just over 4,000 years ago, these lowlands were dominated by dense woods of ancient yew trees.A study of hundreds of tree trunks inadvertently dug up by fenland farmers has found that this woodland abruptly disappeared 4,200 years ago, probably because a rapid rise in the North Sea flooded the low-lying region with saltwater.Remnant trees dug up during deep ploughing and discarded at field edges are popularly known as “bog oaks”. But when scientists from the University of Cambridge sampled the logs, they found more than 400 yew trees, some of which had been 400 years old when they died.The ancient yews, one of the longest-lived species in Europe but today absent from the marshy Fens, were unusually well preserved, enabling the Cambridge team to extract precise information from trunks between 2 and 8 metres long.An ancient yew near Wraysbury in Berkshire, England. Photograph: Steve Taylor ARPS/AlamyTatiana Bebchuk, the lead author of the paper published in Quaternary Science Reviews, said: “A common annoyance for Fenland farmers is getting their equipment caught on big pieces of wood buried in the soil, which can often happen when planting potatoes, since they are planted a little deeper than other crops.“When I first saw this enormous pile of abandoned trees, it was incredible just how many there were. But when we got them back to lab, we were even more surprised: these trees were so well-preserved, it looked as if they were cut down just yesterday.”Annual growth rings within tree trunks contain information about temperature and climate for each growing season. But finding tree rings so far back in time is unusual because wood rots.These trunks, subfossils preserved in the peaty fenland soils, showed up to 400 years of irregular tree rings. Combined dendrochronological (tree-ring) analysis and radiocarbon dating pinpointed the ancient yews to a period from about 5,200 to 4,200 years ago, when a dense native woodland including oak as well as yew covered the Fens.The researchers believe the yews declined as the region became wetter but suddenly disappeared because of an abrupt rise in sea level, which coincides with big climatic changes elsewhere in the world, including a mega-drought in China and the Middle East that could have caused the collapse of several civilisations, including Egypt’s Old Kingdom and the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia.Bebchuk said: “We want to know if there is any link between these climatic events. Are the mega-droughts in Asia and the Middle East possibly related to the rapid sea level rise in northern Europe? Was this a global climate event, or was it a series of unrelated regional changes?“We don’t yet know what could have caused these climate events, but these trees could be an important part of solving this detective story.”"

They said the department had provided some data on shark management to councils as part of its presentations and said it had followed “standard practice” in requesting that this information not be published.“DPI expects all council officers it liaises with to have full and open discussions with their council on information it shares,” the spokesperson said.Randwick is home to some of Sydney’s most popular beaches including Coogee and Maroubra. Last year, British expat Simon Nellist was killed by a great white shark at Little Bay in the council area.Nellist, a 35-year-old diving instructor, had voiced his opposition to shark nets, which are used from September to April at 51 NSW beaches between Newcastle and Wollongong.Environmental groups strongly oppose the nets because animals such as dolphins, seals, turtles and endangered shark species can become trapped in them and die.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Greens MP Cate Faehrmann said her party would consider withholding support for government legislation unless Labor changed its position.Faehrmann wrote to the agriculture minister, Tara Moriarty, earlier this month to ask for a copy of the DPI’s community surveys on shark mitigation.“I would appreciate the department making available the past two years of community sentiment polling that have yet to be published on its website,” she wrote.Faehrmann said it was “unacceptable” the government was “refusing to publish the community attitude survey results”.Animal Justice Party MP Emma Hurst said she had asked for the DPI surveys via a formal parliamentary call for papers, but said the release of the documents was “now being delayed inappropriately”.“We have followed up with the minister, requested meetings and contacted her staff on this issue, and have been completely ignored,” Hurst said.A spokesperson for Moriarty said the survey results would be made public soon.The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said on Wednesday it was a “good ambition” to remove shark nets, but he wasn’t “going to get rushed into” making a decision.“I’ve got to have confidence that the replacement, the new technologies, are as good as, or at least an appropriate substitution for, shark nets in Sydney,” he said.In its response to the 2021-22 annual report on the meshing program, the NSW threatened species scientific committee said the program was not meeting its two objectives.These were to reduce the risk to people from shark bites and to ensure the program did not jeopardise the survival or conservation status of threatened wildlife. The committee supported a change in management strategy."

That’s according to a new study, which found that between 25% and 70% of California beaches might be washed away by the end of the century, leaving only cliffs or coastal infrastructure in their wake.The study used satellite data collected over the past two decades to examine California’s 1,100-mile-long coast. Researchers from the US Geological Survey (USGS) used those satellite images, combined with models of climate crisis-driven sea level rise ranging from 1.6 to 10ft, to estimate the shape and position of the state’s coastline by 2100. The amount of sea level rise will depend on how much carbon is pumped into the atmosphere now and in the future.How solar farms took over the California desert: ‘An oasis has become a dead sea’Read moreThe paper, which is in the process of being peer-reviewed for publication, follows on from a 2017 study conducted by the same researchers focused on the rate of coastal erosion in southern California. That study found a similar fraction of southern California beaches – between 31 and 67% – were susceptible to vanishing.“Beaches are perhaps the most iconic feature of California, and the potential for losing this identity is real,” wrote Sean Vitousek, the researcher who led both the 2017 study and the current one. “Losing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human-management efforts must increase in order to preserve them.”The California Coastal Commission is already encouraging cities to harden their coastline by building seawalls or depositing large rocks that can help protect them from pounding waves (though sea walls can cause sand to erode faster from adjacent beaches). Restoring natural sand dunes can also help protect beaches. The study points to several areas at particular risk of severe erosion: Point Arena and Humboldt Bay in northern California, Pismo Beach and Morro Bay in central California, and Newport Beach and San Clemente in southern California.Losing beaches can have ripple effects on the communities that live inland. A study published in January showed that with 3ft of sea level rise, San Diego county would lose a quarter of picnic areas, half of its lifeguard towers, and 15% of restrooms at coastal access sites. That affects lower-income, historically marginalized populations the most – coastal dwellers tend to be whiter, older and wealthier than the average California resident. Without lifeguards, parking and other amenities, it becomes more difficult for people living far from the coast to enjoy the benefits of remaining beaches.Newport Beach in Orange county was among those deemed particularly at risk of severe coastal erosion. Photograph: Marcio José Sánchez/APThe new study is the first time that satellite-derived shorelines have been used for this type of analysis, says Mark Merrifield, a coastal oceanographer at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, who was not involved in the research. But he warns that the predictions have a wide amount of uncertainty, so they should be taken with some skepticism, he says. “Beach morphology models in general have limited skill in predicting contemporary change, there are few datasets available for validation of the methodology, and projections of future wave and water level conditions introduce another level of uncertainty.”The beaches that have made California famous are already changing, with a 2009 USGS study finding that about 40% of beaches were already experiencing long-term erosion. Looking forward, the shape and size of the beaches is not yet clear, like a wave in the distant view. More research will be needed to bring the future into sharper relief. “It’s a complicated topic,” says Merrifield.Regardless, the study’s authors conclude that “substantial management efforts”, such as dune restoration, will be needed to maintain the beaches as they exist today. “It’s pretty sobering,” Vitousek recently told the San Francisco Chronicle. “This is a slow process when we’re talking about 2100, but it’s not that slow.”"

Plastics have no place in a circular economy and it’s clear that the only real solution to ending plastic pollution is to massively reduce plastic production.”Since the 1950s about 8bn tonnes of plastic has been produced. The Greenpeace report catalogues peer-reviewed research and international studies showing not only that just a tiny proportion (9%) of plastics are ever recycled, but also that those that are end up with higher concentrations of toxic chemicals, multiplying their potential harm to human, animal and environmental health.Recycled plastics, the report says, often contain higher levels of chemicals such as toxic flame retardants, benzene and other carcinogens, environmental pollutants including brominated and chlorinated dioxins, and numerous endocrine disruptors that can cause changes to the body’s natural hormone levels.Waste plastics earmarked for recycling are typically exported from high-income countries to poorer parts of the worldDr Therese Karlsson, a science adviser with the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), said: “Plastics are made with toxic chemicals, and these chemicals don’t simply go away when plastics are recycled. The science clearly shows that plastic recycling is a toxic endeavour with threats to our health and the environment all along the recycling stream.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We should not recycle plastics that contain toxic chemicals. Real solutions to the plastics crisis will require global controls on chemicals in plastics and significant reductions in plastic production.”Plastic production is forecast to triple by 2060. Greenpeace said any global plastics treaty must achieve immediate significant reductions in plastic production, as a first step on a pathway to the total elimination of the manufacture of virgin plastic.Those plastics that remain must be reused as far as possible, while waste disposal technologies are developed that do not involve simply burning it or burying it, Greenpeace said."

It has these umbrella-like structures that mimic the natural structure of goosedown in terms of providing that nice lofty, fluffy feeling.”For farmers on lowland peat in the north-west, it is hoped the trial could provide an alternative source of income while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The chosen site in Greater Manchester was drained for agriculture more than 50 years ago, something that will be reversed next year to plant the bulrushes. This could save 2,800 tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2050 and boost biodiversity, according to the Wildlife Trust.“I’ve been farming this land for 35 years and have seen steadily declining yields and increasing difficulty finding a market for traditional crops,” says Steve Denneny, who will be growing the bulrush crop on land owned by the Peel Group. “I think wetter farming could be the future for a lot of lowland agricultural peat, and it’s great to be part of it right at the start.”Paludiculture has been given around £5m of funding for trials and experimentation, which also include farming sphagnum moss for peat-free compost. In some parts of the country, such as Norfolk, wetland farming on peatlands dates back to ancient times, with the eastern wetlands used to produce reeds for thatch.Farmers cut reeds for thatching on Cley Marshes in north Norfolk, where wetland farming dates back to ancient times.

A control site will also be set up to monitor the business-as-usual scenario.Dank, ancient and quite fantastic: Scotland’s peat bogs breathe againRead more“If we can make this trial successful and upscale it, there is so much lowland peat in the UK that is crying out to be rewetted, both environmentally and economically,” says Mike Longden of the Wildlife Trust.“Farming on lowland peat can be really difficult. It’s not the most profitable farming.” Ideas like the bulrush project, therefore, could mean a lucrative “win-win”, says Longden.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"

        "text": "A former Australian defence force chief has called on the government to release its assessment of the security threats posed by the climate crisis, which he says they received late last year.Guardian Australia understands the Office of National Intelligence’s “urgent climate risk assessment” looked at how global heating affected Australia’s national security, but relied in part on classified information.This means the government would have to decide whether, and how, the assessment is released publicly.Anthony Albanese to order intelligence chief to examine security threats posed by climate crisisRead moreThe former ADF chief Chris Barrie said he was concerned climate security risks were “missing in action” in the public debate triggered by the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine announcement.Barrie said it was “rather surprising” that the Albanese government was continuing the previous Morrison government’s framing of China as the predominant security threat to Australia.“Climate change as a security threat seems to be totally overlooked,” he said.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nBarrie, an executive member of the Australian Security Leaders Climate Group, said he had been told the ONI-led assessment of external climate risks was completed in November or December. Ordering such an assessment had been a Labor election promise.Barrie urged the government to take the community into its confidence by releasing a declassified report on the findings. He said Australians should be armed with this information so they could “come on board and help deal with the problem”.“As time goes on, and it does less to bring people into the confidence of government on this, I think it will erode some of the trust the Albanese government has enjoyed in its early days,” Barrie said.He said the community expected the ADF would be there to help when disasters hit, but “there aren’t a lot of available people in a defence organisation like ours”.Australia may also be asked to respond to crises in Pacific island countries and south-east Asia.“If you could imagine concurrent events, like the black summer of bushfires and a call from another country in our region for help, we’re going to be really stretched in setting priorities and managing those pressures because we simply don’t have enough resources,” Barrie said.The climate risk assessment is separate from the defence strategic review, which was led by the former defence chief Angus Houston and former defence minister Stephen Smith.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re seeing more climate-based disasters, both both in Australia and in our region,” Marles said.A Defence spokesperson said on Tuesday: “As the defence strategic review is with the government for consideration, it would be inappropriate to pre-empt its recommendations or outcomes.”The prime minister’s office was also contacted for comment."

        "text": "The devastating drought in the Horn of Africa would not have happened without the human-made impact of the climate crisis, new science has shown.The drought has affected about 50 million people in the Horn of Africa directly and another 100 million in the wider area. About 20 million people are at risk of acute food insecurity and potentially famine.The region has been suffering its worst drought in 40 years since October 2020, with extended dry conditions punctuated by short intense rainfall that has often led to flash flooding. There have been five consecutive seasons of rainfall below normal levels.At least 4.35 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, and at least 180,000 refugees have fled Somalia and South Sudan for Kenya and Ethiopia, which have also been affected by the drought.According to a study by the World Weather Attribution group of scientists published on Thursday, the ongoing drought would not have happened without human actions that have changed the climate.That is because a lack of rainfall, but also higher temperatures driven by global heating have made the soil and pasture of the region much drier than they would normally be by increasing the evaporation of moisture from the earth and plants.The study found that the recent rainfall conditions would not have led to drought in a world that was 1.2C cooler, and that by a conservative estimate climate change had made droughts such as the current one about 100 more times likely to occur.Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for climate change and the environment at Imperial College London said: “This study shows very strongly that drought is much more than just the lack of rain, and that the impacts of climate change strongly depend on how vulnerable we are. One of the main findings from the recently published Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change synthesis report is that we are way more vulnerable than we thought.”The low rainfall and high temperatures in the Horn of Africa would also have been less severe without the impacts of the climate crisis, the scientists said. But their study also found that climate change was increasing rainfall at certain times of year.In the region covered by the study – southern Ethiopia, southern Somalia and eastern Kenya – rainfall is normally concentrated in two seasons: long rains from March to May, when most of the yearly rainfall occurs, and a further period of short rains, from October to December, with less intense and more variable precipitation.The long rains are now drying up under the influence of the climate crisis, the study found, with low rainfall during this season now twice as likely as before, but the season of short rains is becoming wetter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Five consecutive seasons of below-normal rainfall combined with rain-dependent livelihoods and vulnerability multipliers like conflict and state fragility have created a humanitarian disaster.”The study was conducted by 19 researchers as part of the work of the World Weather Attribution group, which draws together scientists from many countries and regions, including the UK, the US, Europe and Africa, using established models and techniques to determine whether events can be linked to the impacts of the climate crisis."

        "text": "Entering September brings the arrival of meteorological autumn in the northern hemisphere, officially drawing the summer of 2023 to a close.In the UK, the summer was a mixed bag. We started with a fairly pleasant June before entering into a wet and windy July caused by multiple consecutive weekend low pressure synoptic situations. A relatively unusual August followed in which we had two named storms, Antoni and Betty, before a pleasant warm spell.Meanwhile, Japan has been under the influence of a heatwave over the previous few months, leading to the country breaking records for both the hottest month and the hottest summer since records began in 1898.After Japan recorded its hottest mean July temperature, with an average temperature anomaly of +1.91C, the country then went on to break the record for the hottest mean August temperature with a mean temperature anomaly of +2.16C. As a result, August 2023 was the hottest month in Japanese meteorological records. The month was so warm that air temperatures in Tokyo were observed to be peaking above 30C (86F) every day of the month, with the lowest daily maximum being recorded at 31.8C on 9 August.This meant the summer of 2023 was the hottest summer recorded in Japan in the past 125 years. The mean temperature for the season, which is based on observations recorded across 15 locations around the country, reached 1.76C above the seasonal average and beat the previous record from 2010 by 0.68C.Last Friday, Hong Kong raised a rare typhoon signal 10 storm warning in preparation for Typhoon Saola, which arrived that night. Maximum sustained winds of 121mph (195km/h) were recorded from Saola while it was about 20 miles (30km) away from Hong Kong. The typhoon died down in its passing but not without causing about 460 flights to be cancelled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Hundreds of animal species across the globe from ticks to whales have blood contaminated with toxic PFAS, a new analysis of previous peer-reviewed research shows.Alarming levels of PFAS in Norwegian Arctic ice pose new risk to wildlifeRead moreThough the analysis does not aim to reveal how the exposure to PFAS affects wildlife, anecdotal evidence in some of the previous studies show the chemicals are likely sickening animals.The analysis was compiled by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), a nonprofit that tracks PFAS contamination and developed an interactive map that shows which animal species were studied, where they were analyzed, and the levels and types of PFAS found in their bodies.Researchers have found the chemicals in a range of species such as scorpions, pandas, Siberian tigers, turtles, horses, dogs, plankton, sea lions, wild boar, otters and oysters. The breadth of the contamination is “sobering”, said David Andrews, a senior scientist with the EWG.“It has taken six decades of research on humans to really understand how these chemicals impact our biology in so many different ways … and there’s no reason to believe those same impacts are not also occurring in wildlife,” Andrews said.PFAS are a class of about 12,000 chemicals often used to make thousands of consumer products resistant to water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and they are linked to cancer, liver disease, kidney stress, fetal complications and other serious health problems.Federal data shows that nearly all Americans’ blood is contaminated with the compounds, but research on wildlife has been scattered until the EWG analysis aggregated it.The highly mobile chemicals accumulate and continuously cycle through the environment because they do not break down, and they can be carried long distances through the atmosphere. That means even animals in remote parts of the world that are far from industrial sources, such as penguins in Antarctica or polar bears in the Arctic, can be contaminated with high levels of PFAS.US military accused of obstruction over cancer linked to ‘forever chemicals’Read moreResearchers have found about 120 kinds of PFAS compounds in animals’ blood, though that figure is likely higher because limits on testing capabilities make it difficult to identify many of the chemicals.The impact on animals’ health remains unclear, but last year researchers in North Carolina found autoimmune disorders similar to lupus in alligators living in water contaminated by a nearby PFAS plant owned by chemical manufacturer Chemours. Researchers also found evidence of immune system issues in north Pacific sea turtles.“All this research has been done, yet the next step still needs to happen – this should be a call for much greater restriction,” Andrews said. “It’s a clear indication that no more of this contamination should be going out into the environment.” This article was amended on 22 February 2023. Penguins are in Antarctica, not the Arctic as an earlier version said."

There’s a skirmish before some retreat to an ivy-shrouded crypt, while a robin flits between gravestones calling a bugle-esque song, declaring this territory won.St Edmund and St Mary’s church sits in the centre of the rural village of Ingatestone. Tucked down the side of the churchyard is a first world war memorial. The obelisk itself is nothing unusual, but one name, tucked unassumingly into the roll call, sets it apart. Pte Archibald Browne, who lived locally, was 26 when he was tied to a post, blindfolded and shot, at 4.30am on 19 December 1914.Browne was one of 306 men who were executed during the war for the supposed crimes of desertion, cowardice, falling asleep at post and throwing down arms. Browne went missing on duty and was caught. A brigadier recommended execution to make a “serious example” of him. Thousands were convicted of military crimes but given reduced sentences – Browne was unlucky.‘Pte Archibald Browne, who lived locally, was 26 when he was tied to a post, blindfolded and shot, at 4.30am on 19 December 1914.’ Photograph: Alexandra Pearce-BroomheadSome of the 306 suffered from shellshock (post-traumatic stress disorder) and had undergone treatment. Doctors understood the condition, but it wasn’t enough to garner sympathy. Others were young. Herbert Burden was only 17 when he was branded a coward and shot. Executions were carried out during the early hours; at this time of year, the volley of shots would cut through a dawn chorus.Often, men from the prisoner’s own battalion – who had fought alongside him just days before – carried out the punishment. Some were sick, others cried, many claimed to point their gun away, not wanting to deliver the fatal shot, and survivors reported having never reconciled themselves with being part of a firing squad.The 306 were collectively pardoned in 2006, and a few, like Browne, have their names etched alongside those who fell in battle. Most have yet to be given the same honour.In this tranquil springtime scene, blossom falls from the nearby cherry trees on to the path. I spy among it a white feather, and place it on the memorial. One hundred and ten years ago, these men would have found the gesture offensive, an accusation of cowardice. But I mean it as an offering of peace to all those who gave their lives in the first world war. Every single one. Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"

        "text": "Mild El Niño climatic conditions brewing in the Pacific Ocean will strengthen throughout the year, with an outside chance of a record-breaking event that will further turbocharge already sweltering temperatures around the globe, scientists have forecast.Last month saw a “weak” El Niño form, a periodic climatic event where the circulation of the equatorial Pacific Ocean shifts and its temperature rises, causing knock-on heat around the world, according to an update from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).This Niño, which has replaced a three-year period of its reverse condition, La Niña, which typically cools the globe, will almost certainly strengthen throughout the year, with an 81% chance it will peak with a “moderate to strong intensity” between November and January, Noaa said.There is a one-in-five chance that this event will be of “historic” strength, rivaling the major one experienced in 1997, Noaa said. Even if the record is not threatened, however, “El Niños tend to elevate global mean temperatures, so I would not expect this event to be an exception,” said Michelle L’Heureux, a Noaa meteorologist.The developing event has been closely watched by scientists as it is compounding the excess heat spurred by human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels. Last week was, preliminary data suggests, the hottest week ever reliably recorded, following a June that was the hottest ever documented globally.More than 100 million people in the US are currently under heat warnings, with scorching conditions felt across Texas and the south-west in recent weeks. Heatwaves have also roiled China, India, parts of Europe and the Arctic.00:03:14What you need to know about the 'extreme' heatwave hitting our oceans – video explainerThe heat is not confined to the land, with Noaa confirming on Thursday that ocean surface temperatures were at a record high for a third consecutive month in June, with marine heatwaves sweeping the North Atlantic to the UK, as well as imperiling ailing coral reefs found off Florida.The developing Niño is likely to push the world towards even more record-breaking temperatures, scientists warn, as the tangible impacts of the climate crisis continue to unfold.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "I’m not too sure where to begin with Extrapolations, Apple TV+’s star-studded anthology series about the possible impact of the climate crisis on humanity’s future. On the one hand, it is well intentioned and at its best drives home the horror of our impending doom through finely constructed tales and brilliant performances. On the other, there is a death-by-walrus that is not played for laughs, Meryl Streep voicing a humpback whale and the opening episode is an impenetrable heap of chaos.Let’s call it a mixed bag. Creator Scott Z Burns wrote the 2011 Steven Soderbergh hit Contagion, which enjoyed a resurgence during the pandemic as people rewatched it to admire its prescience and, as the months wore on, score it for realism. In Extrapolations there is less to get hold of, even though there is plenty going on.The first, wildly convoluted, episode is set in 2037 as crisis talks about global warming are being held in Tel Aviv while forest fires, droughts, riots and refugees abound across the world. Its main purpose seems to be to impart the project’s heavy sense of its own worthiness (I have rarely looked at my watch so much in an hour to see if time was still passing) and to introduce us to the main characters who will recur throughout the series. Also to introduce us to Matthew Rhys, who plays an amoral profiteer and whose agent I suspect needs a word about reading to the end of a script to see quite what’s in store for his client.Kit Harington plays tech multibillionaire Nick Bilton, who holds the patents for various desalination techniques and therefore the fate of millions in his hands. Sienna Miller is pregnant research scientist Rebecca who will give birth to a baby with “summer heart”, a genetic abnormality caused by pollution. Daveed Diggs is a rabbi who is called to help ordinary people drowning in the horrors of the increasingly unliveable future.Heather Graham, Tahar Rahim, Peter Riegert are also in the mix, with Streep pitching up in the second episode, and the likes of Marion Cotillard, Forest Whitaker, Tobey Maguire, Diane Lane and Edward Norton come thick and fast after that as we move through the increasingly catastrophic years. By episode three, set in 2047, Miami is disappearing underwater. Come the 2060s there is no sun or wind after a geoengineering project is FUBARed. By the final episode, the international court at The Hague is considering the case for ecocide against Bilton.Marion Cotillard in Extrapolations. Photograph: Zach Dilgard/Apple TV+Extrapolations is at its best when it finds the sweet spot between lecturing and enlightening, but these moments don’t come frequently enough. More often it finds itself stuck at the student debate level set in the first episode when a protester who is about to deliver a speech on the failure of the 2015 Paris agreement, via a giant hologram, is asked if there’s anything she needs. “Yes,” she says. “For people to listen!” Elsewhere there is anthropomorphic schmaltz, unlikely reactions and sometimes both at the same time, as when Rebecca sabotages her company’s project when she finds it requires lying … to a whale.Even at its best, it fails to move the viewer in the same way that, say, Russell T Davies’s Years and Years did as it condensed the existential threat of the climate emergency into the particular effects on one ordinary family over the decades. There, the fear was distilled and evoked far more effectively than any effort to show the true scale of what faces us could ever be, however starry the names and heartfelt the attempt. This article was amended on 19 March 2023 to correct a misspelling of Peter Riegert’s surname.Extrapolations is on Apple TV+ now."

        "text": "Dr Tom Smith is a wildfires scientist. His career has focused on tracking down wildland fires in savannahs and tropical peatlands around the globe, but his latest investigation was closer to home.It took place on a weekend in early December. “I noticed the familiar smell of wood smoke inside my flat,” Smith said. “I’m well aware of its harmful health effects from my research, so I went outside with my portable pollution sensor in search of the source.”Air pollution in the street was even worse than indoors. “As soon as I got outside, the readings on my sensor jumped. A short walk upwind confirmed my suspicions: the pub opposite my estate had smoke billowing from its chimney.“Concentrations in front of the houses near the pub were even higher than outside my flat. Exposure like this over long periods of time will aggravate the heart and lungs of anyone in the smoke plume. Children, asthmatics and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable.”Smith’s experience is not an isolated example. Last winter, researchers from Imperial College London surveyed wood and coal smoke in gardens and streets. There is further evidence from citizen scientists, including a group of friends who track the smoke that drifts across the gardens and into houses in Chorley, Lancashire.Last month I visited one of the UK’s most advanced air pollution measurement sites, located in the south of Manchester, where researchers from the University of Manchester make detailed measurements of the gases and particles in the air. The roof is a forest of sample pipes sucking air into the instruments below. A laser scans the sky to search for pollution above and another set of lasers create a light curtain to measure rain and fog.Dr James Allan sat down at a computer screen and looked at data streams from the past 24 hours. It was clear that the particle pollution in the city had changed around sunset. During the day there were clear signs of traffic emissions, but in the evening the air contained smoke from home fires.Allan said: “At night in the winter we see high concentrations of particle pollution. The particles are smaller than 1 micron [a thousandth of a millimetre]. There is a lot of organic particles and black carbon, which we’d associate with soot.”He explained how his instruments detected wood burning using light of different wavelengths. “Soot from wood burning absorbs more ultraviolet light compared with fossil fuel emissions, and when we compare the daytime to nighttime readings we see this signature. It indicates wood burning is having a stronger influence at night.”Regular exposure has a health impact. A recent study estimated that 284 Londoners a year are dying earlydue to outdoor air pollution from solid fuel heating. It also estimated that about 90 new cases of asthma in children, 60 new cases of stroke and 30 new lung cancer cases a year were linked to this pollution. This is a health burden of almost £800 a year created by the average person in London who uses a fireplace or stove.Research commissioned by the charities Global Action Plan and Impact on Urban Health used a computer simulation of two mid-terrace houses to investigate the costs of different heating choices. The houses had simulated occupants. One housed a family with two children and the other a retired couple.The neighbourhood health cost from heating the homes with fossil gas central heating was about £25 a year. Adding a wood stove for 20% of their heating took the cost to about £160 for one of the most modern stoves, or more than £1,000 for an older stove design. This does not include health harm to the stove owners.Dr Gesche Huebner, of University College London, one of the researchers on the study, said: “Wood burning is not a solution for reaching net zero or avoiding high bills for individuals. It is not cheaper, not truly renewable, but it constitutes a major health risk.”"

We have lifeguards on WaveRunners that watch over the waters,” he added, referring to a commercial brand of personal watercraft that is a rival to the Kawasaki-manufactured Jet Ski.The first shark bite incident in the latest flurry happened on Monday, when a 15-year-old girl was reportedly bitten on the leg by a shark while swimming at Long Island’s Robert Moses beach. Another youngster, 15, was bitten on the foot while surfing off the adjacent Fire Island, CNN reported.On Tuesday, a 49-year-old man was bitten on the hand while swimming in Fire Island, News 12 reported.In a separate incident, a 47-year-old man was reportedly bitten on the knee at Quogue Village beach, a public beach further east on Long Island, towards the Hamptons. Although a shark was not seen, officials said that the bite mark likely came from a large marine animal.Officials say shark bites have become increasingly common in the past few years. Last year, eight people reported being bitten by sharks near Long Island’s beaches.“This year, we’ve already had five bites,” said Gorman, and “the season has kind of just begun.”But one shark expert said officials must keep the figures in perspective.Greg Metzger, chief field coordinator with the Sofo Shark Research Program in Bridgehampton, New York, told the Guardian that the increase in shark bites this year is “completely random” and that shark bite figures remain small.“Out of the hundreds of thousands of opportunities [for shark interaction], only five went bad. So the chances of being in a negative situation with a shark is extremely, extremely small,” said Metzger.“It’s really just chance and bad luck for those individuals who have had those interactions,” he added.Metzger also said the surveillance techniques being rolled out may not be ideal for spotting sharks, encouraging instead more education about sharks for beachgoers as a way to increase safety.Sharks are rarely at the shallow depths that allow them to be spotted by surveillance, according to research conducted by the Sofo program.“Ninety percent of the time that a shark could be there, it would not be at the surface where you could see it. It is not necessarily as effective as people might think,” Metzger said, adding that the ocean waters around Long Island are not very clear most of the time.Metzger added that it is very difficult to identify sharks via methods like drones, even for experts like himself.Recent reports that 50 sand sharks were spotted off the coast of a Long Island beach were “absolutely, definitely not sharks”,Metzgersaid.“I caution that perception is reality. If everyone is on ultra-high alert that we’re looking for sharks, you’re going to see sharks. They may not be sharks,” he said, adding that people sometimes mistake dolphin fins, bird wings and even beer bottles for sharks.As more lifeguards are being trained to spot sharks, Metzger cautioned that those without shark experience should consult with experts before closing beaches and taking other measures.Metzger said public officials should take similar precautions before rolling out new initiatives.“It’s unfortunate that officials don’t consult more with shark experts before making these decisions.” This article was amended on 10 July 2023.

        "text": "Stella McCartney opened her winter show not with pyrotechnics or a light display but seven dappled grey horses galloping around the sandy equestrian centre of France’s oldest riding school, L’École Militaire.It was the first time the British designer had shown living animals on the catwalk, but that was the point. “There is so much leather, fur and feathers on these runways, particularly in winter. I just wanted to show that you could show animals in a different way,” she said.There was some front row chatter about the display, choreographed by the horse whisperer Jean-François Pignon. Some found it distracting, others worse. McCartney was at pains to reassure the audience that the horses were “trained by him in a cruelty-free way” and “accustomed to being around large groups of humans”, the brand said in a statement. Backstage, McCartney added: “The difference is that these animals are alive and my clothes haven’t killed anything.”A horse motif and leather-alternative boots. Photograph: Stéphane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty ImagesThe most striking examples of this were the outerwear and the bags. The coats and jackets were long with pointy shoulders and cropped with nipped-in waists, and came in red, black and white versions of quilted vegan leather alternative and responsibly sourced yarn. The “leather” bags and boots were made from grapes, apples and mushrooms.In the label’s 22 years, McCartney has never used leather, feathers, fur or skins, making her a fashion outlier. Although almost every label has now banned fur, and while it is rare to see a show that doesn’t nod in some ways towards “sustainability”, leather has featured in almost every Paris show. McCartney’s aim has always been to prove that you can make “beautifully designed clothes” using alternative materials, the idea being that you shouldn’t be able to tell the difference between the two.Striking full-length coats were a highlight of the collection. Photograph: Marc Piasecki/WireImageIf the vocabulary can feel overwhelming at times – “forest-friendly viscose satin” is a bit of a head-scratcher – she’s keen to point out that while “it doesn’t seem that exciting, in science it’s a big deal”, she said. “Every time you eat an apple, you’re basically eating a handbag.” For the first time, she said, the label has also been able to dye the mushroom leather, meaning the difference between real and fake is imperceptible.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Fashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s about selling clothes. Being who she is – a McCartney, and former It girl – she’s savvy enough to know that her childhood and past can feed into her work.Her most famous collection when she worked at Chloé featured horse prints in 2001. A keen rider, she made knitwear based on horse blankets and transplanted a photograph of a rearing horse by her sister Mary and another by her late mother, Linda, on to flapping regenerative cotton shirts and lace-detailed slip dresses. Q Lazzarus’s Goodbye Horses also played through the equestrian public address system.Coats and jackets were long with pointy shoulders and cropped with nipped-in waists.

From the shrunken boho waistcoats to the banana-shaped trousers and ultra-slim “hipsters” with built-in body chains, Y2K fashion really isn’t going anywhere.McCartney’s commitments have put her in a curious position as an environmentalist and activist within the luxury fashion industry. She insists: “LVMH [the conglomerate that part owns Stella McCartney] have been open to the whole concept – I mean, they’re letting me sit here and talk about the relationship between killing animals and making fashion.”Yet the question over making animal-free clothes affordable to a mass market remains one of fashion’s sticking points. “At least we’re all in this together,” she said.Vegan bag and boots: McCartney has never used leather, feathers, fur or skins.

        "text": "Raw sewage has been discharged into Chichester harbour for more than 1,200 hours in the past month, in what campaigners described as “an assault on the environment”.The protected harbour in West Sussex, which is a designated area of outstanding natural beauty (AONB), has been subjected to the discharges since 24 October.Data from Southern Water’s Beachbuoy system, which shows real-time sewage discharges from storm overflows, reveals the storm outflow at Thornham in Chichester has been releasing sewage for 710 hours and five minutes between 24 October and 23 November.The storm overflow at Bosham, also in the harbour, shows a number of discharges including one of 281 hours and 24 minutes between 27 October and 8 November, and another of 213 hours and 7 minutes.Ed Acteson of SOS Whitstable, which campaigns for an end to raw sewage dumping in Kent, Sussex and Hampshire, said: “That a coastal bathing location such as Chichester harbour, a designated area of outstanding natural beauty, should suffer over 1,200 hours of sewage pollution in a under month is nothing short of an assault on the environment.”The wildlife site is one of 34 in England protected by law to conserve and enhance its natural beauty.Southern Water has labelled the raw sewage discharges as “genuine” on its Beachbuoy app, suggesting it believes they are compliant with permits issued by the Environment Agency. The company is blaming heavy rainfall caused by Storm Babet and Storm Ciarán for the discharges.Matt Briers, the chief executive of Chichester Harbour Conservancy, said: “Water quality sampling in the harbour has confirmed increased levels of pollution following recent heavy rainfall.“This highlights the inability of local infrastructure to cope and the critical importance for urgent improvements to infrastructure essential in preventing pollution entering the harbour from storm overflow and runoff.”Briers said the conservancy group would continue to push for tighter control of pollution in the sea that was fit for a protected natural landscape.He said the group was “extremely concerned” about the impact of pollution in the harbour resulting from human activity. This can range from sewage entering the harbour water but also microplastics, chemicals and nitrates.“The harbour AONB is one of the most important sites for wildlife in the UK. Already threatened, its protected habitats were assessed to be in an ‘unfavourable declining’ condition in 2021,” he said. “Good water quality is essential for the health of the harbour; particularly for the wildlife that depend on it.”Chichester harbour is one of three harbours where Southern Water is spending £72m on treating more wastewater and reducing storm overflows to help the natural habitats.SOS Whitstable also highlighted that during a similar time period, two outfalls in Sandown, Isle of Wight, had more than 1,380 hours combined spillage time.Storm Babet hit the UK on 18-20 October, with the Met Office recording the three-day period as the third wettest for England and Wales since 1891.Storm Ciarán followed from 1-2 November, causing a major incident in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight as it worsened existing flooding problems.“The astonishing length of the sewage releases … will have a devastating environmental effect on these areas and, despite the heavy rainfall in recent weeks, there can be absolutely no justification over this level of water pollution,” said Acteson.“Storm overflows are supposed to be used in exceptional circumstances to ease pressure on the sewage network. How could anybody seriously claim that a month of consecutive sewage pollution is ‘exceptional’?”A spokesperson for Southern Water said: “We agree with campaigners and our customers that storm overflow releases are not acceptable and that’s why reducing this is our top priority.”Explaining the cause of these specific incidents, the spokesperson added: “These longer releases are as a result of weeks of heavy rainfall, where either surface water is running off already saturated ground into our sewers, or groundwater is forcing its way into our pipes as pressure builds.”"

        "text": "An increasing number of research studies are showing that low emission zones (LEZs) improve health.More than 320 zones are operating across the UK, Europe and notably in Tokyo, Japan. These reduce air pollution across an area by curbing the number of highly polluting vehicles, normally older diesels. Schemes, including London’s ultra-low emission zone, can improve air quality. This should lead to improved health, but does this actually happen?A new review, published in the Lancet Public Health journal, has gathered research on schemes in cities around the world. Rosemary Chamberlain, from Imperial College London, who was part of the review team, said: “We wanted to bring together the most up-to-date studies from LEZs globally, to understand their effectiveness and to inform future plans to address air pollution.”LEZs are not the same everywhere, making them hard to compare. Some apply to lorries and buses only, while others also include taxis, cars and motorcycles. The health researchers in each country also used different approaches and different data sources. The studies compared data before and after the LEZ start date and some also made comparisons with areas with no LEZ. Data came from health survey results, GP and hospital records, and death registrations.Despite these differences in approach, five of the eight LEZ studies showed a clear reduction in heart and circulatory problems when an LEZ was implemented. These included fewer admissions to hospital, fewer deaths from heart attacks and strokes, and fewer people with blood pressure problems. These results came from zones in Germany, Japan and the UK. One of the German studies analysed hospital data from 69 cities with LEZs. It found a 2%-3% reduction in heart problems and 7%-12% reduction in stroke. The improvements were greatest for older people and resulted in estimated health cost savings of €4.4bn (£3.8bn).Not all studies found the same results. Five studies, again covering zones in Germany, Japan and the UK, looked at breathing and lung problems. Two found improvements and the remainder showed no definite result. None showed a clear deterioration.Chamberlain explained: “This review shows that LEZs are able to improve health outcomes linked to air pollution, with the evidence being most consistent for cardiovascular disease, such as heart disease and strokes. It is, however, too soon to fully judge the long-term benefits.”The latest evidence on the effects of air pollution tells us that the health damage from air pollution accumulates over our lifetimes. Cancer from air pollution is the most obvious example, but it also hampers children’s physical and cognitive development and adds to chronic diseases in later life, including osteoporosis and dementia. The LEZ studies were not long enough to show these types of lifetime effect, although two studies on German zones showed that health benefits tended to grow over three- and five-year periods. One study, of the Tokyo zone, detected improvements in lung cancer rates six to nine years later.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Orangutans on the island of Borneo continue to be illegally killed, likely in large numbers, even when there are nearby projects to save the critically endangered primate, according to new research.Despite the taboo and illegal nature of killing orangutans, researchers heard evidence of a direct killing from at least one person in 30% of 79 villages surveyed in Indonesia’s Kalimantan region.The research – which involved interviews with more than 400 villagers – comes more than a decade after a study claimed between 2,000 and 3,000 orangutans were likely being directly killed every year.Making tracks: how linking patches of wilderness is saving Borneo’s wildlifeRead moreStudies have estimated there are less than 100,000 Bornean orangutans left in the wild. Females produce only one offspring every six to eight years.The island of Borneo is divided between Malaysia, the state of Brunei and Indonesia, which controls three-quarters of the island.Staff from a community development organisation carried out the interviews in 2020 and 2021 and asked villagers questions about orangutan killing, such as “When was the last time someone in your village killed an orangutan?”Researcher Emily Massingham of the University of Queensland, who led the study, said the reasons for direct killing were varied and “socially complex”.She said: “We found that killing does seem to still be happening and a lot of it had happened in the previous five years. I was shocked to see 30% of villages had evidence of killing in the last five to 10 years.”Experts said orangutans are killed for several reasons. People may kill out of fear or because the animals are invading gardens or crops.Mothers may also be killed so that babies can be caught and sold for the pet trade or to be trained as performers. Orangutans are sometimes killed if they enter plantations, and also for their meat and body parts.Habitat clearing, including to produce palm oil, has also pushed orangutans closer to human settlements.The study, published in the journal Conservation Science and Practice, also found a village’s proximity to a conservation project had no effect on the likelihood of killings being reported.“We were interested to know if having a project nearby might make killing less likely, or if it had an impact on people’s attitudes,” Massingham said.“Any killing of orangutans is likely to have a huge impact on their populations because they’re slow-breeding and long-lived animals.”To gauge social norms, villagers were also asked to comment on what actions they thought others would take in hypothetical scenarios.Massingham said the only legally sound reply to the scenarios would be to leave the animal alone, but only 40% of people interviewed gave that response.One study last year found US$1bn had been invested to try to protect orangutans between 2000 and 2019 on Borneo and the Indonesian island of Sarawak – the species’ only homes.Orangutans use slang to ‘show off their coolness’, study suggestsRead moreMassingham and her colleagues suggest conservation projects should work with communities to design approaches to tackle the problem of direct killing, which could be being ignored or downplayed.“There’s a lot of funding going into helping orangutans but maybe not enough going in to communities,” she said. “A lot of these villages are subsistence based, so there is a tension there.”Dr Anne Russon, an orangutan expert at York University in Toronto, said the research findings were “disturbing and sad, but absolutely credible” and it was clear that direct killing remained a substantial threat.Prof Andrew Marshall of the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the new research, has been studying orangutans in Borneo for 27 years. He said he was “saddened, but not surprised” by the research findings.“Studying hunting of legally protected, endangered species is difficult. Folks are often reticent to report killings, fearing that they will either be reported to authorities or viewed negatively by outsiders. For these reasons, the results of the paper are almost certainly underestimates of the true magnitude of the threat hunting poses to orangutans,” he said.There was little evidence, he said, of an improvement in fortunes for the species and “without new and effective conservation interventions face extinction within our lifetimes”. This article was amended on 10 October 2023. An earlier version said that orangutans only lived on Borneo and “the Indonesian island of Sarawak”. This should have said Sumatra; Sarawak is a Malaysian state."

People in this country care very much about animal welfare and that should be reflected in actions taken by government. There is an expectation that government will see these reforms through, and of course we should.”Zac Goldsmith has described the production of foie gras as an ‘abomination’. Photograph: Tayfun Salcı/Zuma/Rex/ShutterstockIn 2021, the government hailed its action plan, and claimed that leaving the EU meant it could take steps to stop cruelty abroad. Fur and foie gras production are banned on cruelty grounds in the UK but products can still be imported. Foie gras is produced when geese and ducks are prevented from exercising and force-fed so that their livers grow abnormally fat.Goldsmith recently likened the production of the delicacy to assaulting a household pet, tweeting: “It should be banned everywhere. You (rightly) can’t kick a cat, but producing foie gras takes cruelty to a whole new level. It is an abomination.”Other measures included in the animal welfare plan, which have not yet been taken through parliament, include a ban on the advertisement of elephant-riding holidays abroad and a ban on the import of hunting trophies.Campaigners accused ministers of pandering to a minority. Claire Bass, the senior director of public affairs and campaigns at Humane Society International/UK, said: “A tiny minority of Conservative ministers and backbenchers appear to have a temporary stranglehold on the government’s ambitions to tackle cruel and unnecessary imports like fur.“But this is a viewpoint that is putting the government out of step with public opinion and expectations, across all geographies and social demographics of Britain. The environment secretary and all MPs should be assured that voters’ disgust for the cruelty of the fur trade is consistent.”A government spokesperson said: “Fur farming has been banned in the UK for over 20 years, and the production of foie gras by force-feeding is already illegal in the UK. The UK has some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world and, as set out in our action plan for animal welfare, we are committed to building a clear evidence base to inform future decisions on these issues. We are gathering information and speaking to a range of interested parties to help us do this.”"

        "text": "It has been the target of an “if you see it, stomp it” campaign in the eastern US for several years. But now the spotted lanternfly – an elegant but invasive insect with distinctive red wings – might be on the decline in some areas.On the hunt with New York’s spotted lanternfly squishers: ‘I came to kill’Read moreHarmless to humans, spotted lanternflies can damage trees and fruit crops, and feed on the sap of over 70 different species of host plants. They are now common across the north-east. In New York, red splats, from eager lanternfly stompers, are a frequent sight on sidewalks.The population is seemingly down in some of the areas where they’ve been established the longest, like south-eastern Pennsylvania. They were first reported there in 2014.“We think this is the result of exhausting the food supply,” said Kelli Hoover, professor of entomology at Pennsylvania State University. The lanternfly’s food of choice is tree of heaven, a plant that is also invasive.It has a higher concentration of sugars in its roots compared with trees like red maples, river birches and willows, making it attractive to the insect. “It’s where they get all their energy,” Hoover said. The state is currently on a mission to eradicate the tree.While lanternfly sightings and surveys in Pennsylvania tallied roughly 9,000 insects in 2017, soaring to 150,000 in 2019, there has been a drastic drop in recent years. Some 61,000 were found in 2021, the latest year for which state data is available.Scientists are split on the significance of these findings.Spotted lanternfly egg mass seen in Pennsylvania. Photograph: Stephen Ausmus/USDAPerhaps there is truly a decline, or perhaps the lower numbers simply mean that “folks are tired of letting us know about it”, said Jay Losiewicz, deputy communications director of the Pennsylvania department of agriculture.“There is really no consensus,” says Julie Urban, professor of entomology at Pennsylvania State University. “There’s evidence that in some areas where it was heavy originally and close to the site of the original introduction, it seems that population there is lower.”But, she added, “they really move around a lot”. And “as their host plants get depleted, they literally move on to greener pastures”.Efforts to eliminate host trees in Pennsylvania could be prompting the pest’s spread to other areas where it can find that food supply.“Without the tree of heaven, the spotted lanternflies are potentially moving further, and dispersing to new areas looking for resources that are out there,” said Matthew Travis, the spotted lanternfly national policy manager for the US Department of Agriculture.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Although not the most adept of flying insects, the spotted lanternfly is an excellent hitchhiker and can find its way into machines that humans travel in, like trains, cars, trucks and planes.Scientists in New Jersey have also noticed lower numbers in 2023.Experts agree that just because the places that used to be thronged with spotted lanternflies are seemingly having an off-year, it doesn’t mean that they’ve left for good. As plants recover, so could lanternfly populations.States are also using insecticides in targeted areas to attempt to control the bug. Stomping is still worthwhile, experts said, not least because it can prevent females from reproducing.“It’s good to do that because every single one of them can lay 30 to 60 eggs,” said Cecilia Sequeira, a spokesperson for the US Department of Agriculture. “And every time you stomp one out that’s one more that isn’t reproducing. Every little bit helps; it is a very prolific pest and we’re probably their biggest natural enemies. It’s pretty important that people do their part.”Female spotted lanternflies typically start to lay their eggs in late August through November, or until the first frost. While the adults freeze to death in the winter, their egg masses can survive. Spotted lanternflies can lay their eggs on a variety of surfaces, including tree trunks, telephone poles, rocks and the undercarriage of vehicles. They resemble a smudge of clay.“That’s 50 insects that could be wiped out simply by taking a credit card out of your wallet, scraping that egg mass off and squashing it,” said Travis."

The same restriction has been placed on other Insulate Britain defendants in previous trials for public nuisance relating to peaceful protests taken as part of the group’s campaign for better insulation in UK homes.Redfern, 58, Reding, 50 and Rennie-Nash, 71, were found guilty of public nuisance by the jury on Monday. The three had been part of a demonstration at Bishopsgate in the City of London on 25 October 2021 in which they sat down and blockaded traffic.David Matthew, prosecuting, told the jury the demonstrators were removed after two hours. The whole area was reopened an hour later after experts cleared solvents from the streets which had been used to remove the superglue with which some demonstrators glued themselves to the road.Matthew said: “There are about 255 buses an hour running through Bishopsgate. Over a protest lasting for two hours there would have been several thousand people whose bus journey was affected.”The blockade was part of Insulate Britain’s campaign to demand a national programme to insulate all homes by 2030.Judge Reid imposed restrictions on what the trio were able to say in their defence. They were prevented from talking about what had motivated them to take action, including a ban on talking about the climate crisis, insulation or fuel poverty. They were also prevented from talking about the civil rights movement in the US.Defendants in six criminal trials for Insulate Britain action have all been restricted from talking about the climate emergency, as a result of rulings by Reid. He told the jury on Monday: “Each defendant acted in the way they did because they felt it was necessary to do so to further their protests. I did not allow you to hear about their motivation because it wasn’t relevant.”One Insulate Britain activist who ignored the judge’s restriction and explained his motivation to the jury in a previous trial has been jailed for eight weeks for contempt of court.David Nixon, a care worker from Barnsley, told the jury: “You’ve not been able to hear these truths because this court has not allowed me to say them. Our safety is at risk, our society is at risk.”He said later at his contempt hearing he found the inability to tell the jury why he had taken part in the protest “soul-destroying”.“If London continues to flood, [if there are more] wildfires, 40C heat, these are decisions that you are having to live with and I – this is going to sound completely unapologetic – I have seen what’s happened in the past week. It underlines climate delay and climate action delay. If we were able to say why we did what we did to the jury they would maybe acquit us,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She later apologised to the judge and was not pursued for contempt of court.Mark Coleman, a retired vicar from Rochdale, was prevented from mentioning the US civil rights movement in any of his evidence at the trial. Aylett, Coleman and two others were convicted by at their trial of causing a public nuisance by taking part in the 25 October roadblock.Reding, Rennie-Nash and Redfern were warned they face a custodial sentence after the guilty verdict on Monday.They are due to be sentenced on 24 March along with the other Insulate Britain activists found guilty at earlier trials, including Nixon, Aylett and Coleman. Another activist, Alex Rodger, 33, who pleaded guilty last week, will also be sentenced."

Sand from the island originates as far as central New South Wales, travelling 1,500km north along the east coast of Australia.“The longshore drift process picks up sand grains and transports them to K’gari and along the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast,” Moss said. “That’s a really important aspect of creating south-east Queensland environment.”K’gari and the dune fields acted as a barrier to this longshore drift process, enabling reef growth, the study’s authors suggest.The researchers dated the age of the dunes on K’gari using two techniques: optically stimulated luminescence and palaeomagnetic dating.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even if they did find the spot, they would almost certainly be disappointed as vanishingly few mussels actually produce pearls.Adult pearl mussels grow up to 14cm long and like clean, fast-flowing water. Photograph: Natural Resources Wales“They are fabulous things,” said Tristan Hatton-Ellis, a freshwater ecologist with NRW. “We are hoping that putting back the riverbed will be massive not just for the pearl mussels but for salmon, trout and invertebrates.”Only about 1,000 ageing adults survive in the wild in Wales. The adults, which are up to 14cm long, like clean, fast-flowing water. They produce glochidia (the larval stage), which attach to the gills of salmon or trout. Then as juveniles they spend up to 10 years buried in river gravels, but none have reached maturity in recent years.Their complicated life cycle means they need rivers with a diverse flow of water, but human activity such as dredging, building embankments and draining the nearby land has degraded the features that pearl mussels thrive in.Over a period of six months, more than 850 tonnes of boulders and cobbles were carefully placed back into the river in Gwynedd along with more than 330 tonnes of fresh gravel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It is one of two specialist freshwater pearl mussel hatcheries in the UK, the other being in Cumbria, in north-west England.Katie Fincken-Roberts, a biodiversity specialist from NRW, said there were currently about 32,000 juveniles in the hatchery. She said: “We need them to grow to a certain size, about 25mm, before we think they’d be robust enough to be released. We have a couple of hundred that would potentially go back this year and then the following year there would be pushing a thousand and hopefully it will ramp up.”"

        "text": "At Conservative party conference this year, green politics is under attack.From the energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, attacking so-called “net zero zealots” to Sunak’s watering down of environmental policies, and the resurgence of the likes of David Frost, Nigel Farage and Jacob-Rees Mogg, it is not in vogue to be green.In previous years, Tory MPs lined up to proclaim their green credentials – it was seen as a vote-winner and a way to show they were caring. Now, not so much.This means many eco-friendly MPs – and there are a few – have simply stayed at home, and those who are here seem to be feeling depressed. After Coutinho attacked those who “view net zero as a religion” she turned up to a Conservative Environment Network (CEN) event to remind them she is a member. The reception was muted, and those present were jokingly referring to themselves as “net zero zealots”.UK net zero policies: what has Rishi Sunak scrapped?Read moreThe former Cop26 president Alok Sharma came to Manchester to make the case for net zero to a group of businesses and Labour’s Andy Burnham at a green summit, but has been conspicuously absent so far from the conference hall. It’s just as well – he has been critical of recent moves to water down environmental protections.Sam Hall, the leader of CEN, who has arguably done more than almost anyone else to keep the Tories united on net zero, put on a brave face, telling the Guardian “much of the actual policies haven’t changed, just the rhetoric around net zero”, but even he described the rhetoric as “unhelpful”. Hall added: “We need a positive case for net zero to combat Labour’s environmental narrative at the election”. So far, Coutinho has stuck to implying the Labour party wants to implement a meat tax.The former Boris Johnson environment adviser Sam Richards now runs Britain Remade, campaigning for more renewable energy. He pointed out that some polling showed Tories getting just 1% of the young vote, suggesting this change in policy and rhetoric may be short-lived if the party wants to court younger voters, for whom the climate crisis is a top priority.The ever industrious former net zero tsar Chris Skidmore told the Guardian he is “doing as much as possible” to keep net zero alive.He warned a fringe event: “It has caused concern – is the UK willing to demonstrate future leadership rather than roll back [on net zero]? It’s undeniable that investors who are making decisions right at this moment in boardrooms around the country about where to place their investments are all looking for that long-term certainty.”Skidmore also addressed Sunak’s claims that net zero is costing “ordinary people”, adding: “Net zero is not a cost, and actually delaying any measures will only cost householders more in additional gas bills, because this has been a cost of gas crisis. Going further and faster on net zero will result in significant savings being made, and that’s where we can deliver to continue to lead in this global net zero race.”Theresa May, the former prime minister who enshrined the net zero target in law, has hoped the green policy, rather than disastrous Brexit votes, would be her legacy.But even she was lukewarm at a CEN drinks reception. She said: “Now, net zero isn’t about a bossy state telling people what to do. We shouldn’t be out there wagging our fingers and saying: ‘You must never fly again.' You can never drive a car again. You can never eat meat again.’ We do that, we won’t take people with us. And as the prime minister has said, we must take people with us.”But May did say that net zero targets must still be met, and that “climate change is the greatest threat to civilisation as we know it”.Smiling thinly, she added: “Remember, we are the only party with ‘conserve’ in our name.”Though much of the Conservative green legacy has been dismantled, that, at least, remains true."

        "text": "Wealthy nations should divert 5% of their military budgets to climate finance, advocates argue.The call comes as global leaders at Cop28 in Dubai gather for a special-themed day on “relief, recovery, and peace” on Sunday, marking the first time climate-fueled conflict has ever been on an international climate conference agenda.Participants will discuss the need to direct aid to “highly vulnerable, fragile, and conflict-affected communities” as evidence mounts that climate disasters put regions at greater risk of war, and amid ongoing conflict in Palestine as well as Ukraine, Sudan, and other areas.But truly protecting communities from climate and conflict will require a shift in priorities, says the Transnational Institute, an international research and advocacy group.“Money is being spent on militarization rather than on climate action,” said Nick Buxton, a researcher with the Transnational Institute, “though the climate crisis is the biggest [common] security threat that we face today.”By diverting just 5% of global military budgets, the world could raise $110.4bn for climate finance – more than enough to meet a repeatedly broken annual climate finance target of $100bn, the organization has found.“National – and global – security in the 21st century will depend on limiting the rise in temperature and resulting havoc more than on any other thing,” said the environmental activist and author Bill McKibben.The world’s militaries produce at least 5.5% of greenhouse gas emissions – more than the total footprint of Japan – according to one 2022 estimate. But no country is required to provide data on military emissions thanks to successful lobbying by the US at the Kyoto conference in 1997. Leaders removed the exemption in 2015 but made reporting military emissions optional.Military spending has grown by more than a quarter in the past decade, exceeding $2.2tn in 2022. During the same time period, attempts to mobilize funds for climate finance have faltered.In 2009, for instance, rich countries agreed to spend $100bn on climate finance for developing world annually by 2020, but they broke that promise, providing only $90bn for climate finance in 2021.Preliminary data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released this month indicates that the $100bn goal may have finally been met in 2022, but some experts say that assessment is based on inflated numbers. A 2022 investigation from Oxfam concluded that due to wealthy nations’ “dishonest and misleading” accounting, climate finance estimates in 2020 were as much as 225% too high.Even if it turns out wealthy nations genuinely met the commitment, said Buxton, countries should still reallocate 5% of their military budgets. The $100bn number is widely understood to be far below the true need in poor countries; one 2022 report found that developing nations need $1tn per year to cope with the climate crisis.Highly polluting nations will also need to come up with funding for loss and damage in poor countries. The need is already greater than $400bn annually and rising, by one estimate.Countries with the largest militaries – largely the richest, most polluting nations – should bear the most responsibility for cutting global defense spending, the researchers say. They place particular focus on Nato, whose 31 members include the UK, Canada and the US, whose military, which is the world’s top-funded, is also the world’s largest institutional emitter.Nato members accounted for more than half of all global military spending last year, and budgets are expected to rise. This year, members made “an enduring commitment to invest at least 2%” of their national budgets to their militaries. If that promise is fulfilled, by 2028, the additional funding would be enough to pay for all needed climate adaptation in hard-hit countries for seven years, the researchers calculated based on United Nations data.Increased militarization harms climate-affected countries in other ways, too, the researchers say. For instance, they found that Nato members are currently selling arms to 39 of the 40 most climate-vulnerable countries; 17 of which are already in armed conflict.“It’s a real perversion: rather than providing support for communities we are actually making the situation more dangerous and more unstable,” said Buxton.Diverting some military spending to climate finance would make the world safer, said Perry O’Brien, climate justice organizer at US veteran-led advocacy group Common Defense.“We know true national security means protecting people and communities from harm,” he said."

        "text": "Australia’s main electricity grid will probably avoid major supply shortages next summer but risks escalate in later years as ageing coal plants exit potentially faster than new renewables and storage projects come on line.The projections are contained in the Australian Energy Market Operator’s updated Electricity Statement of Opportunities report, released on Tuesday.The revision was triggered by several changes in project timings including delays of at least a year for Snowy Hydro’s giant pumped hydro project, Snowy 2.0, and its gas/hydrogen plant at Kurri Kurri in NSW.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nNew gas, wind and battery projects forestalled previously predicted supply gaps in South Australia in 2023-24 and Victoria in the following year. But so-called reliability gaps could emerge from 2025 onwards with a handful of coal-fired power stations dropping out of the national electricity market.“These gaps widen until all mainland states in the Nem are forecast to breach the reliability standard from 2027 onwards, with at least five coal power stations totalling approximately 13% of the Nem’s total capacity expected to retire,” said Aemo’s chief executive, Daniel Westerman.“Urgent and ongoing investment in renewable energy, long-duration storage and transmission is needed to reliably meet demand from Australian homes and businesses.”Hole 70 metres deep has opened up following collapse in Snowy Hydro tunnel, officials confirmRead moreAnother relatively mild summer in 2022-23 has helped generators avoid a repeat of last winter’s shortages.Still, the cooler conditions in eastern Australia linked to three La Niña years that have moderated electricity demand may soon give way to another El Niño, climate models indicate. El Niños are typically marked by increased prevalence of heatwaves, bushfires and droughts, all potentially challenging for the power grid.Such discussions may well feature at a meeting of climate and energy ministers from around Australia planned for this Friday in Newcastle in NSW’s Hunter Valley. The first such gathering of the year will probably get a market update, with projects in the Hunter region prominent in the Aemo report.For instance, the remaining three units of AGL Energy’s 1680-megawatt Liddell coal-fired power station are scheduled to close by the end of next month.The supply gap was meant to have been filled in part by the completion of Snowy Hydro’s 660MW Kurri Kurri gas plant, also in the Hunter Valley. Production will be delayed until the end of 2024, Aemo now says, citing Snowy’s updated forecasts.New South Wales’ – and Australia’s – largest coal-fired plant, Origin Energy’s Eraring, is presently predicted by the company to close in 2025. The Aemo report “considers” as committed the NSW government’s 700 MW/1400MW-hour Waratah Super Battery to make up for some of that shortfall from 2025-26 even though finally approval is still pending from the Australian Energy Regulator.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Queensland also has its energy challenges with the 800MW-plus Callide C plant now expected to be offline until at least 30 June, after a cooling tower collapsed last October, Aemo’s report said.The addition of 461MW of batteries and 1326MW of windfarms across the Nem helped reduce the risk of reliability gaps compared with earlier Aemo forecasts. More such projects will probably ease the threats.“The Nem has a strong pipeline of proposed generation and storage projects, totalling three times today’s generation capacity, with large-scale solar, wind and batteries accounting for 86%,” Westerman said. “Investment in firming generation, such as pumped hydro, gas and long-duration batteries, is critical to complement our growing fleet of weather-dependent renewable generation to meet electricity demand without coal generation.”Other developments that may reduce the forecast reliability risk include the HumeLink, intended to connect Snowy 2.0 to the Sydney market and Victoria’s counterpart, the VNI West link. The Victoria government announced on Monday it was speeding up work on VNI West.Queensland’s 520MW/90 MWh battery projects and 542MW/660MWh of such projects in South Australia, are among ventures in the works, Aemo said."

        "text": "Former Tory cabinet ministers have formed a group to pressure the government to improve its green policies in the hope of making it “credible” in the next general election.Alok Sharma, the former Cop26 president, is urging Rishi Sunak to have a “bold and positive environmental agenda” in the next general election. He joins the former transport secretary Chris Grayling and Simon Clarke, who was the levelling up secretary, in calling for more ambitious climate policies.They will sit on the new steering committee for the Conservative Environment Network (CEN), a group of 159 Tory MPs who pressure the government to improve its green offering. The group was formed a decade ago.The ministers will be calling for Sunak to adopt ambitious policies to unlock more onshore and offshore renewables, improve home energy efficiency, incentivise sustainable transport options, clean up rivers and seas and reward farmers for using nature-friendly practices.In recent weeks, Sunak and government ministers including the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, have criticised the Labour party for its green energy policies and the fact one of its donors also donates to the campaign group Just Stop Oil.There are fears among green Conservatives that despite hosting Cop26 and announcing a range of environmental initiatives, the Tories are in danger of losing credibility on the matter, while Labour commits to policies that include ending the moratorium on onshore wind, and vastly expanding green energy.In addition, the Tories have recently given the green light to a coalmine in Cumbria, which the government’s own net zero tsar, Chris Skidmore, said should never have been approved. Their focus appears to be on the more expensive routes such as carbon capture and storage, and nuclear power rather than cheaper, proven solutions such as insulation and onshore wind.Sharma said: “Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time. As the UK showed at Cop26, the leadership of a country with a small share of the world’s emissions can make a big difference, raising global ambitions and creating new jobs and industries at home.“The Conservative Environment Network has been a critical voice in keeping environmentalism at the heart of successive Conservative governments. I look forward to working with its many members to ensure the government has a bold and positive environmental agenda ahead of the next election.”The new group also includes the 2019 Conservative manifesto co-author Rachel Wolf, the environmental audit committee chair and MP, Philip Dunne and the MPs Katherine Fletcher and Selaine Saxby.While the Labour party attempts to focus on green issues and make them a key part of its manifesto offering, there are debates among Conservatives about whether it is worth reaching climate goals at all.Sam Hall, the director of the CEN, added: “While some conservatives remain sceptical, they are in the minority, with almost half of Conservative MPs signing up to CEN’s principles during this parliament.“The debate has moved to focus on how we deliver on our climate and nature goals in a way that enhances our prosperity and security, not whether we have to act or if humans are responsible for environmental degradation.“As we head toward the next election and the future of conservatism debate continues, we will work to ensure environmental leadership remains at the core of the centre-right politics and to urge conservatives to set out a positive agenda for further environmental action.”"

It looked like another planet,” the school principal says.A beloved brood of chickens was at the top of his list to check on.“I went over and saw the 12 chooks. They had unfortunately all perished,” Lees says. “My first job was to go and dispose of them.”As he made his way around the “stinky” campus that day – almost two years ago – the extent of what the Northern Rivers had endured became clear.“Then I went and attacked the canteen where all the freezers and fridges had fallen over into the flood water and food was already starting to rot,” Lees says.“We lost absolutely every single item in the library and pretty much everything in our kindergarten classroom. All of our sports gear, our canteen, music room and admin block was trashed.”View image in fullscreenMain Arm Upper primary school during the floods. Photograph: NSW education departmentThe nearby Main Arm Upper public school was even worse. Buildings were off their foundations, walls were coated in mud and the initial recovery was even slower due to washed out roads.The school P&C president, Bobby Henry, says the whole place was “effectively destroyed”.“It was just ruins,” he says.That was the start of a long recovery for the two communities.Kids and teachers bounced around between other local campuses, demountables and alternative classrooms.“There’s been an impact to their learning through this period – my daughter’s had to move her classroom three times this year,” Henry says.“The teachers are doing a great job at working with the kids but the reality is the facilities just weren’t there to allow it.”After more than 18 months of work including rebuilding, refencing and replanting, Henry says the school is looking even better than it did before.He marvels at the resilience of the students. But there are scars: “Every time it rains, my daughter says: ‘Is it going to flood today, Daddy?’“There’s still that little, like, sentiment in the back of her head that sits there and it’s always there and she’s constantly aware of it,” Henry says.View image in fullscreenMain Arm Upper primary school now. Photograph: NSW education departmentThe two schools will celebrate fully reopening on Monday, nearly two full school years after the floods gutted them.The education minister, Prue Car, says she is thrilled that the campus works have been completed.“I am looking forward to seeing the school communities make the most of the new facilities,” she says.Greens MP Tamara Smith pays tribute to the people who “literally saved each other during the floods” and thanks everyone who has helped reopen the schools.“For our kids at Mullum and Main Arm, they have had the trauma of the floods and landslides and the loss of their schools,” she says.“It is their strength and fortitude that inspires me to keep showing up.”The community recovery is far from over. In Mullumbimby, some people are still living with relatives, in caravans or camps of temporary “pod” homes.But Lees hopes the school’s return to full function will be a boost.“It’s had its challenges along the way but we’ve got there in the end,” he says.“We’ve got new chickens who are providing us with lots of eggs every day … The school is better than it’s ever been.”"

Scottish ministers received the UK government’s decision letter at 10pm on a Friday night, more than 12 hours after its contents being briefed to press. This is treating the Scottish parliament with contempt.“Despite discussions over the last two years, this is an 11th hour attempt by the UK government to sabotage Scotland’s deposit return scheme by forcing us to remove glass bottles.“This is at odds with all the evidence that says the biggest benefits, economically, financially and environmentally, are from including glass.“We are now going to have to look very seriously at where this leaves the viability of the Scottish scheme and talk to businesses, delivery partners and other organisations over the coming days and weeks.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "A year ago last Thursday, Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy were fleeing for their lives as a violent mob swarmed the halls of the US Capitol. With their personal safety at risk, the two most powerful Republicans on Capitol Hill at last stood up to Donald Trump. In a heated phone call, McCarthy, the House minority leader, fruitlessly implored the president to call off the mob. Senate majority leader McConnell later called the rioters “terrorists” and said Trump was “morally responsible” for the violence.The climate victories of 2021 that put fossil fuels in checkRead moreBut McConnell and McCarthy soon slunk back to enabling Trump’s assaults on democracy. They were quiet while Trump insisted the 2020 election was stolen and that anyone who disagreed must be purged from public office. They stayed mute as Trump supporters threatened violence against election officials and Republican-dominated state legislatures rewrote laws and procedures to prevent fair voting.McConnell and McCarthy have shamelessly put party ahead of country and ambition ahead of duty, setting up alarming ramifications for the future. Scientists have said for years that humanity faces a climate emergency and only rapid, far-reaching action can preserve a livable planet. On the first anniversary of the 6 January attack, it’s clear the United States also faces a democracy emergency as well. Only rapid, far-reaching action can preserve a government that is of, by, and for the people.The democracy emergency is closely linked to the climate crisis. Each is grounded in a big lie – that climate science is a hoax, that Trump won in 2020 – pushed by the same rightwing politicians and propaganda “news” outlets and embraced with cult-like devotion by Trump’s followers. Left untreated, each threatens disaster. If Trump’s forces do change enough electoral rules and personnel to guarantee victory in 2022 and beyond, there is zero chance the US government will take the strong climate action needed to avert global catastrophe.Defusing the global climate emergency therefore depends on protecting democracy. To be sure, the US is not the only country where anti-democratic trends hamper climate progress. Most of the worst laggards at November’s Cop26 climate summit were countries where authoritarianism is either entrenched or on the rise: China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, India, the US. But the collapse of US democracy would carry especially damaging climate consequences. Slashing global emissions in half by 2030, as science says is imperative, would be impossible if the world’s biggest economy and leading historical carbon emitter refuses to help.How to defuse the democracy emergency is too big a question to answer briefly. President Biden and the Democrats surely must do more; the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has promised a vote by 17 January on reforming the filibuster to pass fair voting laws. A mobilized civil society is also vital. With Trump’s followers trying to install partisans on voting boards across the land, the Atlantic’s Barton Gellman notes that democracy activists can likewise work at the local and state levels to block such skulduggery and ensure fair elections.A free press is foundational to democracy, and journalism must also rise to the occasion with outspoken coverage. Monika Bauerlein, chief executive of Mother Jones, urges the media to treat “the war on democracy” as the “big story” of 2022. The Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin says political reporters should “stop … concealing that only one party is launching a campaign to suppress votes” and “demand that Republican [officials] defend their participation in the big lie of a stolen election” – and if Republicans try to dodge, keep asking the question.Aside from Trump himself, no one deserves such journalistic grilling more than McConnell and McCarthy. As the senior Republicans in Congress, they have the stature to oppose Trump’s campaign for one-party rule. Twin profiles in cowardice, they have instead betrayed their oath to defend the constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.McConnell and McCarthy want the world to forget that a year ago Trump’s mob was hunting them down, leading each man to stand up, briefly, for democracy. But the world must not forget. The press in particular must not allow McConnell, McCarthy and most other Republicans to obscure that they are enabling the gravest threat to American democracy since the civil war – and, by so doing, encouraging a hellish climate future.This story is published as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story.

However, he dismissed the idea that the move would tie the hands of the next prime minister, following reports that the Truss campaign was worried that it was irreversible.“In the next few weeks, we will announce a government investment decision on Sizewell C where the government formally commits to the project’s financing. It allows the project to raise private capital in the markets. But it’s only at the point of the final investment decision in early 2023 that the government would formalise any equity share.”Johnson’s decision over Sizewell was challenged by a campaign to stop the nuclear reactor being built.A spokesperson for the campaign, Stop Sizewell C, said: “Whatever way you look at it, this is a very dodgy decision. Has it been made by a lame duck PM who is not supposed to tie the hands of his successor, or was it in fact made before Sizewell C was granted planning consent, lending serious weight to our conviction that this was a prejudiced, political decision?“Our next prime minister should call Sizewell C in. There are so many better ways to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money than on a project that won’t light a single lightbulb for at least a decade.”Truss has not stated a clear position on Sizewell C, but hinted last year at concerns about the involvement of China’s state-owned energy company, CGN, as part of a consortium providing funding for the preparatory work at the nuclear plant. She told the Telegraph at the time: “I think it’s very important that we don’t become strategically dependent and I think it’s important that we make sure that we’re working, particularly in areas of critical national infrastructure, with reliable partners.”EDF, the French state energy firm, worked with CGN on the first phase of the project for a new nuclear power station to sit alongside Sizewell B, which is operational, and Sizewell A, which is being decommissioned. The UK government is keen to ease CGN out, however, over concerns about Chinese involvement in sensitive assets.Johnson’s government has already put up £100m of funding this year to support the development of Sizewell C."

But at the UN climate summit this weekend, Gustavo Petro, the country’s president, committed to stop the expansion of coal, oil and gas exploitation and reorient his nation away from such “poisons”. Colombia is the first big economy to endorse a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty. This is a sensible, globally significant step – which raises the question of why other carbon-exporting OECD members, such as Britain, shouldn’t follow suit.What is crazy is that governments plan to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 that is consistent with a “safe” global temperature rise of 1.5C. The paradox the treaty seeks to address is that the Paris agreement does not mention the fossil fuels responsible for global heating. But a handful of nations could show how phasing out fossil fuels can lead to sustainable green development and rebut the absurd denialism of Sultan Al Jaber, the oil boss and Cop28 president. There are precedents: the 1997 mine ban treaty began with few backers, but was later ratified by 164 countries.Humanity is at risk if there is no transition away from an extractive growth model to a greener one. Developing nations, such as Colombia, often run deficits in energy and food while exporting low-value goods relative to their imports. Africa’s largest crude oil exporter, Nigeria, imports nearly all its fuel. Seven in 10 economies import more food than they export. Consequently, developing nations suffer a structural trade deficit that leads to a weakening currency and the need to borrow dollars. Poor nations under such a regime transfer about $2tn a year to rich ones, studies suggest.Developing nations want to replace the current inequitable model of globalisation with a fairer one. This has been done before. After 1945, West Germany was to be a “pastoral state” – dependent on others for energy, food and technology. But two years later, to keep the country from Moscow’s orbit, it was allowed to industrialise under the Marshall plan. Half the debt accumulated after two world wars was cancelled. Germany was allowed to replace imports with home-manufactured goods that, thanks to generous trade concessions, could be exported to richer nations. Despite recovering from war, the US sent Germany 5% of its GDP, about $1.5tn in today’s money.What’s needed today is a “green Marshall plan”. But former colonial powers with historical climate responsibility won’t stump up the cash. The world’s poorest countries are paying more than 12 times as much to their creditors as they are spending on preventing environmental destruction. Some resource-rich poor nations are negotiating a place in green industrial supply chains by playing the US off against China. But the Kenya-based economist Fadhel Kaboub is right: the climate emergency needs not incremental but transformational change in the trade, investment and finance architecture.Fossil fuels are today’s weapons of mass destruction, representing an existential threat. There are parallels with 1968’s treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Part of the solution to the climate emergency is to increase the use of renewables. But equally important is to stop the expansion of fossil fuel production, and not just with a vague promise that emissions will be abated in the future. Richer nations that benefited the most from coal, oil and gas extraction should commit to ending, equitably, the era of fossil fuels. Anything else, as the president of Timor-Leste, José Ramos-Horta, says, would be “crocodile tears”."

        "text": "China’s carbon emissions could peak this year before falling into a structural decline for the first time from next year after a record surge in clean energy investments, according to research.Emissions from the world’s most polluting country have rebounded this year after the Chinese government dropped its Covid restrictions in January, according to analysis undertaken for Carbon Brief.However, this rebound in fossil fuel demand emerged alongside a historic expansion of the country’s low-carbon energy sources, which was far in excess of policymakers’ targets and expectations.Beijing’s solar and wind installation targets for the year were met by September, according to the report, and the market share of electric vehicles is already well ahead of the government’s 20% target for 2025.“These record additions are all but guaranteed to push fossil-fuel electricity generation and CO2 emissions into decline in 2024,” Lauri Myllyvirta, a lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air and the author of the report.The most striking growth has been in solar power, according to Myllyvirta. Solar installations increased by 210 gigawatts (GW) this year alone, which is twice the total solar capacity of the US and four times what China added in 2020.The analysis, which is based on official figures and commercial data, found that China installed 70GW of wind power this year – more than the entire power generation capacity of the UK. It is also expected to add 7GW of hydro power and 3GW of nuclear power capacity this year, said the report.Myllyvirta said the boom in clean energy generation could trigger a decline in China’s emissions from next year despite a wave of new coal plants across the country.“This is because – for the first time – the rate of low-carbon energy expansion is now sufficient to not only meet, but exceed the average annual increase in China’s demand for electricity overall,” he said.“If this pace is maintained, or accelerated, it would mean that China’s electricity generation from fossil fuels would enter a period of structural decline – which would also be a first. Moreover, this structural decline could come about despite the new wave of coal plant permitting and construction in the country,” Myllyvirta added.China had 136GW of coal power capacity already under construction at the end of June, with a further 99GW with planning permits. Another 25GW has been permitted since then, according to the research, which would breach a policy pledge made by the country’s president, Xi Jinping, to “strictly control new coal-fired power generation projects”.China has forecast that its coal power capacity will peak at 1,370GW in 2030, which would require either an immediate end to new coal power permits, or an accelerated shutdown of existing and planned coal plants, said Myllyvirta.The findings support forecasts from energy experts that emissions from global electricity generation could reach a peak this year before a peak in all energy emissions from next year.A report by climate thinktank Ember last month found that the growth of renewables was so rapid that it was close to the rate required for the world to triple its capacity by the end of the decade to meet climate targets.In recent weeks, the International Energy Agency added that emissions from all energy sources – including fossil fuels used for heating and fuels – could peak in 2025 before starting to decline in a historic turning point for the energy industry."

They reviewed the number of deaths overall and focused on 11.1m cardiovascular deaths and 4.9m respiratory deaths. They matched this to flood and temperature data over the same period.They found mortality risks increased and persisted for up to 50 days for cardiovascular deaths and 60 days for respiratory deaths, even after the flooding had dissipated. Deaths from all causes peaked at 25 days after a flood, the study, published in the BMJ on Thursday, found.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nAmong the 35 countries or territories, up to 0.10% of all deaths, 0.18% of cardiovascular deaths, and 0.41% of respiratory deaths were attributed to floods in impacted communities. These flood-mortality associations varied by local climate type and were stronger in populations with low socioeconomic status or high proportions of people aged 65 and above.The risk of dying increased by 2.1% for all deaths, 2.6% for cardiovascular deaths and 4.9% for respiratory deaths across the 35 countries or territories.“In Australia, the impact on respiratory health was much higher than on cardiovascular disease, and in general we were in the middle of all of the countries examined” when it came to the number of deaths, said Guo, from the university’s school of public health and preventive medicine.“One problem in Australia is people in lower socioeconomic areas are more affected by flooding.”The study did not look at the exact cause of the deaths but Guo said reduced access to health services and exposure to contaminants likely played a role.“Governments need to monitor and protect people from health impacts for weeks after the event, not just in the immediate days after,” Guo said.Associate Prof Liz Hanna, from the Australian National University’s Institute for Climate, Energy & Disaster Solutions, said: “Further research needs to be done to answer these questions as to why the death rates increase so we can better target prevention strategies.”On top of the factors mentioned by Guo, Hanna said interrupted access to medications, along with stress and grief, could exacerbate existing health conditions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Plans for a floating party “island” anchored off the French Riviera have been dropped amid a row over environmental concerns.Canua Island – a 1,750 sq metre platform on a motorised trimaran designed to look like a giant floating bar – was set to open this summer 600 metres off France’s Mediterranean coast. Instead, it remains moored at the port of La Seyne-sur-Mer while awaiting permits amid a growing row among local politicians in the south of France and environmental groups.Fitted with a restaurant, bar lounge and freshwater pool and decked out with giant sun-loungers and potted plants, the “island” has been designed to accommodate up to 350 guests, who would be brought from the mainland by speedboat or arrive via yacht.The massive floating bar has been the focus of concern over the environmental impact of party projects along the southern coast, which is already built-up with beach bars and hotels. Environmental groups gathered a petition of 20,000 signatures to stop its launch.Organisers were told this week that the necessary permits to operate had been denied by the government.The French ministry of the sea told AFP: “The government’s position is that the development of an artificial island is not compatible with the need to strengthen marine environmental protections.”The ministry explained that new legislation aimed at accelerating renewable energy development had strict rules about installing any floating infrastructure at sea.“Commercial artificialisation of the maritime landscape, on a coast that is already highly urbanised, in a sea plagued by pollution, is therefore not part of logical and political ecologic policy,” the ministry said.The organisers of the Canua project, who had reportedly raised investment of approximately €16m and had been planning the project for seven years, expressed their frustration, saying they had respected environmental norms but had become caught up in politics.“It was made clear to us that we should not wait for this summer,” the project’s founders said in a statement, claiming to be “victims of a political vendetta”.The statement said: “This obstruction and political aberration, this denial of rights, leads us to take responsibility for the consequences of the situation and forces us to put an end the contracts of those who trusted us.” About 100 employees, from mechanics to bar staff, were told they were being let go.The project had the support from the mayor of one commune in the area, Mandelieu-La Napoule, where it intended to anchor, but it was notably contested by the head of the broader Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region Renaud Muselier, a member of President Emmanuel Macron’s governing party. The regional authorities said the 100 former employees would be welcome to work in other bars and restaurants along the coast that were seeking staff."

        "text": "Ivory imports from hippopotamuses, orcas and walruses will be banned under new legislation to protect the endangered species from poaching.The Ivory Act, passed in 2018, targeted materials from elephants, but a loophole meant that animals other than elephants, including hippos, were being targeted for their ivory.After a consultation, ministers have decided to tighten the ban to include all ivory-bearing species, so these will not be poached to fill the gap in the trade left by the elephant ivory ban.Ministers said the hippopotamus was the species most at risk from the trade in its ivory after elephants, and the other species were already threatened by the climate crisis. They added that continued trade in their ivory could exacerbate these threats and make their long-term survival less likely.The elephant ivory ban faced immense challenges, with antique traders taking the government to court in an ultimately unsuccessful battle to squash the legislation.Trudy Harrison, biodiversity minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said: “This is a pivotal moment in delivering one of our key manifesto commitments on international conservation.“The Ivory Act is one of the toughest bans of its kind in the world and by extending greater legal protections to five more species, we are sending a clear message the commercial trade of ivory is totally unacceptable.“The UK has long led the way in conservation and our ban shows continued global leadership in doing all we can to protect the world’s most endangered species.”Ivory is used for ornaments, musical instruments and jewellery, among other items, and animals are poached across the globe for profit in what can be a lucrative market.The hard, white material comes from the tusks and teeth of animals. It consists mainly of dentine, one of the physical structures of teeth and tusks.Charities welcomed the ban. Frances Goodrum, head of campaigns and programmes at the International Fund for Animal Welfare UK, said: “[We] are encouraged by early indications that the ban is having a significant impact on the trade in elephant ivory, yet other species are still poached globally to meet an unnecessary demand for ‘luxury’ ivory products, including the hippopotamus, walrus, narwhal, sperm whale and killer whale.“We welcome Defra’s decision to extend this powerful legislation, which will go a long way in cracking down on a damaging trade. Today is a good day for conservation and a step change towards international commitments to safeguard our natural world.”"

        "text": "The right to wild camp on Dartmoor could be under threat again after the supreme court granted permission for a wealthy landowner to bring a case against it.Last year, the Dartmoor National Park Authority won an appeal against a decision to ban wild camping on the moors.Camping had been assumed to be allowed under the Dartmoor Commons Act since 1985, until a judge ruled otherwise last January. It was the only place in England that such an activity was allowed without requiring permission from a landowner.The case hinged on whether wild camping counted as open-air recreation, leading to a long debate in the court of appeal. Lawyers acting for Alexander Darwall, the landowner, argued it was not, because when camping one was only sleeping rather than enjoying a particular activity.After the court of appeal decision, lawyers acting for Darwall, a hedge funder and Dartmoor’s sixth-largest landowner, asked the supreme court to hear the case.Darwall bought the 1,619-hectare (4,000-acre) Blachford estate on southern Dartmoor in 2013. He offers pheasant shoots, deerstalking and holiday rentals on his land.His attempts to ban wild campers from using his estate without his permission sparked a large protest movement, with thousands going to Dartmoor to assert their right to camp. It awakened a land rights debate in the UK, with the Labour party weighing in. The party previously said it would legislate for a right to wild camp in all national parks. However, it since appears to have U-turned on its land rights policy.Lewis Winks, from the Stars Are For Everyone campaign, said: “The loss of our cherished right to sleep under the stars on Dartmoor ignited a passionate and broad movement for greater land rights in England. This news is confirmation that reform is both needed and inevitable, and will act as a clarion call to all those who wish for generations to come to enjoy these fundamental freedoms.“As ever, the right to wild camp is emblematic of the fragility of our wider rights in the English countryside, and Darwall’s latest egregious move illustrates the need for greater legal protections for access to nature.“We hope that the court sees sense and returns a favourable verdict, enabling wild camping to continue on the commons of Dartmoor.”Darwall’s legal team at Landmark Chambers said that the high court held that the words in the act “unambiguously excluded a right to camp on Dartmoor” and found in favour of the landowners. The court of appeal held that it “unambiguously included a right to camp” and allowed the Dartmoor National Park Authority’s appeal. “The appeal to the supreme court will determine once and for all this important issue, namely whether members of the public enjoy a right to camp on the Dartmoor commons,” it said.“The supreme court will be asked to consider a number of principles applicable to statutory interpretation which will be of interest to practitioners. In particular, it will be invited to consider whether the court of appeal took sufficient account of admissible ‘background’ materials (i) in identifying the ‘mischief’ at which the legislation was aimed and (ii) in considering whether the statutory language was ambiguous.”"

        "text": "A team of researchers has filed a complaint against Tesco, saying its “biodegradable” teabags do not fulfil that claim following an experiment that involved burying them in soil for a year to see what happened.Dr Alicia Mateos-Cárdenas from University College Cork (UCC) set out to investigate how well teabags advertised as biodegradable broke down. She buried 16 Tesco Finest Green Tea with Jasmine pyramid teabags in garden soil. However, when the teabags were dug up, they remained intact.She checked them at three weeks, just over three months, six months and 12 months, and found no change. She flagged her paper to two researchers at the UCC’s Environmental Law Clinic, who have now collectively reported the supermarket to a consumer protection watchdog in Ireland.The complaint says that a customer would reasonably expect a product labelled as biodegradable to break down in the open environment within a year, or sooner. The Tesco Finest Green Tea with Jasmine pyramid bags showed no signs of degradation after 12 months due to the type of bioplastic they are made from, according to the complaint sent to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC).Dr Alicia Mateos Cárdenas tests teabags in the laboratory. Photograph: Courtesy of Dr Alicia Mateos CárdenasThe company has recently changed suppliers but the academics argue that the teabags are still made from the same plant-based bioplastic, called polylactic acid (PLA).Tesco said that the packaging clearly states that its teabags are not approved to be disposed of in soil or home composting, but need to be industrially composted (having been put in a local council food waste bin). A Tesco spokesperson said: “We strongly dispute the claims made in this study and believe that the findings are misleading. The method of decomposing teabags used in the study does not reflect the on-pack advice we give customers.“All our own-brand herbal teabags have been certified as industrially compostable, which means they can be disposed of in food caddies and council collections, biodegrading with organic matter through in-vessel composting. We do not advise customers to dispose of these teabags in home compost bins or soil.”The researchers say Tesco should change “biodegradable” to “plant-based” or “compostable” if they cannot rot down in gardens or compost bins. “It is fair to assume that any PLA teabag will not biodegrade in the open environment,” said Mateos-Cárdenas, from the School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences at UCC, who published a paper on the biodegradability of teabags in Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology. Her findings formed the basis of the subsequent complaint.“The fact that they come from another supplier is meaningless,” she said. “We have proven that Tesco is misleadingly selling their teabags using greenwashing practices. We are hoping that the CCPC will urgently act.”Given that the teabag showed no sign of disintegration after a year, it is reasonable to believe it could persist in the soil for much longer, the researchers argue. If the average consumer has two cups of tea a day, they could have more than 700 teabags in their home compost bin or in the garden after one year. This renders Tesco’s claim “not only false, but also misleading and unsubstantiated” under Irish and EU consumer protection legislation, the complaint says.The researchers want investigators to look into the broader issue of retailers making misleading claims about materials biodegrading, with such claims being “rife”.‘It’s greenwash’: most home compostable plastics don’t work, says studyRead more“It is incumbent upon Tesco and others to ensure that their products live up to their advertised claims,” said Mindy O’Brien, coordinator of Voice of Irish Concern for the Environment, who is calling on the CCPC to investigate the claim to avoid further greenwashing. “Now more than ever, consumers are motivated to purchase a product that appears to be more sustainable. There is no room for false or misleading green claims.”The complaint follows research led by Prof Mark Miodownik from University College London which found most plastics marketed as “home compostable” don’t actually work, with as much as 60% failing to disintegrate after six months.“The results do not surprise me,” he said, commenting on this latest research, which he was not involved in.“If the product hangs around for years before biodegrading, which is the reality for many products labelled biodegradable, they are part of the problem not the solution. There are innovative companies out there trying to make a difference, but they don’t use the term biodegradable because they know it’s code for greenwash.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"

When such credits are sold within offset schemes they in effect legitimise additional carbon emissions that contribute to global heating.In particular there is an inherent flaw in offset projects based on avoided deforestation. In principle the idea of avoided deforestation is sound. Forest owners and forested countries in the global south should be financially incentivised to reduce their deforestation beneath an agreed baseline rate.But to use avoided deforestation as a basis for creating carbon credits lets greenhouse gas emitters claim they are contributing to net zero emissions. In reality, avoided deforestation projects only maintain existing carbon stock capacity in forests. They do not add to this capacity, hence cannot offset additional emissions. Carbon offset projects only make sense when net forest cover is increased. Until that happens, the carbon offset market is not a case of net zero emissions but of zero credibility.David HumphreysEmeritus professor of environmental policy, Open University The shortcomings of carbon offsets also hold true for biodiversity offsets, which have been promoted as a way of saving forests. But there’s a new kid on the block – biocredits, a new kind of financial asset identified as units of biodiversity that are measurable and traceable and so can be traded and sold to individuals, corporates and government. They can be a positive investment in improved conservation in ways that also benefit Indigenous peoples and local communities.Our research shows that pilot schemes for biocredits are emerging all over the world, but need to avoid the setbacks faced by carbon credit and carbon offset markets, specifically in making sure the metrics they use to define a unit of biodiversity include its social and cultural value. The United Nations is facilitating the development of a standard methodology, as are certifiers Plan Vivo, Verra and Gold Standard. This all bodes well for the rapid implementation of a mechanism with the potential to save the world’s forests.Paul Steele and Anna DucrosInternational Institute for Environment and Development Your article (18 January) cites academics who take issue with highly technical elements of the methodologies used to determine the amount of emissions reductions by projects that avoid deforestation and forest degradation to generate carbon credits. But many other experts support the current technical elements. The article did not fairly represent the views of both sides. Debates among scientists risk being misunderstood and taken out of context by the wider community, with unintended consequences. This is of particular concern when the science is not yet peer-reviewed, as is the case of the research that the article heavily relies on.Achieving the Paris climate agreement’s net zero goal requires the rapid expansion of carbon markets. Carbon credit standards organisations, such as Verra, provide the science-based methodologies that drive quality, action and supply within voluntary carbon markets. All new methodologies are open to public consultation, where scientific input is considered – and where critics should present their views.Dirk ForristerPresident and CEO, International Emissions Trading Association"

What can lay an egg? An orange-peel doris can lay an egg in a tidal pool; a bee hummingbird can lay an egg the size of an aspirin; an auk on a cliff lays a conical egg, which will roll around in a circle instead of forwards and off the edge; a spider wraps her egg in silk, places it on a stalk, then lays another.A sea snake: like a nightmare generated by a sleep app | Helen SullivanRead moreTo Linda Pastan, an egg was “a moon / glowing faintly / in the galaxy of the barn”. Approach it, and Louise Glück will tell you: “The thing is hatching. Look.” One egg looks – apart from its size, the sharpness of its point, or its colour – much like another: they are all pleasing in the same way, hard-shelled and soft-shaped. “An egg is the most beautiful of all / beautiful forms, a box without corners / in which anything can be contained,” wrote Elizabeth Spires. This one structure, variations on round, can hold things shaped as differently as: a snake, an auk, a platypus; an emu, a tortoise, a peacock.An egg, unfertilised, is one giant cell. The bee hummingbird’s tiny egg is a single cell. An ostrich’s enormous egg is a single cell. In South Africa, my father scrambled an ostrich egg for breakfast: it was enough for 15 people.The ovum is the largest cell in the human body, and the only one that can be seen with the naked eye. At 20 weeks old, the foetus that became my daughter held within her body every egg she would have for the rest of her life. So, for many days, many years ago, my mother held in her body the egg that would become my daughter. And for 30 years I carried the egg cell that became my daughter with me wherever I went, even as almost every other cell in my body replaced itself multiple times.An earthworm: when you are a child, these are an enormous part of your world | Helen SullivanRead more“I remembered something I’d read in the book I’d lifted from the charity shop in Brighton,” Ali Smith writes in Artful, “about birds’ eggs, how the egg of a bird is crystalline, made of layers lined with minuscule air canals so the chick inside can breathe; how the thickness of each egg’s shell meets exactly the pressure each incubating bird will bring to bear on it.”Should a fleck of shell fall into the egg when you crack it into the bowl, the thing that works best to remove it is another piece of shell.

Another stretches like a dog, yawns and lies down, when something glides behind the harbour of its back like a yacht. There is no rise and fall in the movement of the body, with its short, cryptic, brown, black and white strokes. I blink and look away, refocus. There is a hare-like goggle-eye between wheat blades; a wild little sun with a small black planet dotted within. Pictures in field guides pop up like sleeping tabs in my brain: a stone-curlew. Two. Two stone-curlews.The first bird sails slowly back into view, the plimsoll line of a wing bar of white feathers aligned with the top of the young wheat. It stays straight as a spirit level as it cruises through the field. At a gap in the precision-drilled crop, it suddenly stands tall, and I realise that it has been travelling along in comedy subterfuge on bent knees, or hocks; these are the “thick knees” of its family name (Burhinus oedicnemus); it is not, in fact, a curlew. There is something else maritime about it; not just the smooth movement, or the white wing bar of fluttering bunting – its long yellow legs and its wader-short thick bill are in the same yachtsmen’s welly yellow. It makes me smile.A good-looking bird: the bush stone-curlew that loves its own reflectionRead moreThe second bird stands too and the pair are together in a patch of sunlight, vivid against blue sky. I can see the way their crepuscular‑evolved eyes bulge and angle downwards, and how it matches the sad-clown-smile curve of their bill. They are mad and beautiful and clearly nesting, as the second bird settles back down and the first lowers the great hinges of his legs and stalks away.The vulnerability of these ground-nesting birds is brought home as a tractor appears in the field. I make a frantic run to flag it down. The farmer stops, dismounts from his cab and listens. He is kind, interested and tells me, if I get the What3words reference for the birds’ position, he’ll enter it into his tractor’s computer, populate it across the little fleet and the GPS will avoid them. I am incredulous. High-tech agriculture really can be a friend to farmland birds. Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"

        "text": "Campaigners have raised concerns over a potential conflict of interest for the new UK environment secretary, Steve Barclay, whose wife is a senior executive at Anglian Water.Barclay took on the environment role in Rishi Sunak’s cabinet reshuffle this week. His wife, Karen Barclay, holds a senior position at the water company, as head of major infrastructure (DCO) planning and stakeholder engagement.As secretary of state, Barclay is responsible for overseeing the regulation of water companies. He is responsible for ensuring the water firms make improvements regarding sewage pollution via the government’s storm overflow reduction plan.Anglian Water is one of six companies under investigation by the regulator Ofwat for potential illegal dumping of raw sewage. The Environment Agency is separately in the middle of a huge criminal investigation into illegal sewage dumping by water companies involving more than 2000 water treatment works.Anglian Water ad banned by regulator over pollution recordRead moreWater companies are pressing government and the regulator Ofwat to approve £96bn investment in infrastructure improvements to fix leaks, stop sewage discharges and build more capacity at treatment plants, which they want customers to pay for via bill rises. Many critics say the public has already paid once for the investment, and should not be made to pay again for fixing problems which put the companies in breach of their legal duties.Tim Farron, the rural spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said: “Ministers’ spouses do of course have the right to their own careers, but I do worry about the possible conflict of interest here for the man charged with forcing the water companies to clean up their act.“We need to make sure the secretary of state is fully committed to doing everything in his power to stop the sewage scandal.”This summer, Anglian Water pleaded guilty to allowing millions of litres of untreated sewage to overflow from a water recycling centre in Essex. It was fined £2.65m, the largest penalty imposed for environmental offences in the east of England region.Ashley Smith, of Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, said there was a possible conflict of interest for the new secretary of state.“It’s not just that the new environment secretary’s wife holds a senior post at Anglian Water, it is the fact that the water industry routinely operates outside the law, has misappropriated billions of bill payers’ money and now holds the country to ransom to hike bills to fix the mess it made and cannot be trusted to not make off with another windfall gifted by government,” said Smith.A government spokesperson said: “All Defra ministers declare their interests in line with the ministerial code.“There is an established regime in place for the declaration and management of interests held by ministers. This ensures that steps are taken to avoid or mitigate any potential or perceived conflicts of interest.”Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, who chairs Anglian Water’s independent challenge board, said: “It would prudent for him to make sure this has been declared publicly and that it is all out in the open. Then it is something that can be managed.”Karen Barclay has been approached for a comment. Anglian Water did not comment. The image on this article was replaced on 14 November 2023.

It’s been a few days now so people will be experiencing breathing difficulties and other impacts like irritated sinuses. They are staying indoors and working from home where possible.”Chrissy, a 28 year old from Sydney, said she had to buy an air purifier to get through the smoky days.“[The smoke] definitely worsened my asthma. I found myself being a little tighter in the chest, coughing, and having to take my puffers more often,” she said.“And the past couple days of increased smoke has been a little frustrating and stressful, I’ve had to stay indoors where possible, and I’ve bought a air purifier to be able to cope.Chrissy, who asked that her full name not be used, said she was anxious about the upcoming bushfire season.“I am just planning ahead, making sure that I have a good supply of puffers and access to a space with air conditioning.”"

        "text": "Labour is having to turn away business leaders who want to attend special events at its party conference in Liverpool next month because too many have applied in the belief that Keir Starmer will form the next government.Party insiders say that a full complement of 200 senior business people have signed up at a cost of £2,520 each to attend a special business forum on the Monday of the conference with Starmer, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds.Another 180 have been put on a waiting list and will only be able to attend if others drop out. Last year only 130 attended.In a rush of interest that has taken officials by surprise, a total of 300 chief executives and chairs of big UK companies will be attending the conference – more than did so during the first term of Tony Blair’s prime ministership. Business sponsorship has more than doubled since last year, when it totalled £200,000, to £500,000 this year, officials say.Evidence that business is fully expecting a Labour government comes as corporate interest in the Tories slumps, with many consultancies and other companies turning their attentions away from lobbying the Conservatives to trying to make contacts with Labour. One head of a London-based consultancy said: “I think it will be pretty dead at the Tories’ [conference]. People will spend their money on who they think will be the next government.”While many business leaders are yet to be entirely convinced by Labour’s policy agenda – with many wanting it to go further and faster in addressing the damage caused by Brexit – there is strong interest in the party’s green prosperity plan that aims to learn from the Biden administration through public-private partnership in building a new green economy.Joe Biden’s $369bn (£296bn) Inflation Reduction Act, directed at zero-carbon energy projects such as solar, wind and nuclear, involves giving huge grants to bring manufacturers of renewable energy products to the US, as well as consumer incentives for purchasing electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps and electric stoves.Labour’s green prosperity plan, led by shadow net zero secretary Ed Miliband, draws on elements of Biden’s strategy, using the power of the state to work with businesses to invest in the industries and resources necessary to achieve net zero, with the aim of bringing down energy prices through the use of more renewable energy and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process.Like the Biden approach, Labour would launch itself on a new course, using state resources, including regulation and subsidies, to attract industries to co-invest with the public sector in technologies for renewable power, the production of EVs and heat pump installation.One senior figure in the renewable energy field who will be attending the Labour conference said: “The feeling in the industry is that we are just seeing out time with the Tories. They have shown that they are not really committed to the agenda. For Labour, it is central to their economic plans.”Labour has also had to find five new overspill areas within the conference centre in recent weeks for businesses’ stalls after high levels of demand. So far, 287 organisations have applied for space for their exhibits, which is believed to be a record. The party has also decided to stage a special business conference in February in London.Speaking to the Observer, Reynolds said that interest in Labour from business was huge, with companies having given up on the Tories.They were, he said, interested in his party’s industrial strategy, which included targets such as “making Brexit work”, reforms to planning to allow more houses to be built, and changes to the apprenticeship levy, enabling companies to spend up to 50% of their levy contributions on non-apprenticeship training.This weekend sees the opening of the TUC conference in Liverpool, where unions will demand more action from the government to solve the Raac (reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete) crisis in schools and other public buildings and put pressure on a future Labour government to look again at plans for a wealth tax in order to better fund public services.Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, the country’s largest union, which represents more than 1.3 million workers, said that in the light of the school concrete crisis and erosion of other parts of the public realm, the next government had to show a different attitude to the funding of public services.“I hope and believe that is where Labour is … that they don’t always think that you have to go out and cut and slash public services.“We want the next government to see that public services are a good thing in themselves and are not a drain on society – that good public services help build an economy, build a community, and help people go out to work and businesses to thrive.”"

        "text": "On a chilly autumn morning not long ago, Annalise Klingbeil and eight others packed into three cars, departing Calgary in the dark as they drove westward towards the Rockies.They were hoping to take in the region’s larch season, when the needles of the spiny trees transform a brilliant shade of yellow.But when they arrived at Moraine lake, the sun still hanging behind Banff’s jagged peaks, their adventure was cut short.“We got to the parking lot before 6am and it was packed. It was like a tailgate party. People camped the night. Some are eating oatmeal from the back of their vehicles, having their coffee, said Klingbeil, a communications consultant who also runs the popular GoOutside newsletter with her sister, Cailynn. “It was just nuts.”With the number of visitors growing each year, Parks Canada recently announced it will ban private vehicles along the road to Moraine lake in 2023 in an effort to ease congestion at Banff’s most popular tourist attraction.The tension between showcasing the region’s natural wonders and preserving them for generations to come is not a new issue for the country’s federal parks agency. In recent years, Parks Canada has closed down certain hiking trails and weighed the possibility of visitor caps to more sensitive areas.But the challenges of administering the park have grown more complicated amid a growing political row between the western province of Alberta and the federal government.This week, Alberta’s minister of forests, parks and tourism Todd Loewen called on Parks Canada to reverse its decision, suggesting the ban would harm tourism, give residents “less access” to the backcountry and mark the end of “sunrise and sunset hikes or night photography”.Canadian Rockies and Moraine lake in Banff national park, Canada. Photograph: lucky-photographer/AlamyIn response, Parks Canada said the Moraine lake parking lot is at capacity 24 hours a day, and that while 900 vehicles successfully gain access to the lake each day during the summer, nearly 5,000 are turned away, with drivers often directing their frustration at parks staff. The agency said the sheer demand for parking spaces far exceeds capacity and says it will rely on a shuttle option for visitors.Speaking to a local radio station, Loewen pushed back, suggesting instead that the federal agency build a bigger parking lot.The idea prompted scorn from Klingbeil who pointed out that such a move would be banned by law. “With this suggestion, he comes across like he knows absolutely nothing about this issue,” she said.She argued that there was an urgent need to ban private vehicles, but also to create a cultural shift when it comes to private vehicles in public spaces.“For a lot of Albertans, ‘car equals freedom’ and they see their car as something they go to the mountains in. But if you’re seeing 5,000 vehicles a day, being turned away from this place, like, something’s got to give.”The row over parks has come amid broader political tensions between the federal government and Alberta, which recently passed a controversial “sovereignty act”, which could allow the province to ignore federal laws – setting the stage for potential conflict with both Ottawa and Indigenous nations.In November, Alberta’s premier, Danielle Smith, said she wanted tourism money generated in the five national parks within Alberta to remain in the province, rather than being used to maintain other parks across the country.But Smith’s governing United Conservatives have a checkered record on parks in the province.In 2020, as austerity measures in the oil-rich province took hold under former premier Jason Kenney, the provincial government announced plans to shutter a number of provincial parks. Alberta also proposed allowing private businesses to operate others parks in an effort to save money, arguing a number of the parks fail to generate significant revenues. The idea prompted outcry and was later dropped.But the future of Canada’s parks, who uses them and who sets the rules, is set to become an increasingly tense issue as the cost of popularity takes its toll on vulnerable ecosystems.“Albertans love going outside. They love their parks. It’s their church: they’re special, sacred, peaceful and energizing places,” said Klingbeil. “They love it. But they’re asking, ‘What about my children? And what about my grandchildren?’“Parks Canada needs to make some big changes going forward in order to preserve these spaces for future generations.”"

        "text": "Poland’s probable new government can shed its reputation as a “climate laggard” but will still struggle to cut emissions quickly, environment and energy groups have said.The rightwing Law and Justice party (PiS), which has ruled Poland since 2015 and has slammed the brakes on climate action at home and in the EU, is unlikely to form a government despite having won the most votes in parliamentary elections on 15 October. Analysts expect a more climate-friendly coalition between the centrist Civic Coalition, the centre-right Third Way and the leftwing Lewica parties.The three opposition parties have promised to build more clean energy infrastructure, and to cut carbon emissions more quickly than before.“It’s a landmark moment in modern Polish history,” said Zuzanna Rudzińska-Bluszcz, the head of the Polish branch of ClientEarth, a not-for-profit environmental organisation. “Although our spirits are high, we need to remain mindful about the challenges that lie ahead.”Civic Coalition, the main opposition party led by Donald Tusk, a former prime minister and European Council president, says it will move to quickly clean up Poland’s coal-heavy power sector. It aims to generate 65% of electricity from renewable sources and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 75% by the end of the decade, but has not released plans for how to do so.Lewica has also called for a faster expansion of renewable energy and promised to carry out “a thorough modernisation” of the country’s electricity grids. Third Way, which has only a short section on climate in its manifesto, has campaigned for more energy independence with the slogan “a power plant in every home”.Joanna Maćkowiak-Pandera, the president of the energy thinktank Forum Energii, said: “There is quite a lot of consistency on energy and climate issues within the parties that are likely to form the government. The level of ambition is also high.”But the broad coalition may struggle to agree on policies to reach their targets, analysts say, particularly on topics outside renewable energy. They are also likely to face opposition from coal workers’ unions and a president with veto powers until 2025.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In its manifesto, Civic Coalition has said it will freeze gas prices next year at their 2023 levels for households and sensitive customers.Poland, which burns more coal than any other country in Europe, has for years resisted EU policies that cut emissions. In July, the government filed cases with the European court of justice to stop EU rules that would tighten the carbon market, set targets to reduce emissions and ban sales of cars that burn fossil fuels.At home, PiS and its minor partner parties alarmed doctors and scientists with a promise to mine coal until 2049. The International Energy Agency expects rich countries to quit coal by 2030 if they are serious about keeping global heating to 1.5C.But another wing of PiS took a more pragmatic approach, with the partial liberalisation of a de facto ban of new onshore wind power projects that had been imposed in 2016, according to Michał Smoleń, who runs the energy and climate programme at the thinktank Fundacja Instrat.The government also pushed subsidy schemes for some clean technologies such as rooftop solar panels and heat pumps even as its rhetoric on climate action hardened. Poland’s heat-pump market recorded the biggest growth of any EU member state in 2022, according to industry data, as people in polluted cities ditched coal-burning stoves and avoided gas boilers because of high energy prices.“In general the transformation is taking place,” said Rudzińska-Bluszcz. “But in declarations, they treat coal as Polish gold.”"

        "text": "Antarctica has likely broken a new record for the lowest annual maximum amount of sea ice around the continent, beating the previous low by a million square kilometres.The new mark is the latest in a string of records for the continent’s sea ice, as scientists fear global heating could have shifted the region into a new era of disappearing ice with far reaching consequences for the world’s climate and sea levels.Each September Antarctica’s sea ice reaches its maximum extent. The average between 1981 and 2010 was 18.71m sq km.‘Something weird is going on’: search for answers as Antarctic sea ice stays at historic lowsRead moreBut the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) said preliminary analysis suggested the sea ice reached a maximum of 16.96m sq km on 10 September and had fallen away since then.The 2023 maximum was 1.75m sq km below the long term average and about 1m sq km below the previous record low maximum set in 1986.Dr Will Hobbs, a sea ice scientist at the University of Tasmania, said that since April the rate of growth in Antarctica’s sea ice had been “very, very slow”.“This isn’t just a big change from the average, but also from the previous record,” he said. “In May it was pretty obvious we were in for something spectacular.”He said sea ice losses in the Ross Sea region were likely down to winds that had pushed the ice against the continent, bringing warm air. But weather couldn’t explain why ice was lost around the rest of the continent.The extend of Antarctica’s sea ice on 24 September 2023. Photograph: National Snow and Ice Data Centre, University of Colorado BoulderAntarctica’s sea ice goes through an annual cycle reaching its lowest extent each February and its highest levels in September.Antarctica’s sea ice had been relatively stable until a new record summer low was broken in 2016. Since then, further record lows have been set, including this February that broke the record for the lowest summer minimum.Scientists are still trying to untangle the reasons for the dramatic run of records, with natural variability and global heating likely combining.Hobbs said in his view the “scientific barrier” had not yet been crossed to allow scientists to say with confidence the records were down to global heating. But he said the loss of sea ice was consistent with climate change projections.NSIDC said the losses of sea ice since 2016 were most likely linked to warming of the upper layer of the ocean.“There is some concern that this may be the beginning of a long-term trend of decline for Antarctic sea ice, since oceans are warming globally, and warm water mixing in the Southern Ocean polar layer could continue,” the centre said in an update.Thousands of emperor penguins chicks likely died last year after the break-up of usually stable sea ice at four of their colonies.Dr Ariaan Purich, a climate scientist specialising in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean at Monash University, said the top 300 metres of the Southern Ocean around the continent had been noticeably warmer since 2016.“But as to why the sea ice has been so much lower than it has ever been on the record, we still don’t have a good grasp on that yet.”Antarctica may have entered ‘new regime’ of low sea ice as global warming ramps upRead moreShe said the loss of sea ice had far-reaching consequences for the planet. Sea ice helps protect the land-based ice from entering the ocean, which could push up sea level by several metres.Sea ice also reflects the sun’s energy back out to space. She said with less sea ice, more of the ocean is exposed to the sun’s energy, causing further Southern Ocean warming and further loss of ice.“Scientists are worried. I’m worried that it looks low sea ice is the future – and it’s here now.”"

Failure to do so will have implications for the long-term viability of important regional industries and jobs, especially in tourism and aquaculture.”\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nPlibersek said environment officials were examining three requests – from the Australia Institute, the Bob Brown Foundation and the Environmental Defenders’ Office – for a “reconsideration” of whether the salmon industry had the approvals it needed to operate in Macquarie Harbour. If the requests were found to have legal validity it would trigger “a broad consultation” with the state government, the salmon industry, its workers, their union and the community.“If the reconsideration finds that the salmon industry in Macquarie Harbour does not have the necessary environmental approvals, [national environment law] would require operations to pause while approvals are sought,” Plibersek said.“But I will look at any action I can take, consistent with my legal obligations… to support the Tasmanian government regulator, and the salmon farming industry, to put their operations on a truly sustainable footing.”A decision to reconsider the approval of farms owned by Tassal, Petuna and Huon Aquaculture would likely spark a fierce response from the industry, and be opposed by it supporters in the Liberal state government and Labor opposition.Writing in the Mercury last month, Luke Martin, the chief executive of the lobby group Salmon Tasmania, said: “Let’s be clear, this industry will not concede one single fish or one single job, and we caution environment minister Tanya Plibersek from being captive to loud green groups as she considers the future of the skate.”Martin said salmon farming was one of several industries that operated in the harbour, and the scale of the industry had been reduced in 2017 without dissolved oxygen levels improving.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scientists from the University of Tasmania said the species could be one extreme weather event from extinction.Eloise Carr, Tasmanian director of the Australia Institute, said Plibersek’s letter showed the federal government was “taking the impacts of salmon farming on water quality seriously”. She said the industry and state government were trying to pressure the minister “to ignore the evidence”.The federal and state governments each recently announced $2.1m funding to set up a captive breeding program to create a skate “insurance population”.

        "text": "Prescriptions encouraging people to spend more time in nature are linked to reduced blood pressure and improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms, according to new analysis.Doctors sometimes use nature-based social prescription programs – sometimes described as “green prescriptions” or “blue prescriptions” – to advise patients to spend time in green spaces or near bodies of water.Prescribing nature: the restorative power of a simple dose of outdoorsRead moreAustralian academics reviewed existing research into the impacts and effectiveness of nature prescribing in different countries, looking at 92 studies in which participants spent time engaging with nature in various capacities.The most frequently recommended activities were walking in nature (46% of all programs), farming or gardening (29%) and mindfulness exercises (29%).Common settings were forests and nature reserves (35% of prescriptions), parks (28%) and community or home gardens (16%).A meta-analysis of data in 28 of the studies that measured similar outcomes found that nature prescriptions were associated with better blood pressure control, improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms, and an increase in average daily step counts among participants.Prof Thomas Astell-Burt, a population health expert at the University of Wollongong who co-led the research, said the improvements were interlinked. “You go out for a walk out in a green space which helps with fitness – that also helps to improve your mental health, reduces loneliness, improves sleep, and can also help to reduce one’s blood pressure. These outcomes aren’t independent of each other.“It’s good for mental health, good for physical health [and] good for keeping active.”One-fifth of all the programs reviewed were administered in South Korea, followed by the US (17%) and Japan (11%).The researchers found the analysed research had a “moderate to high risk of bias” due to challenges in designing blinded studies in the area. “It’s very difficult to hide from a person whether they’re in the intervention or the control group if the intervention is ‘spend more time outdoors in a park’ and the control is ‘don’t’,” Astell-Burt said.Co-lead researcher Prof Xiaoqi Feng of the University of New South Wales School of Population Health said more randomised controlled trials were required to “reveal how effective and cost-effective nature prescriptions can be over a sustained period of time, and also what kinds of nature prescriptions work for whom”.Astell-Burt and Feng last month secured $1.5m in funding through the Medical Research Future Fund for a trial testing the effectiveness of nature prescriptions in Australians over 45 years old.Feng said the research team was designing the trial in combination with consumers, healthcare providers and nature professional so that “when we have the … results, we are well-positioned to roll [programs] out nationwide”.In Australia, nature prescriptions are not commonplace. However, research in nearly 47,000 Australians has previously found that in urban areas, 30% green space or tree canopy cover was beneficial to health, lowering the odds of experiencing diabetes and psychological distress.The study was published in the Lancet Planetary Health."

The obvious answer is bread,” she said.“Ninety-six per cent of people in the UK eat bread, and 90% of that is white bread, which in most cases contains soya. We’ve already performed some experiments and found that fava bean flour can directly replace imported soya flour and some of the wheat flour, which is low in nutrients. We can not only grow the fava beans here, but also produce and test the fava bean-rich bread, with improved nutritional quality.”The project is backed by £2m of government funding and brings together the researchers, farmers and policymakers to encourage British consumers to eat more broad beans, which mostly go towards animal feed at present.

It is hoped that faba bean will improve satiety, as well as providing enhanced nutritional benefits in products that are enjoyable to eat.” This article was amended on 19 January 2023 to make clear that fava beans are also known as faba beans."

They are more likely to help a family member in distress than a stranger.The study, from scientists at Monash University and the Australian National University, tracked the beloved songbirds in the first research to focus on understanding how animals that live in a multi-level society, like humans, decide to help one another when in need.The study, published in Current Biology, tested this by placing nearby a fake kookaburra, which is a predator of the superb fairywren, and then broadcasting a call of distress which was varied according to social relations.‘Tiny little balls of pure joy’: why the superb fairywren took our 2021 Australian bird of the yearRead moreWhen a member of a superb fairywren’s family is being attacked, the researchers found it will risk life and limb to distract the predator. The bird will raise an alarm call, or puff up its plumage and scurries around like a mouse in what is known as a “rodent run”.“It was a remarkable thing to watch,” said Prof Robert Magrath, a study co-author from the ANU. “It’s like the bird changes costume to something very strange.”But if the superb fairywren being attacked is an acquaintance, the researchers found it will help but not as intensely. If the attacked superb fairywren is a stranger, it will ignore the cries for help altogether.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n“[It] was really quite astonishing how big a variation there was in how much help was provided,” Magrath said.Ettore Camerlenghi, the lead author of the study and a PhD candidate at Monash University, said that, like humans, superb fairywrens have a core social group.“We found the wrens, like hunter-gatherers, have three distinct types of relations – those from the same breeding group, familiar individuals from the same community and unfamiliar birds from the wider population,” Camerlenghi said.The superb fairywren is one of Australia’s most loved birds and was voted the 2021 bird of the year in the Guardian Australia/BirdLife Australia poll. The poll will return later this year.BirdLife Australia’s Sean Dooley said it was the complexity and quirkiness of superb fairywrens’ social lives, like those revealed in the research, that made the bird a favourite among Australians.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Female superb fairywrens sport the same brown and white plumage year-round.The birds are one of the most frequently encountered small bush birds in BirdLife Australia’s annual bird count, Dooley said, but the numbers were drastically declining in urban and outer-urban areas.BirdLife Australia is a partner in a citizen science project that will guide habitat restoration of superb fairywrens in inner Melbourne by tracking where the birds live and forage."

        "text": "Sweden is one step closer to making the use of methane-reducing cow feed additives such as seaweed government policy after experts recommended further investigation into the area.A report by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency into reduced methane emissions says development in the field has been “rapid in recent years” and is among “a number of new interesting additives with higher potential”.Among the cow feed additives cited in the report were the seaweed red algae and the chemical 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP).According to manufacturers, the daily feeding of red algae (where the active substance is bromoform) can reduce the methane emissions of meat animals by up to 90%. But, the agency said, more knowledge on cultivation and use was needed.3-NOP, which has been fed to several cattle categories in Sweden and elsewhere, has been approved for use in dairy cows in the EU since February 2022. The chemical can cut methane emissions by an average of about 30% in dairy cows, according to the report, and by 45% in meat cattle.The discovery about the effects of feeding seaweed was originally made by researchers in Australia and works by preventing microorganisms in the cow’s first stomach from producing methane.While some feed additives “appear to have significant potential”, it warns that there is still uncertainty over the long-term effects and factors preventing it from being used more within production systems.“More research and analysis is required both in terms of today’s marketed products and to develop alternative, future feed additives,” says the report.As a result of its findings, the study proposes that the government commission the agency, along with other authorities, to further investigate the area.Lines of inquiry, it says, should include socioeconomic impact, support for farmers and other stages in the food chain, improved research, innovation initiatives and increased collaboration with the industry.Other potential areas of investigation for “climate-smart cows”, it says, are enhancing productivity and genetic variations between breeds on how much methane they produce.In 2021, Sweden’s agricultural sector produced 3.6m tonnes of CO2 equivalents of methane – 2.9m tonnes of which were produced by cattle digestion.Emma Carlen, a climate analyst at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, said: “We believe that this [methane-reducing feed additives] can be a measure to reduce the methane from cattle in Sweden. We don’t have very many other measures that can have this affect within current production level. But we also believe it’s still quite new and there’s still more research to be done before we can really come in with a clear policy measure.”The extra cost of such measures was a big constraint for farmers, she said, which is why they wanted to look at what financial support might be needed, as well as other measures.Fredrik Åkerman, the co-founder and CEO of Volta Greentech, which is developing a land-based seaweed factory on the west coast of Sweden to make cattle feed, said in its pilot projects across two Swedish farms so far it had reduced cows’ methane emissions by 80% a day.Next year, the company, which started five years ago, is planning another pilot project at a commercial beef farm in the UK.“We have developed a strategy that makes cows burp and fart less methane emissions,” he said. “So the additive is included into the cow feed and we have now been able, in several commercial pilot projects, to reduce 80% of emissions per day that the cows emit, which is of course making a big positive impact on climate change and agriculture.”By installing a sensor on the farm, they are able to measure methane emissions before and after the introduction of the feed, data which is then verified by a third party.The report’s recommendations are vital for the industry’s development, said Åkerman. “To maintain profitability in the industry, it’s quite difficult for us to sell a product that costs money to reduce emissions if the incentives are not there. So the policy development is very important,” he added. “It has been lagging behind other industries."

It says they have greater value if treated as a carbon and biodiversity sink than if logged to produce mainly low-value products such as woodchips, pallets and power poles.Released on Wednesday, the report recommends the government salvage and expand Australia’s struggling plantation sector by creating a state-owned national plantation estate to “increase our domestic timber independence”.Labor faces internal fight over native forest logging despite emissions pledgeRead moreNearly 90% of Australian timber comes from plantations, and just 12% from native forests, but next to no tree farms have been planted since 2010 and total plantation area is in decline. Government modelling suggests at least 400,000 hectares of new plantations will be needed over the next decade to meet demand.Felicity Wade, Lean’s co-convener, said the evidence suggested expanding plantations could create 1,800 regional jobs, compared with 1,100 employed in the native forest industry nationally. She said 316 party branches across 100 electorates supported stopping native forest logging on economic and environmental grounds, and focusing on developing a plan to build a “vibrant 21st century plantation-based timber industry”.“We have some of the most carbon- and biodiversity-rich forests on the planet and we’re mining them. What a waste,” Wade said.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n“Lean believes we need publicly owned plantation establishment, done smart. We need to plan what species need to be planted and where, with a plan for which manufacturing facility will take the wood and how it will get to market. We need to recognise the increased fire risks and diminishing water associated with climate change.“This kind of planning is nonexistent. The government needs to step in.”The Lean report will be at the heart of a fight to change the forestry position in Labor’s national platform. A draft national platform seen by Guardian Australia made no mention of reducing native forest logging and land-clearing – a long-time Lean goal.Labor is divided on the issue. The Western Australian and Victorian governments have promised to end native forest logging at the end of this year, and the federal ALP MP Josh Burns has urged action “to save our precious natural environment and native wildlife”.But the new New South Wales Labor government supports ongoing native forest logging while also promising to create a great koala national park, and the Tasmanian Labor opposition has accused the pro-forestry Liberal state government of not doing enough to support the industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The judgment said the minister had also accepted that climate change was affecting or would affect species, places and ecosystems protected under Australia’s national laws.Carmel Flint, the national coordinator at the Lock the Gate Alliance, said the judgment demonstrated Australia’s environmental laws were “fundamentally broken”.“The only genuine path forward now is to urgently legislate a climate trigger in national environment laws.”In a statement, Plibersek said the government would work through the implications of the judgment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A third (33%) have been seen more than once.“Photographs are a powerful tool for strengthening our understanding of whale movements and the threats they face – providing vital evidence for effective conservation,” said Dr Lauren Hartny-Mills, science and conservation manager for the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust.Scotland’s west coast seas are an important area for minke whales, which migrate to feed in their rich waters each summer.Thousands of photographs each year are shared with the trust by the public and wildlife-watching crews through a community sightings website and the free Whale Track app. Photographs are also collected by volunteers during the trust’s research expeditions on its research yacht Silurian.Researchers then use the images to look for specific markings or features to identify and catalogue individual whales, dolphins, porpoises and basking sharks seen in the region.The new catalogue reveals that Snowy the minke whale has visited the Hebridean waters over a 27-year period – the longest known history of sightings for this species in Europe.Record-breaking Knobble – named after a distinctive small bump on its dorsal fin – has become a local celebrity, starring in a children’s book, a Facebook page and in a song on YouTube. But Knobble’s sex, or where the mammal goes in winter, are still unknown.Photos can shed more light on the seasonal feeding habits of the whales – and the pressures they face in increasingly anthropogenic seas. The catalogue shows scars and injuries on 22% of the photographed minke whales, suggesting that individuals have at some point been entangled in marine litter and fishing gear, which can cause mobility problems, injury and death. The minke whales seen in Scottish waters are also believed to be the same population that is hunted in more northerly waters by commercial whalers from Iceland and Norway.The trust is asking for members of the public to submit their photos – whether recent or historic – to help its scientists learn more about the whales’ movements, health and the threats they face.Andy Tait, a wildlife guide for Sea Life Mull, has submitted thousands of images over the past 30 years.“I get great pleasure in sending in my photos to the trust, knowing every photograph I send makes a real difference to our understanding of amazing whales like Snowy and Knobble,” he said. “By using the new online catalogue, anyone can match their sightings with known individual whales. They might even discover a new whale that can be added to the catalogue, which is really exciting. This is citizen science in action, and the great thing is that anyone can get involved.”"

The average waiting time for an allotment was three years, while residents of Islington, north London, faced a 15-year wait.The local authority with the longest waiting list was Bristol, with 7,630 outstanding applications, followed by Sunderland, Portsmouth, Southampton, Edinburgh and Manchester.Greenpeace said the numbers of applicants demonstrated a desire among people to find new ways to tackle the intensifying cost of living, climate, nature and health crises.The tradition of allotment holding in Britain harks back to Anglo-Saxon times when swathes of land were commonly held for growing food, grazing livestock and collecting firewood, before the enclosure acts, over four centuries, where aristocrats fenced off public land for their own use.The modern system of allotments – named for small patches of land attached to tenant farmers cottages – emerged in the 19th century, and at the beginning of the 20th century the Allotment Act imposed a legal responsibility on local authorities to meet residents’ demand for allotments.A spokesperson for the National Allotment Society (NAS) said the steady increase in demand for allotments had been down to the cost of living crisis, the increased interest in “growing your own” during Covid, and better awareness of sustainable growing and healthy eating.The NAS campaigns to encourage housebuilders to incorporate allotments in new developments and also works with local authorities to ensure existing sites are properly managed. “Often usable plots stand vacant for periods of time,” the NAS said. “Vacancies due to issues with eviction, overgrown plots or lack of access are frustrating for those waiting years to get their hands on a plot.”Daniela Montalto, a Greenpeace UK forests campaigner, said: “Allotment waiting lists demonstrate a huge desire from people to be part of the solution to our broken food system but without access to land, the many benefits of community food growing to people, nature and the climate are being stifled.“The government must support councils to act as well as take seriously its own role in creating systemic and lasting change to the food system. Crucial steps include proper support for farmers to transition to climate-, people- and nature-friendly farming as well as measures to reduce our climate footprint abroad including a ban on imports of soya and other agricultural commodities that drive deforestation in places like Brazil.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "On Monday, in order to meet extra demand to power air conditioning, National Grid broke a 46-day run in which coal had not been used to generate electricity in Britain. But as the country swelters in the heat, commentators and green campaigners have asked why coal and not renewables were used to plug the gap.What actually happened?Late on Sunday night, after a day in which temperatures had topped 30C in some parts of the country, National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO) requested that the Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal plant be readied to burn coal to generate power. The ESO is tasked with balancing electricity supply and demand. Germany’s Uniper, which owns the Nottinghamshire power station, brought one unit into action on Monday morning, with a second following in the late afternoon to support the evening peak.Several factors had combined to put strain on the grid: the surge in demand for aircon; a fault on the 1,400-megawatt North Sea Link interconnector with Norway that meant the power the subsea cable was carrying to the UK was reduced by half; and planned maintenance at the Torness nuclear power station on the east coast of Scotland, which cut supplies.So the UK is still reliant on coal?No, the fossil fuel is a small and shrinking part of the UK’s energy system. However, fears over gas shortages in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine forced the UK and other nations to turn to it as a backup over the winter. In Britain, three coal plants, – Ratcliffe, EDF’s West Burton A and Drax in North Yorkshire – were paid to be kept on standby amid fears a cold snap and a lack of gas could cause blackouts.Energy mix: how is electricity generated in Great Britain?Read moreIn the event, they were largely unused. In February, the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, asked Drax and EDF to delay their stations’ planned decommissioning, but that suggestion was snubbed. Ratcliffe, meanwhile, is due to close in September 2024 – the date Britain has committed to end coal-fired generation. One unit at the site that had been due to close in 2022 will now close in September 2024, at the same time as the other three units.How much does switching on coal cost?Industry sources estimated that Uniper was paid about £500,000 for Monday’s actions. For context, some gas-fired power stations were paid as much as £12m on the tightest winter days.Keeping plants on standby under the winter contingency coal contracts cost about £400m. The cost of balancing the grid has been in the spotlight in recent months, amid calls for the profits of gas-fired power plants’ owners to be capped.Why aren’t we just turning to renewables?Britain’s wind sector has grown in recent years, and now typically accounts for about a quarter of electricity generation. But wind production slumped in the still conditions of the heatwave, forcing the ESO to seek other options. With the sun beaming down, solar picked up some of that slack – providing about 20% of power.As Britain has only a small amount of battery storage, there is little ability to hoard that renewable power for use when the wind drops and the sun doesn’t shine. An industry argument is raging over waiting times to connect up renewable projects, including battery storage, which would allow a swifter transition away from using fossil fuels to generate power.How prepared are we for a heating planet?The Climate Change Committee has said that the UK is “strikingly unprepared” for the impacts of the climate crisis. The independent body said a number of areas needed addressing, including heat-proofing homes, stemming leaks from water supply pipes and preparing for flash floods.For households, this could be mean costly retrofitting, but little official guidance has been issued. The introduction of a government “Future Homes Standard” is still two years away.‘A lot of challenges’: can housing industry build homes habitable in high temperatures?Read moreGuidance for local authorities issued earlier this year said: “Planning policy across the UK addresses the issues associated with climate change, but action has been delayed, inconsistent and de-prioritised for too long.”Greenpeace’s Ami McCarthy labelled the firing up of the coal units a “sign of failure”, adding: “If our homes were properly insulated, they’d keep us cool in the summer as well as warm in the winter, plus some heat pumps can cool as well as heat homes.”Worldwide, it is estimated that as many as a billion extra air conditioning units will be sold before the end of the decade, driven in part by demand in China and India where both incomes and temperatures are rising, creating a vicious cycle when much of the electricity used to power them is generated by fossil fuels."

This is almost four times the 6,213 in the equivalent period in 2021, and about two and a half times the 9,369 for June to August 2020.On the hottest day of the year, 19 July, more than 800 wildfires were recorded as temperatures rose above 40C in the UK for the first time, peaking at 40.3C at Coningsby in Lincolnshire. There were also many fires in mid-August, with 600 recorded each day from 11 to 14 August as temperatures reached the mid-30s.The hot weather in 2022 meant that it was likely to be the warmest year on record for the UK, the Met Office said on Wednesday. Meteorologists said this was likely to be a consequence of climate breakdown.London suffered a higher-than-average number of wildfires, with firefighters putting out 2,639 from June to August, nearly five times the number for summer 2021 and almost twice the figure for 2020.A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said: “Firefighters across London worked in very difficult conditions to protect Londoners during the intense heatwave this summer and their heroic actions meant no lives were lost.“The grass fires are an example of how we are increasingly being challenged by new extremes of weather as our climate changes. We must adapt to this change and are constantly looking at developing our equipment and procedures to meet all the new challenges that we face.”The north-east of England also faced a large number of wildfires. Cleveland Fire Brigade recorded 1,134 this summer, more than six times the number in 2021 and 2020.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "It is not the most attractive piece of land in Lancashire. But for Janine Bebbington and her friends, Moorside Fields was where all the important things in life happened.“It was our playground, it was where we went and climbed trees, used the running track from the nearby school, played rounders, explored, kissed people in the bushes, drank cider, did all the things that people get up to in green spaces.”Sitting in the middle of three estates in south Lancaster, the five fields have been enjoyed by locals for more than half a century. But plans to ensure that future generations will find delights there have been scuppered by the supreme court. On Wednesday, the court stripped Moorside Fields of its village green status, a ruling that campaigners predict will have major implications for the protection of open spaces across England and Wales.Under the Commons Act 2006, land that has been used for informal recreation for at least 20 years by local people without challenge or permission can be registered as a village green. Once registered, it is protected from development.Fears that the land might be built upon saw the Moorside Fields Community Group attempt to register the fields as a village green in 2008. The group won its case in the high court and the court of appeal. But the supreme court judgment, by a majority of three to two, has reversed the earlier decisions.“This is a deeply worrying decision as it puts at risk countless publicly owned green spaces which local people have long enjoyed, but which, unknown to them, are held for purposes which are incompatible with recreational use,” said Nicola Hodgson, case officer for the Open Spaces Society, which campaigns for the protection of town and village greens. “We urgently need a change in the law to ensure our precious green spaces are protected.”The county council, which owns the land, had objected on the grounds that the fields might be needed for the expansion of the local school. Some parents feared such a move would open up the school playing fields to the wider public, something that constituted a threat to pupil safety. Handing down its judgment in favour of the council, the court also quashed a separate attempt to grant three hectares of a wood in Surrey, owned by the NHS, village green status.Moorside Fields in winter. Photograph: Janine Bebbington“I think that this judgment totally redefines the way we understand land held in the public domain,” Bebbington said. “It affects every piece of land held by a statutory body, for example by the MoD, the NHS and local authorities.”She added: “I fear that Moorside Fields will now be developed or sold to fund new schools elsewhere. We are sad for the people of south Lancaster who in time will lose one of the last bits of open space available to them; and we are sad that England will be less green and pleasant as a result of this judgment.”A spokesman for Lancashire County Council said: “Our primary concern has always been to ensure that Moorside Primary School provides a secure environment where pupils can get the best education. This is a really important case not just for Lancashire County Council but for other local authorities and we are pleased that the court has recognised there is a need to protect this land for future generations.”The ruling is a major setback for open space campaigners who have enjoyed mixed fortunes down the years. A House of Lords decision in 1999, approving the right of the village of Sunningwell in Oxfordshire to register a strip of land as a village green, saw similar applications mushroom across the country.But the introduction of the Growth and Infrastructure Act in 2013 stipulated that land which had been subject to planning applications could not be granted village green status, staunching the flow of further registrations.“This ruling reflects what’s going on at a broader level in our society,” Bebbington said. “Every bit of green space has to be available for development because suddenly land is gold, especially to local authorities that don’t have any money. These spaces are community assets that help to keep us healthy and they are very important. They connect communities but they are taking them away from us.”"

The spell of relatively low spot prices would also need to be repeated for three more quarters to prompt a significant reduction in power prices.Still, the September quarter drop “points in the right direction”, Reeve said.The federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the government had capped coal and gas prices “to shield Australians from the worst of global energy price spikes”.“We understand that rising energy prices are one of the big challenges facing Australian families and Australian businesses this year,” Bowen said, noting the Coalition had vowed to repeal the price cap if in office.Dylan McConnell, an energy analyst at the University of New South Wales, said the $63/MWh average price in the September quarter masked a wide spread between states.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s either Boral’s shareholders, Boral’s customers or Boral’s workers.”A Boral spokesperson later qualified that the shutdowns were happening mostly at two big plants at Maldon and Berrima. These halted output “three to four times a month for short periods due to energy price peaks”."

        "text": "African leaders have warned that the world is facing the “biggest malaria emergency” of the past two decades.Heads of state and experts came together in a show of unity to call for urgent action on malaria at the UN general assembly on Friday, saying progress on eradicating the disease faced serious setbacks from mosquitoes’ growing resistance to insecticides, and the decreased effectiveness of antimalarial drugs and diagnostic tests.“We are at a critical juncture,” Guinea-Bissau’s president, Umaro Sissoco Embaló, said on the sidelines of the assembly. “If we don’t act swiftly … we will undoubtedly see malaria upsurges and epidemics.”The number of people living with malaria in Africa has decreased steadily for nearly two decades, but funding for the disease plateaued in 2015 amid donor fatigue and the later redirection of funding to other health priorities, such as Covid-19.“Now is the time to fully finance the malaria fight to ensure that we eliminate the disease once and for all,” said Embaló.Progress on malaria had been reversed in at least 13 countries and had stalled in others, the World Health Organization said last month. Leaders have warned that funding shortfalls were placing lifesaving malaria treatments out of reach of many people at risk, threatening plans to eradicate the disease by 2030.Julio Rakotonirina, the director of health and humanitarian affairs at the African Union Commission, said: “We need to ensure that we sustain our political commitment and continue to translate these commitments into concrete action. With most AU member states off-track to achieve the goal of eliminating malaria by 2030, much still needs to be done.”Africa bears the highest burden of malaria cases globally, and accounts for 96% of deaths from the disease, according to 2021 data. Nearly 80% of those deaths are in children under the age of five.As attention paid to the disease has waned, threats such as the climate crisis have added to the problem, experts say. Higher temperatures and rainfall create perfect breeding conditions for mosquitoes.The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as flooding and cyclones, across the continent in recent years further raises the likelihood of mosquito-borne diseases.The Kemri Wellcome Trust in Kilifi led a recent malaria vaccine trial in Kenya that had promising results and raised new hope in the fight against malaria. Photograph: Luis Tato/GuardianMozambique, for instance, witnessed spikes in malaria after Cyclone Freddy earlier this year, and such disasters make it harder for medication and services to reach affected areas.“It’s a vicious cycle that we have to overcome,” said Dr Michael Adekunle Charles, the head of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, a global platform for coordinated action against the disease.“If we don’t continue making the connection [on climate-related risks to health], then we are going to lose a lot of ground in the fight against malaria.”Malaria vaccines such as RTS,S/AS01 are being gradually rolled out across the continent. Experts have warned that while the vaccines were a significant breakthrough, they were not a “silver bullet” that would end malaria and there should be no letup in other measures to curb the disease.Treated bednets, for instance, have been the most effective malaria prevention strategy since their introduction in the early 90s, preventing about 68% of cases in sub-Saharan Africa. However, their effectiveness can wane over time due to growing mosquito resistance.“The mosquito is always evolving, so we need to get ahead of it. If we don’t, it will outsmart us,” said Charles.The group of leaders at the UN called for the establishment of national malaria councils to keep the disease on countries’ development priorities, and for extra funding from the World Bank to tackle malaria."

        "text": "Housebuilders who “just shove trees in the ground” to meet planting targets will be made to ensure they survive by watering them properly, as part of plans being considered by ministers.Under the government’s legally binding environment improvement plan targets, which replace EU nature rules, the aim is to increase England’s woodland cover from 10% to 16.5% by 2050. The government has therefore set tree planting targets and asked private businesses to contribute in return for funding or as part of a biodiversity net gain plan.However, woodland experts have warned that many trees are dying soon after being planted, as inappropriate species are chosen or they are placed too close together, or they are abandoned and not watered properly. They have asked the government to set tree survival targets, as it is not currently monitored.The environment minister Rebecca Pow, who in her new role after the government reshuffle is responsible for climate resilience and nature, said she was aware of these concerns and was aiming to tackle the short lifespan of too many trees that are planted to meet government targets.Taking aim at housing developers, she said: “We have examples of it … where hundreds of trees have been planted too close together, in the wrong soil type, and they’ve just died. We’ve seen it from sometimes big housing developers who’ve got to tick the box of planting X amount of trees but if you don’t put the right care in for the tree, there’s no way it’s going to survive.”Pow said aftercare for trees, including watering and protection from pests, must be included in any scheme: “So that means also making sure the soil is suitable when you put the tree in, potentially having a system where we make sure that it can be watered in its first years but also protection from pests as well. This is absolutely critical. It can’t be just a matter of shoving trees in the ground.”Pow has announced £16m of funding to Forest Research, the research agency of the Forestry Commission, to contribute to its work on helping trees survive the effects of climate breakdown, which include new pests that thrive in a warmer climate, and increasing droughts.She said: “The evidence and the science is changing all the time, which is why research centres like this are so important because it will then inform what we should do.”At the research centre, they are testing different tree species in different soils as well as finding new ways to eliminate pests, which can destroy whole woodlands.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

So there’s a lot of research now going on at this centre about the species that are the most climate-resilient.”She said she hoped the research could alleviate some of the concerns nature experts have, including that having blanket tree planting targets and being paid a certain amount of money for each tree causes monocultures to be created, which may not be the best for biodiversity. The aim is to give species suggestions to those planting trees depending on the climate of where they are in the country, as well as their soil types."

        "text": "Thérèse Coffey has been “complacent” in dealing with water companies, risking water shortages as well as extreme environmental consequences, a House of Lords committee has said.In a letter to the environment secretary, the peers criticised her department’s “dismissive brevity and complacent tone” in response to their report published earlier this year, which found water companies had been too focused on maximising financial returns at the expense of the environment.During an inquiry into Ofwat, the water regulator, the House of Lords industry and regulators’ committee found a “lack of leadership and deep-rooted complacency” in the government, which was leading to failure by water companies to protect supply and the environment.The letter sent to Coffey said: “We object to the apparent insinuation that our conclusions and recommendations were outside the scope of our inquiry, which appears to be an attempt to avoid parliamentary scrutiny.”The committee also said in the letter that underinvestment in water infrastructure would have serious long-term consequences for the environment and the security of water supplies, risking the possibility of future water shortages.Though the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) published its plan for water earlier this year, the committee found it lacking and said it would not solve the problems plaguing the environment and consumers.The inquiry indicated that water bills needed to rise to tackle underinvestment, which has caused leaky pipes and sewage spills, but recommended that a single social tariff for those who would struggle to pay bills was implemented so people did not fall into debt.In the letter, the peers wrote: “The plan for water includes the acceleration of £1.6bn of new water company infrastructure but provides little information on how the government intends to tackle the trade-off between infrastructure investment and customer bills, instead expressing its hope to deliver ‘significant new investment’ without ‘disproportionately large increases to customer bills’.” The peers added that they were disappointed the government had dismissed the idea of a single social tariff.Noting that “under present plans, the UK will not have built a single new major reservoir between 1991 and 2029”, the committee expressed alarm that the government did not seem to be planning to secure the water supply sufficiently to avoid shortages. It said: “Although the plan for water sets out proposals for reducing water demand, we share concerns that these policies are likely to be insufficient to meet the government’s targets.”Clive Hollick, the chair of the industry and regulators’ committee, said: “While the government has begun to set out its vision for the sector, our cross-party committee has concluded unanimously that there is insufficient policy or drive to meet the government’s targets. Sadly, the only thing that is becoming clear in the murky, polluted waters of the sewage crisis is a lack of leadership and deep-rooted complacency.“The government must therefore provide firmer policy detail and greater guidance to regulators, who cannot be left to resolve these huge challenges by themselves. In particular, the government must give clear guidance on the trade-off between much-needed investment and the level of customer bills. We look forward to the response from the secretary of state, setting out how she intends to do this.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "As migrant arrivals go, the appearance of Thor the Walrus in British waters last week was encouraging. Thousands flocked to greet the huge mammal as he meandered up England’s east coast after his arrival in Hampshire in December.Subsequent stopovers included Scarborough, where the local council cancelled New Year’s Eve celebrations so they did not frighten Thor, who gratefully responded by masturbating. Then he moved on to Blyth, in Northumberland, before heading home to the Arctic.Walruses are rare visitors to Britain and the public’s positive reaction to his arrival is encouraging. Wildlife has never been more under threat and the fact so many people gathered to see Thor has to be treated as good news.As to the reason for his visit, most experts conclude it was caused by climate change, triggered by rising fossil fuel emissions, which is heating the planet and reducing the sea ice cover upon which walruses rest, hunt and digest their food. As Molly Gray, of British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDLMR) put it: “It’s not very normal to see walruses down here so we imagine it is because of climate change.”This interpretation is not shared by everyone, however. Indeed, it was flatly rejected by climate change sceptic Matt Ridley in the Times. Everything is fine and dandy in the Arctic, he insisted. Sea ice levels are not badly affected and, far from being a threatened species, walrus numbers are rising, along with those of polar bears. Why don’t you report the good news about the environment? he demanded.Needless to say, Ridley’s assertion is hotly disputed. Yes, numbers of walruses have been recovering slowly since 1952 – when Norway made it illegal to hunt them. That does not mean they are thriving in a warming climate, says Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change. “In fact, in 2016, the walrus was classified as vulnerable on the IUCN red list of threatened species.”Ridley’s claims that the reduction in the Arctic sea ice has not been significant is not supported by data, which shows a 700,000 sq kilometres reduction over 20 years.Thor’s visit to Britain clearly highlights a shift in the climate wars. Deniers cannot now claim – without looking idiotic – that the world is not heating. It clearly is. Instead, they argue there may be some warming but it is having little impact. The world, like the walrus, is doing fine.This claim is simply not true. The planet is changing and all its inhabitants are in danger, as David Attenborough said. “The lives of walruses, like those of polar bears and seals, are changing. All are living at the frontier of climate change and all are suffering as a result.”● Robin McKie is the Observer’s Science Editor\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The approved textbooks are published by Savvas Learning Company, McGraw Hill, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Accelerate Learning and Summit K-12.Backlash after Fox Sports reporter admits making up coaches’ quotesRead moreThe rejected textbooks included climate-crisis policy solutions, and conservative board members criticized them for being too negative about fossil fuels – a major industry in the state. Texas leads the nation in the production of crude oil and natural gas.Although Texas adopted standards in 2021 that requires eighth-graders be taught the basics about climate change, some argue that measure does not go far enough.Aaron Kinsey, a Republican board member and executive of an oilfield services company in west Texas, criticized photos in some textbooks as unduly besmirching the oil and gas industry during a discussion of the materials this week.“The selection of certain images can make things appear worse than they are, and I believe there was bias,” Kinsey said, according to Hearst Newspapers.“You want to see children smiling in oilfields?” said Democratic board member Aicha Davis. “I don’t know what you want.”Texas’s 1,000-plus school districts are not required to use board-approved textbooks. But the board’s decision wields influence.Some in powerful positions have tried to sway the board to reject the textbooks. On 1 November, the Texas railroad commissioner, Wayne Christian – who oversees the state’s oil and gas industry – sent a letter to the education board’s chairman, Kevin Ellis, relaying “concerns for potential textbooks that could promote a radical environmentalist agenda”.Also contested was the inclusion of lessons on evolution – the theory addressing the origins of human existence which the scientific community supports and religious groups reject.The decision comes despite pleas from the National Science Teaching Association to not “allow misguided objections to evolution and climate change” to affect the adoption of new textbooks.The deputy director of the National Center on Science Education, Glenn Branch, said: “Members of the board are clearly motivated to take some of these textbooks off of the approved list because of their personal and ideological beliefs regarding evolution and climate change.”Texas is one of six states that has not adopted the Next Generation Science Standards in its K-12 science curriculum. The standards underscore that climate change is a real threat caused by humans and can be mitigated by a reduction in greenhouse gases.Texas has seen some of the most extreme effects of the worsening climate crisis in recent years. According to the Texas state climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon, the summer of 2023 was the second hottest on record, after 2011.In 2021, Texas experienced an unprecedented winter storm that blanketed much of the state in snow, left millions without power after the electrical grid failed, and resulted in deaths. Houston also bore the wrath of 2017’s Hurricane Harvey, a devastating category 4 hurricane that destroyed homes and buildings while leading to the deaths of more than 100 people in Texas.The state ranks 41st out of 50 in the US for education.The Associated Press contributed reporting"

The sparrow confesses right away, and nobody minds. The fly – “I, said the fly, with my little eye, I saw him die” – is a witness of whom no questions are asked. Everyone seems eager for the burial, eager to help, insincere in their mourning, “a-sighing and sobbing”.Everything is small. The fish catching blood in his “little dish”, the rook playing parson with his “little book”. The death of a little bird, and a funeral for a bird the size, and almost the shape, of an orange, and weighing no more than an orange segment.A nautilus: a mass extinction event survivor in a spiral shell which reflects galaxies | Helen SullivanRead moreLong ago the feathers on the robin’s chest were called “red” because there was no word for the colour “orange”. In old English for 1,000 years there was only the word “geoluhread” or yellow-red, according to David Scott Kastan and Stephen Farthing, two academics who wrote a book on the history of colours. The word orange became a colour name when the fruit was introduced to Europe in the 16th century. For Chaucer a fox’s colour was “betwixe yelow and reed.” For Shakespeare a beard was “orange-tawny”.To Mark Ford, the robin’s eye was “gimlet”: “why / did he not spy / with his gimlet eye, the impending / peril”. The robin can detect the Earth’s magnetic field. Inside her small dark eye, a quantum entanglement (according to one study): electrons not touching, but affecting each other.Wired explains it like this:\nOne of the electrons migrates a few nanometers away, where it feels a slightly different magnetic field than its partner. Depending on how the magnetic field alters the electron’s spin, different chemical reactions are produced. In theory, the products of many such reactions across a bird’s eye could create a picture of Earth’s magnetic field as a varying pattern of light and dark.\nRobins use the pictures in their eyes to migrate between Africa and Europe. They use their sight to follow you around the garden in winter, hoping to catch a worm dug up from the hard ground. You are tired; you hang your jacket up and go inside for breakfast.

It was announced late on Thursday.The mine, to be developed by Bowen Coking Coal, is planned for 28km east of Moranbah, next to five other coalmines, and expected to produce about 500,000 tonnes of metallurgical coal a year for five years. Metallurgical coal, also known as coking coal, is used in steelmaking.Dozens of climate activists arrested after shovelling coal from train bound for NewcastleRead more“The Albanese government has to make decisions in accordance with the facts and the national environment law – that’s what happens on every project, and that’s what’s happened here,” a spokesperson for Plibersek said.“Since the election we’ve doubled renewable energy approvals to a record high. The government will continue to consider each project on a case-by-case basis, under the law.”The government said no submissions had been received about the project during the public consultation period, including from environment groups.But climate campaigners had made public statements calling on Plibersek to reject the mine in line with scientific advice that no new fossil fuel developments should go ahead if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C.“Scientists, energy and climate experts have said that the climate cannot afford new coalmines, and they’ve said it so many times I’ve lost count,” said Rod Campbell, research director at the Australia Institute.“The fact that this is a small coking coalmine is beside the point – fossil carbon needs to stay in the ground. We’ve already got more than enough coalmines approved to cook the planet, including coking coalmines that could run into next century.“This approval comes late in the evening in budget week, the perfect time for controversial news.”The announcement comes a week after Plibersek cancelled two coal projects whose applications had lapsed.Dr Coral Rowston, the director of EnvA (Environmental Advocacy) CQ, a grassroots group in central Queensland, said the project would affect habitat for the vulnerable ornamental snake.“The other key issue for us is the mine will also leave a legacy for our water quality in central Queensland due to the release of affected water from sediment dams into the Isaac River which feeds into the Great Barrier Reef.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Thursday’s decision leaves 11 still to be reconsidered by Plibersek.Environmental Justice Australia senior lawyer Retta Berryman said: “Our client is carefully considering all legal options in light of today’s decision – including one or more federal court challenges.” This article was amended on 12 May 2023 to remove a statement from Coral Rowston referring to koala and greater glider habitat. The Isaac River mine that has been approved would not affect those areas."

Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesFlooding in August from Tropical Storm Hilary closed the park for months. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesThe floodwaters have transformed the famous Badwater Basin salt flats, which are now covered in shimmering water believed to be about 2ft deep. “That’s what it was in 2005, the last time there was a significant lake there,” park ranger Matthew Lamar, told the Los Angeles Times.‘Here for the heat’: Death Valley sizzles, but the tourism doesn’t stopRead moreWhile the park is experiencing its wettest moment in close to two decades, the waters won’t last long. “It depends in part on temperatures,” Lamar added, but with the landscape’s high evaporation rate, there may be just weeks before they recede.The basin, which sprawls across close to 200 sq miles and typically features striking salt formations, once housed an ancient lake that evaporated tens of thousands of years ago. At 282ft below sea level, it’s the lowest point in North America.This year marked the second consecutive year in which the park was forced to close due to a record-breaking rain event, and crews are still working to repair damage left in 2022. The fierce downpour this past summer added to the destruction as roads were washed away and infrastructure was doused in mud.Badwater Basin is located 282ft below sea level, the lowest elevation in North America. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesDeath Valley, considered the hottest place in the world and the driest on the continent, is accustomed to extremes. This summer, temperatures in the park regularly topped 120F, making it not only one of the wettest but the hottest years yet.Deep mud cracks, where water carved through the sediment and evaporated, tell the stories of age-old storms and add to the desert ambience that make these lands so special. This flood, too, left its mark on the human-made structures and natural ones alike.“Every so often, there are events that are large enough to break weather records and cause significant damage to historic locations and park infrastructure,” the National Park Service wrote on the park’s website. “The natural forces that formed this landscape are still at play.”"

        "text": "A programme to reintroduce cheetahs in India after 75 years has been called into question after three of the animals died in recent weeks and concerns were raised that their new habitat was unsuitable.Since October, 20 cheetahs – which became extinct in the country in 1952 – have been brought over from South Africa and Namibia as part of a much-lauded government programme to house them in Kuno national park, Madhya Pradesh state.The first eight cheetahs arrived amid much fanfare, with the prime minister, Narendra Modi, releasing them into a small fenced enclosure on his 72nd birthday. Another 12 African cheetahs have since been flown over and the plan is to release a total of 50 over the next five to 10 years.However, the programme was criticised by many wildlife and conservation experts, who accused the Modi government of a rushed “publicity stunt” and alleged that Kuno national park was an unsuitable habitat for so many cheetahs, which usually require vast habitats of thousands of square miles to roam. In Kuno their terrain will be less than 500 square miles.The concerns have been heightened in recent weeks after the deaths of three of the cheetahs still being held in captivity in the fenced enclosure inside Kuno, months after arriving in India. Sasha, a male, died from a pre-existing medical condition in March, another died in April and a female, Daksha, died this month in a violent mating after she was put in an enclosure with two other males.In a supreme court hearing last week, the judges claimed Kuno national park was an unfit home for dozens of African cheetahs. “It appears that Kuno is not sufficient for so many cheetahs. There is too much concentration of cheetahs in one place,” said the bench of judges.They called on the government to “rise above politics” and consider homing some of the cheetahs in other states such as Rajasthan, where the opposition party rules at the state level. “They need to be protected, they need to be given suitable habitat. Why don’t you explore for more suitable habitat than Kuno?” said the bench.Scientists in India leading the reintroduction efforts have said deaths are to be expected and are not symptomatic of a failure of the project. They said four cheetah cubs had also been born since they were brought to India.But for wildlife experts critical of the reintroduction experiment, the supreme court’s acknowledgment that Kuno is not suitable has come too late. There is also concern that India lacks the expertise to properly handle the cheetahs, especially as they remained in captivity for so long. So far only three of the big cats have been released into the park and 17 remain in human captivity in the enclosure.Ravi Chellam, coordinator of Biodiversity Collaborative, called the programme “a vanity project” and said it was at best creating “a glorified safari park” that had little to do with conservation and could have a negative effect on the health of the animals and on wider conservation efforts in India.“The deaths have brought attention to much more fundamental problems,” he said. “Why are the cheetahs being held in captivity for so long? The people who wrote the action plan are now saying that Kuno is inadequate. Why have they brought over 20 cheetahs from Africa if only eight to 10 can be accommodated in the park? What are we trying to achieve here?”In response to the supreme court, the government representative said a taskforce was investigating the deaths and that other locations were being investigated to home some of the cheetahs."

        "text": "A new upstart is entering the big-budget world of wildlife film-making. After the BBC scrapped Autumnwatch, Chris Packham is launching his own nature show, which will be broadcast for two weeks on YouTube.In stark contrast to the multimillion-pound Planet Earth III, which premiered on Sunday night with 97-year-old Sir David Attenborough narrating, 8 Out of 10 Bats, which begins on Monday evening, is an “anarchic” DIY operation that cost just £50,000 and features a diverse roster of teenage and 20-something naturalist presenters.“It’s like I’ve put a band together,” said Packham. “I feel like Malcolm McLaren and I’m trying to steer the Sex Pistols of wildlife TV.”Packham and his stepdaughter Megan McCubbin, the Springwatch presenter and zoologist, will host the live show alongside new presenters including Indy Greene, 18, a conservationist; Christina Sinclair, a Scottish marine biologist; George Hassall, a wildlife gardener and student; and Kwesia, a wildlife vlogger also known as City Girl in Nature.The series will showcase wildlife wonders found in Britain, combining short films by leading wildlife camerapeople with live segments, “hilarious props”, audience participation – and the promise of controversy.Springwatch and Winterwatch are closely governed by the BBC’s impartiality rules, but Packham, an increasingly outspoken environmental campaigner, is free to be as hard-hitting as he wants on his online show.8 Out of 10 Bats will cover environmental controversies including sewage pollution in rivers, protests against the Rosebank oil and gas field and a campaign against the destruction caused by a busway in Cambridgeshire.Packham said: “Megs and I thought, let’s do everything the BBC can’t do, like get 12-year-olds talking about their bird feeder, make sure we do diversity properly, have a 50/50 split of male/female contributors and give all these young film-makers a foundation to show their wares.“We can be a bit more controversial, we can do a bit more campaigning, and cover local campaigns where people are struggling.”The show, funded entirely by Packham with the promise of financial assistance from an environmentalist friend, will broadcast from the Dundreggan Rewilding Centre near Loch Ness in the Highlands for its first week, before moving to the British Wildlife Centre in Surrey for its second.The small team making 8 Out of 10 Bats are all paid equally except Packham, who is unpaid. Packham and McCubbin started an online show, the Self-Isolating Bird Club, during the first Covid lockdown, when it gathered a cult following.Packham said: “My main thrust is making sure all these youngsters have got some space and airtime. A young bloke called Rufus made a film about wall lizards, edited it on his phone and sent it to us. It’s just brilliant. Another film-maker made a minute-long film about what happens to an apple when it falls off a tree. It’s absolutely fantastic and beautifully shot.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I love talking about goshawks, so I’ll be talking about goshawks. It’s lovely to have something that doesn’t feel too formal and you can have fun with it. It’s a brilliant, brilliant group of people.”Sinclair, 29, a marine biologist and wildlife film producer, said she understood why the BBC had its impartiality rules but she was looking forward to publicising crucial environmental campaigns as well as wildlife found in Scotland.“I wouldn’t use the word ‘radical’ but it is an opportunity to highlight our personal feelings in the areas we are knowledgable about. I can use my knowledge of marine biology and spotlight some important campaigns,” she said.“There is a green wave. At the same time that young people are becoming disengaged from nature, there is growing awareness that we have to move towards a more sustainable world. We have to help that new generation move into that and give them a bit of hope.”"

Research shows that more affluent people, attracted by the aesthetic appeal of a fire, are driving that increase.However, a growing body of evidence highlights the environmental and health damage caused, with scientists saying that people who burn wood are subjecting themselves – and their neighbourhoods – to high levels of the most dangerous small particulate pollution, PM2.5, which can work its way deep into the body, causing a range of severe health issues including heart disease, strokes, asthma and cancer.Last year, a study from Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, found that even “eco design” wood burning stoves produced 450 times more toxic air pollution than gas central heating, while older stoves, now banned from sale, produced 3,700 times more.Another study found that wood burning in homes produced more small particle pollution than all road traffic in the UK.The latest research, carried by Global Action Plan for Impact on Urban Health, found that the perception among the public was often that wood burners at least offered a cheaper source of energy.However, that was only true when wood was sourced for free, the study found. Experts say scrap wood and wood that has not been properly dried or seasoned is even more toxic and extremely harmful to the health of those who are burning it, as well as to their neighbours.Lucy Anderson, the head of research at Global Action Plan, said: “Pressures on household finances may be tempting more people towards burning wood because they believe it’s cheaper. But our new research demonstrates that wood burning is almost always more expensive than other forms of heating in the UK.”The study found that when a household used a newly installed, Defra-approved wood burner for 20% of its heat, the yearly cost, including installation, was £2,028-£2,204 – 24% more than running a typical gas boiler. The cost increased to almost 50% more expensive where a household used newly installed wood burners for 80% of its heat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In all scenarios, wood burners were more expensive than air source heat pumps.With winter approaching, a range of organisations including Global Action Plan, Impact on Urban Health and Mums for Lungs are calling for greater awareness of the economic, environmental and health costs of wood burning.Jemima Hartshorn, the founder and director of Mums for Lungs, said: “Every autumn and winter, people in towns and cities are exposed to extreme levels of toxic fumes from wood burning.” She said children were often the worst hit. “It’s vital people are aware of the strong connection between burning wood and the air pollution it causes, which has lasting, damaging effects on people’s lives.”Andy Hill, the chair of the Stove Industry Alliance, said: “Keeping warm is fundamental to human health and wellbeing. When bought in bulk, choosing wood fuel means that consumers have a fixed fuel cost for the duration of the heating season. A modern stove, as well as being highly efficient and low-emission, offers a reliable and completely grid-independent way of heating our homes, something an air source heat pump and many gas boilers simply cannot do. At a time when energy security has never been more important, the peace of mind this gives is invaluable.”"

The regulator added that the opening of the new investigation did not imply it had found a breach of its rules, but it would stand ready to act if appropriate.Drax has received billions in renewable energy subsidies for its biomass electricity while facing growing criticism over its “carbon neutral” claims and deepening scepticism over the sustainability of burning imported wood to generate electricity.A spokesperson for Drax said it was confident its biomass was compliant with the criteria of the renewable subsidy scheme.“Last year Drax appointed a third party to independently verify the accuracy of its biomass sustainability and profiling data as part of an ongoing process,” the company said in a statement. “Like all energy generators, Drax receives regular requests from Ofgem and continues to cooperate fully throughout this process.”The Guardian revealed last year that Kwasi Kwarteng, the business and energy secretary at the time, told a private meeting of MPs that Drax importing wood to burn in its power station was “not sustainable” and “doesn’t make any sense”. In a recording of the meeting, Kwarteng also admitted: “We haven’t actually questioned some of the [sustainability] premises of it.”The political scepticism followed a decision to oust Drax from an investment index of clean energy companies in 2021 as doubts over the sustainability of its plant mounted within the financial sector.The company has consistently claimed that it uses wood from forests that are sustainably managed, but experts believe there are poor practices regarding the sources of wood and forest management in some parts of the timber industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the company told investors this year it would pause its plans to invest in the carbon-capture project while it waited for more details from the government on a possible subsidy."

If I could, I would apologise in person to those caught up in the disruption.”‘We’ll be hated, but it will stir things up’: Insulate Britain on what happened next – and being right all along Read moreHowever, she added: “The prosecution did not bring to court any members of the public supposedly so affected by the protest. The action wasn’t selfish. We planned the action carefully.”Lancaster said she felt she had acted with “care”, and that if she could face drivers disrupted by their protest, she would apologise to each for the delays they faced.In comments that led the judge to send jurors out of the court, she added: “I do not apologise for the actions I took. I feel I acted with care when our politicians do not care, letting thousands die each winter from the cold, failing to reduce carbon emissions that are destroying our world, and using our legal system to criminalise and gag those who raise the alarm.”After the jurors returned to court, Reid told them: “She [Lancaster] knew she wasn’t entitled to say what she said at the end of her address.“She wants the trial to deal with her concerns with respect to climate change. That is not what this trial is about.“You must ignore what she said with respect to the government and climate change. You must not hold against her any potential perception that she is trying to manipulate you to go against your oath of affirmation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I am not going to take any action in relation to what is a clear contempt.”In his closing speech, Till, who is a professor of history at the University of Sussex, accepted that they had blocked the road, but questioned whether it amounted to a public nuisance.“We knew we were going to cause disruption,” he said. He then said to the jury: “We carried out the act for the people caught up in it, for their children and grandchildren, and for your children and grandchildren.”Reid declined to discharge the jury after Till’s words, but asked them to disregard elements of Till’s closing address.All four will be sentenced on 30 June."

        "text": "In the soft, rolling hills of the Derbyshire dales the grass is clipped to just a few centimetres by gently bleating sheep. For game artist and designer Harry Nesbitt who grew up here, this countryside is in his blood. “There’s something there deep in my subconscious,” he says. “I always want to tell stories or depict worlds that are close to my heart.”Nesbitt’s fondness for this terrain is visible the very first time you look at Summerhill, his forthcoming puzzle-adventure game that tasks the player with herding sheep through a bucolic landscape. You’re accompanied by a dog who provides key assistance; you’ll come across intriguing ruined structures, the remains of an ancient civilisation whose culture was centred on shepherding, through which you must guide your growing flock. Nesbitt says these ruins are designed in order to “contain, funnel, or sort” sheep in certain ways, causing the player to “rationalise” and “reconfigure” the space in order to progress.“The analogy we give is the riddle of the man who is trying to cross a river on a boat who’s got a fox, chicken, and some grain,” says Nesbitt. “You want to keep all three things safe but you can’t carry all three at the same time. So there’s a bit of logical problem solving. I need to get from A to B, and I want to get my sheep from A to B, but we can’t all do it the same way.”Beyond the satisfaction of solving such spatial head-scratchers, Nesbitt aims to evoke gentle mystery, and perhaps even a little awe, through such environments, referencing the approach taken by Fumito Ueda on Shadow of the Colossus and The Last Guardian. “They have such a distinct vibe and a very deliberate kind of world-building,” he says. “You can’t fully comprehend the space that you’re in or what its purpose is. Why is it uninhabited now, and what has taken place here through the aeons?”For all the pensive stillness of Ueda’s games, they’re driven by the forceful, unpredictable, movement of the gigantic beasts that roam their lands. Summerhill employs a similar juxtaposition albeit on a more modest scale – set against the picturesque scenery, your woolly friends swell, contract, congregate, and dissipate as one droving motion, albeit with more than a few exuding a wily mind of their own.For the sheep’s group behaviour, Nesbitt and his team sought inspiration in the aerial drone footage of shepherding – “hypnotic and mesmerising,” he says. After the best part of five years prototyping the game in the downtime during other projects, the interactive outcome is a “fun, kinaesthetic, toy-like mechanic … Something that’s very expressive, very fluid, something you can just play with and watch the patterns emerge.”Nesbitt draws a direct line between Summerhill and his two previous titles: the hugely successful Alto’s Adventure and Alto’s Odyssey. Beyond the beautifully illustrative graphics, evocative colour palette, and reflective mood, he sees each of these titles as fundamentally about the “joy of movement, a kind of expressive motion”.Specific to Summerhill, though, is the idea of connection, both to custom and land. “Shepherding goes back thousands and thousands of years and you find it in every culture, in any country on every continent,” he says. Summerhill, then, is about connecting players to the oldest of folk traditions while evoking the weighty relationships that underpin it. “We want to endear people to the dog and endear people to the sheep so they can feel a genuine sense of responsibility – the duty bestowed upon you,” he says. “We, as developers, can gently tug on the strings of those feelings.”\nSummerhill will be out on PC and unannounced platforms; release date TBA\n"

Plastic recycling workers have increased rates of cardiovascular disease, toxic metal poisoning, neuropathy, and lung cancer.”Meanwhile, residents of communities adjacent to plastic production and waste disposal sites experience increased risks of premature birth, low birth weight, asthma, childhood leukaemia, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. The report referred to evidence that infants in the womb and young children were at particularly high risk.The article recommends a global plastics treaty to control the manufacture and use of plastics, and to reduce the disproportionate health and environmental impacts of plastics on coastal and ocean-dependent communities and those working in high-risk industries. The authors wrote that any treaty should be in accord with the mandate set in March 2022 at the UN Environment Assembly.Frank Seebacher, a professor in biology at the University of Sydney’s school of life and environmental sciences, agreed that a binding treaty was needed.“Plastics are on par with climate change in their harmful effects globally, and drive climate change with their need for fossil fuels,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This new paper looks like it is making a very valuable contribution by synthesising the available literatures into a set of concrete recommendations.”Group leader of the inflammation biology group at the QIMR Berghofer in Brisbane, Prof Andreas Suhrbier, said nearly all humans now consumed “a fair amount of plastic” and it was crucial that more research funding be dedicated to examining its impact.“Sadly, the amount of good medical research in this space is very limited. What are the direct detrimental effects on human health of such plastic consumption? What diseases are exacerbated by such plastic consumption? Who in our population would be most vulnerable?“Questions regarding the health impacts of microplastic consumption are hard to answer without dedicated research funding and some well-constituted studies that establish a causal relationship between microplastic consumption and a disease or disorder.” This article was amended on 3 April 2023 to remove a quote from Andreas Suhrbier that said it was estimated humans consumed a credit card’s worth of plastic a week.

        "text": "The UK’s most senior climate adviser has strongly endorsed Labour’s vow to halt new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea, and slammed the government for failing to show leadership on the issue.John Gummer, who as Lord Deben chairs the statutory committee on climate change, told the Guardian he approved of Labour’s commitment. “I welcome this policy, I am absolutely in favour and it is the right thing to do,” he said.“I’m sorry this is not a common view to all parties,” he added.Gummer, a former Conservative environment secretary in the 1990s, blasted ministers who have attacked Labour’s proposals. He pointed out that the government’s support for new oil and gas exploration ran counter to its stance at international climate negotiations, now taking place in Bonn.“I don’t understand how the government can ask other people not to produce more oil [while supporting new oil and gas licences in the North Sea]. That’s exactly what they are doing now – asking other people not to do what they’re doing,” he said.Labour has come under fire over its stance on the North Sea, from the government as well as its own supporters. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, used social media to lambast Keir Starmer, charging him with committing to higher energy bills.The GMB union also attacked Starmer after he last week reaffirmed a commitment made earlier this year to halt the drilling of new oil and gas wells in the North Sea. Gary Smith, leader of the GMB Union, claimed it was “naive” and would cost jobs.But Starmer has strongly defended his decision, which along with commitments to green jobs, new nuclear power and renewable energy will form the centrepiece of a policy statement to be made in Scotland later this month.Gummer told the Guardian that leaders across the political spectrum should follow Labour’s lead. “This should be the common view of all parties,” he said.He said it was “nonsense” to claim that new oil and gas fields would reduce energy bills. “These are new oilfields that will not come on stream for another 10 or 20 years. And when they do, the oil and gas will be sold to the highest bidder. So it will not reduce prices in the UK. The only way you could make them reduce bills here would be to nationalise them.”He said fears over jobs at risk in the North Sea were also unfounded. He said the UK should continue to produce gas from existing fields in the short term, but future jobs would be in green industries.“I’m in favour of producing more gas now, we need it owing to what Putin has done, but we are not talking about that – we are talking about new oilfields that would not come on stream for many years,” he said.“There are vast numbers of jobs to be had in offshore and onshore wind, in solar PV, which are all much cheaper than using oil. The jobs are all there in green industries – these are new jobs, the oil jobs are old jobs. Trade unions should be supporting new job creation.”Gummer said he also favoured building new nuclear power stations, which Starmer has also pledged to support.Before his ennoblement as Lord Deben, Gummer was a long-serving Conservative MP and former environment secretary and minister, under Margaret Thatcher and John Major. He is due to leave his CCC post later this month, and a successor has not yet been named.International negotiations are taking place in Bonn this week and next over how to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. But the government would not confirm to the Guardian whether any ministers will attend.Gummer said a halt to new oil and gas exploration was essential to keep the global climate livable. “Climate change will mean we will not be able to live as we do now, in the very near future. It’s urgent, it has to be dealt with, and we cannot ignore it,” he said.A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “In line with our net zero 2050 commitment, we will not shy away from awarding new licences where they are justified, and where they can benefit Britain. While our plans to power up Britain include significant investment in new renewable and nuclear projects, the transition to non-fossil forms of energy cannot happen overnight and even when we’re net zero, we will still need some oil and gas, as recognised by the independent CCC.”"

        "text": "My dad lives on a boat. Despite the earrings, tattoos, missing teeth and bare feet, he is not a pirate – just a man with an expensive divorce and a public sector job, living in one of the most unaffordable cities in the UK.This month, his mooring in Oxford was hit by the kind of flood described as “once in 100 years”. Except the same thing happened 10 years ago. And three years before that. All along the same stretch of water.One morning, before he was lent some waders, the river was so high that he had to leap from his boat, wearing nothing but a pair of jelly shoes and his pants, and push his bike through the flood water to higher ground. There, thankfully, he could get dressed for work in the clothes he had stuffed into his rucksack. The next day, he was completely flooded in, with a ukulele, three potatoes and some old chair legs to burn if things got really desperate.It is unsettling to have that silty brown tideline creep up the skirts of your city. To walk down streets that have turned suddenly into rivers. To watch the water line slide unstoppably over benches and garden walls and floorboards.While swathes of Oxford were under water, I went out with a researcher, Jamie Clarke, and interviewed people living in the houses over the river from my father’s boat, including a 91-year-old woman called Betty and our MP, Anneliese Dodds. Betty was in the same house she had been in 10 years ago, when Jamie had first interviewed her. Did she, I wonder, think the flooding had anything to do with the climate crisis? Of course she did.It was sobering to hear the way people living inside bricks and mortar were preparing for this sort of weather to happen more often and more violently. Perhaps, after all, it is better to lose your house and end up living on a boat, like my father, than to have your concrete foundations sunk into the middle of a floodplain. Unless we all want to start heading off to work in our jelly shoes and pants.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Compared with the enormous size of their jaws, gulper eels (Eurypharynx pelecanoides), also known as pelican eels, have one of the tiniest skulls of any animal. The enormous jaws allow them to swallow whatever prey they happen upon in the vast space of the deep sea, where food is hard to come by.“The upper and lower jaw are so big that when its mouth is closed and folded up it’s almost half the length of its body,” says Yi-Kai Tea, a Chadwick Biodiversity Fellow at the Australian Museum in Sydney. “The head is right at the tip.” The metre-long gulper eels live at depths of more than 7km under the surface, although typically they are found in the midnight zone at about 1,000 metres. Their jaws unfold to immense dimensions, like an umbrella.“A lot of these deep-sea creatures are so intractable that they often come with schematic drawings of how they work,” says Tea. “Their anatomy is so far removed from what is normal, it’s hard to imagine what they’re actually like.”A gulper eel shows just how stretchy its body is.Pelican eels were one of the many deep-sea fish found on a recent expedition to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean, exploring little-known waters around giant underwater mountains. Tea was a fish expert on board, part of the team that slowly dragged a four-metre-long beam trawl net just above the seabed, as far as 6,000 metres down. After four or five hours the net would come back up to the ship and the team would sort the catch.“That’s the fun thing about being on an expedition like that … you never really know what is coming up in those nets,” says Tea. “It’s really just the luck of the draw.”Q&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world’s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth – and how much there is to protect. Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.As well as their massive mouths, gulper eels also have incredibly stretchy skin that can accommodate an enormous gulp of food. A young gulper eel showed just how stretchy they can be, when it was caught on camera in 2018 on the flanks of a seamount 1,425 metres underwater in the Papahānaumokuākea marine national monument near Hawaii.Inflated with water, it looked like a black balloon with two beady eyes. Then it folded its skin away and swam off with sinuous waves of its snaky body. It remains a mystery what that particular fish was up to. Perhaps it was trying to look big and scare off the noisy, bright submersible that was filming it, or perhaps it was just stretching its muscles. “I don’t think anyone really knows,” says Tea.Discovered in the deep: the extraordinary sawshark with a weapon-like snoutRead moreThe Cocos (Keeling) expedition was the first time Tea saw a fresh, net-caught gulper eel and witnessed its incredibly black skin, which soon fades in preserved museum specimens. “They’re so intensely, deeply black it looks weird and fake,” says Tea. “It’s almost as if you’re looking into a black hole,” he says. “That really blew my mind.”A recent study revealed how gulper eels and other deep-sea fish engineer their ultra-black skin. Melanin pigments are arranged in such a way that photons of light bounce between them, like a ball pinging around inside a pinball machine, and few escape. More than 99.7% of the light that falls on the skin gets absorbed, making gulper eels almost as black as the artificial superblack coatings constructed from carbon nanotubes that suck in light and let next to none back out.Ultra-black skin helps gulper eels avoid being illuminated by their bioluminescent prey, such as lanternfish, which have glowing lights along their bellies. “It doesn’t want to be seen, it wants to be well hidden,” says Tea. “The outer blackness of its skin helps it to blend in well in its surroundings.”"

        "text": "“At first, it’s hard to believe – you need to convince yourself it’s not a dream,” says the Ecuadorian biologist Elicio Tapia. “When you find a species thought to be extinct, after searching for so many years, it’s unbelievable to see it again.”Tapia was part of the team that in 2016 “rediscovered” the rare longnose harlequin frog (Atelopus longirostris) – a striking little yellow-spotted frog with a pointed snout that hadn’t been seen since 1989 and was presumed extinct.The endemic frog, first described by zoologist Edward Drinker Cope in 1868, was once abundant in Ecuador’s biodiverse Intag Valley region in the tropical Andes. But in the late 1980s it rapidly disappeared, along with around a dozen other amphibian species.Tapia spotted the frog during an amphibian survey funded by the environmental organisation Defensa y Conservación Ecológica de Intag, and led by Dr Luis Coloma from the Jambatu Center for Amphibian Research and Conservation in Quito. “When I was a child, I used to swim in the Esmeraldas River, where I’d see many specimens of Atelopus longirostris,” recalls Tapia. “So this species was very familiar. When I saw it, I knew immediately it was an atelopus. Up close, it was easy to see the characteristic coloration [brown with yellow spots], the shape of the bones, and the long nose with a yellow spot on its tip.Lost and found: how a photographer sniffed out the magnolia species not seen for a centuryRead more“There was an immense sense of joy, relief, and excitement. I ran downhill to share this amazing discovery with the others. But after the excitement, you confront the reality: most of the time there’s no support for protection, there’s no national conservation plan, and you quickly realise the species’ survival is at risk.”The International Union for Conservation of Nature has moved the longnose harlequin frog from “extinct” to “critically endangered”. But having been brought back from the dead, as it were, the frog hasn’t been given much time to rest – it currently finds itself at the heart of a big legal battle to protect Intag from copper mining.“The longnose harlequin frog is becoming a powerful and charismatic symbol to help save Intag,” says Coloma. “Intag is like a Noah’s Ark for biodiversity, and frogs in particular. The impact of Elicio’s finding was huge.”Before it was ‘rediscovered’ in 2016, Atelopus longirostris hadn’t been seen since 1988. Photograph: Gustavo Pazmiño Otamendi/PUCEThe longnose harlequin frog, along with a new type of rocket frog discovered in 2019 and named Intag’s resistance rocket frog, has been cited by campaigners in legal challenges to protect Intag from plans for an opencast copper mine. “Leonardo DiCaprio has put out several tweets supporting the conservation of the region, so people are beginning to call the longnose harlequin frog ‘Leonardo DiCaprio’s harlequin frog’,” says Coloma.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Jambatu Center has worked on a successful breeding programme, which has produced 200 lab-raised frogs. A conservation plan has also been proposed by local communities and wildlife organisations.The frogs’ future in the wild, though, will depend on the court’s decision on the copper mine, which is likely to be delivered in 2023.“I’d like to see the judge ban mining operations in the Intag region and to see this species recovered and returned to the forests in many of its historical sites,” says Coloma. “It’s important for so many reasons: ethical, biological, ecological, economic … The future will tell us the importance of what we lost if we don’t save species such as this.”"

She sighted the bird, or possibly two different individuals, multiple times in the town of Sheringham on Monday.Extraordinary numbers were reported in Ireland in recent days, where up to 60 alpine swifts have been recorded so far, according to the Irish Rare and Scarce Bird news group.The previous record for most alpine swifts observed together in Ireland was five. This has been broken twice in the last week or so, first by a flock of seven birds in Dungarvan, County Waterford, and then by a group of nine seen flying together near Dublin, said Owen Foley, an analytical chemist and amateur birdwatcher who helps to run the group.On Monday, Christopher O’Sullivan, TD (member of parliament), tweeted a video of one of the swifts flying in County Cork.The bird news website Bird Guides suggested that a funnel of south-westerly winds had helped to push the swifts towards Britain and Ireland.“It is unprecedented. Usually we’re lucky to get two or three birds a year,” said Rob Robinson, of the British Trust for Ornithology, who has studied seasonal migration in alpine swifts.He noted that the species had spread further north during the postwar period, with the birds increasingly making their nests in the roof crevices of buildings in Europe, rather than their natural breeding habitat of openings in cliffs or caves. However, he added that no one was sure what was behind this switch in preference.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Such a phenomenon has been documented with willow warblers in England, for instance.Foley doubted that the climate crisis had influenced the present boom in alpine swift numbers and he expected them to move back to the continent to breed. But he predicted that the birds would continue arriving in Ireland for some days to come.“They’re still out there, they’re going to be popping up for the rest of the week at least, I think,” he said."

In a few weeks’ time, as part of a conservation project, they will leave their small shed in the North Yorkshire port of Whitby for the open sea.Whitby is Europe’s third-largest lobster port. About 100,000 lobsters are landed there each year, providing jobs for 150 people.\nFishing vessels moored at the quayside in Whitby, Europe’s third-largest lobster port\nJoe Redfern, who runs the Whitby Lobster Hatchery, hopes to release the same number each year from his tanks. “We want to make sure that the marine environment is protected and the lobster populations are conserved for the future,” the 31-year-old biology graduate says.\nHatchery manager and marine biologist Joe Redfern at work with the juvenile lobsters\n\nRedfern uses his phone to record the juvenile lobsters, which are decanted into their trays by means of a simple dropper. They are kept apart in segmented trays to prevent them eating each other\nLobster pots are piled high on the port’s quayside, but the crustaceans were once part of a much bigger fishing industry in Whitby. The town’s traditional catch of whitefish has collapsed, a result of overfishing and the climate crisis. Fishers also blame EU quotas, before Britain quit the bloc.\nVolunteer and fisher Jonathan Parkin inspects an egg-bearing adult female lobster in the hatchery\nIn the 1990s, there were about 30 big fishing boats in Whitby, but by 2005, there was only one, according to Redfern, who has been a fisher himself. Whitefish such as cod and haddock have migrated north to colder waters. Some of the Whitby boats moved with them, relocating to the Scottish ports of Peterhead and Aberdeen. “The guys that didn’t want to move, they had to migrate into shellfish,” says Jonathan Parkin, a 43-year-old fisher.A new disaster struck the Whitby fishing industry from late 2021. Lobsters, crabs and other crustaceans began dying off in huge numbers. The cause remains a mystery. Some locals suspect a government project to dredge for a new post-Brexit freeport in the Teesside region, to the north of Whitby. They wonder if the dredging has stirred up chemical pollutants in the seabed – a legacy of Teesside’s past as a centre of heavy industry. However, a government-commissioned study by independent experts said in January that it was “as likely as not that a pathogen new to UK waters” was the cause.\nDeckhand Billy Ellis cleans lobster pots before another trip out to sea\n\nSkipper James Cole helps to get the lobster pots ready for a fishing trip; the tattooed arm of first mate George Lamplough\nPlans for the hatchery began before the mass die-off. But Redfern said it could help “bring a bit of hope back into the communities” and show that “something can be done to start to rebuild”.The project involves harvesting female lobsters, each carrying thousands of eggs, from the North Sea so that they can hatch safely. In the open sea, the survival rate for lobster larvae is one in 20,000, or 0.005%. By allowing them to grow in a protected environment, Redfern hopes to increase that to 20 or 30%.\nA tiny juvenile lobster in a segmented tray – the aim is to release 100,000 into the sea to help protect the region’s lobster industry for the future\nAs they feed and develop in their hatchery tanks, the larvae are separated when they reach the stage at which, in the wild, they are liable to eat each other. After two to three months, they are ready for the sea. “Obviously, when we release them, they won’t all survive, but what we’ve done is protect them over the larval stage, which is their most vulnerable period,” says Redfern.The project raised more than £100,000 to get off the ground, from crowdfunding and corporate sponsorship. Individual donors can sponsor a lobster and follow it until it is introduced into the sea. The idea came from the Whitby fishing community, drawing inspiration from a similar project in Cornwall. “It’s massively, massively important,” says Parkin, who is involved in the scheme. “We’re releasing future generations of lobsters for future generations of fishermen.”\nDeckhand Ben Hinchley cleans lobster pots on the quay so they’re ready for the next trip out into the North Sea\n"

They are also unable to access unemployment benefits because they are still technically employed.Money owed to the Geelong Cats has risen to $75,000, according to sources with knowledge of the arrangement, which includes unpaid hospitality packages that typically involve premium match-day seating and food and beverages.The football club declined to comment.Recharge had planned to build a lithium-ion battery plant in Geelong, south-west of Melbourne, rebuilding the town’s manufacturing capabilities with modern technology to provide batteries for electric vehicles.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nIt took on a second major project this year after successfully bidding for collapsed UK battery company Britishvolt, which included plans for a large battery plant in Northumberland to form the backbone of an electrified British automotive industry.Recharge won the UK bid but failed to make the final payment to administrators. Ernst & Young said in a statement to Guardian Australia it was recovering outstanding amounts owed by the buyer.While Recharge is trying to still get the UK deal done, Australian employees are owed up to three months’ pay, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the situation. Employees in the UK and the US are also owed outstanding wages.Additionally, Recharge owes money to Geelong’s Deakin University after the organisations formed a partnership to advance various technologies, according to the sources.Deakin did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Last year, Deakin awarded Recharge $10m, representing one-fifth of a $50m grant the university received from the federal government.Earlier this year, Recharge’s parent company announced it would give $10m to Deakin for AI research, although it’s unclear if all of the funds were transferred.Recharge sits under the umbrella of New York-based investment firm Scale Facilitation, headed by Geelong-raised founder David Collard. Most Australian employees working for the groups get paid through a different company called SaniteX Global.Collard acknowledged receipt of questions from Guardian Australia but did not respond.

Questions mount over Australian company hoping to revive BritishvoltRead moreA spokesperson for Scale said at the time the company would fully cooperate with authorities: “The company denies any wrongdoing and is working with legal and other advisers to defend any matters arising from these discussions.”The police raid and mounting financial problems rub against the exuberance on show when Scale opened its office in the World Trade Centre late last year, attended by Marles and Dutton, who both gave speeches.Marles, who was born in Geelong, said: “It is going to be a really significant employer in our home town; it’s going to be an enormous contributor to our economy.”Marles did not respond to questions on Tuesday.Recharge’s pitch leaned heavily on strategic alliances, making batteries using Australian minerals, including lithium, backed by US technology.When it won the UK bid, it promoted its business as fitting in neatly with Aukus, the trilateral security pact between the three nations. The batteries were designed to be free from Chinese and Russian materials.Collard had developed numerous relationships with Geelong businesses and organisations, including setting up bursaries to support students to attend his old school, St Joseph’s College, Geelong.He also promised to give workers at the future battery factory free membership to the Geelong Cats, and a $1,000 bonus if the club won the premiership, as it did in 2022."

Don’t throw them away if you live in France, where the government will pay a “repair bonus” to have them mended in a new scheme aimed at cutting waste.An estimated 700,000 tonnes of clothing is thrown away in France every year, two-thirds ending up in landfill.From October, people will be able to claim back between €6 and €25 of the cost of mending clothes and shoes in workshops or at cobblers that have joined the scheme.Bérangère Couillard, the secretary of state for ecology, announced the financial incentives during a visit to a responsible fashion hub in Paris. The repair bonus will be paid from a €154m fund the government has set aside for the next five years, she said.When it comes to rich countries taking the environment seriously, I say: vive la France | George MonbiotRead moreShe invited all sewing workshops and shoemakers to join the scheme, which will be run by the eco-organisation Refashion. “The goal is to support those who carry out repairs,” Couillard said during the visit. This would encourage workshops and retailers to offer repair services with “the hope of recreating jobs”.More than 100bn textiles – the terms covers clothing, shoes and household linen – are sold worldwide annually. In France, this amounts to about 10.5kgs a year for each person.Refashion aims to encourage people not only to repair and reuse, but to reduce the amount of textiles they buy and to donate those they no longer want. It says about 56% of the donations can be used again and 32% can be recycled into something new.The repair bonus scheme is part of a wider push by the French government, starting at the end of last year, to reform the textile industry, one of the most polluting on the planet, and to combat what is termed fast fashion.Clothing and textile shops must also label items with the material used and the country where it was produced and manufactured.Measures to encourage consumers to repair, reuse and recycle clothing follow a similar scheme offering bonuses to those who have household appliances repaired.In 2020, France passed a law aimed at changing production methods and consumption habits in relation to household goods in order to cut down on waste, conserve natural resources and limit damage to biodiversity while addressing the climate crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Every big party bar the far right promised to keep the planet from heating 1.5C.The coalition government between the Social Democrats, Greens and liberals has nearly torn itself apart fighting over policies to clean up the economy. The liberals and opposition Christian Democrats have framed proposals to phase out combustion engine cars and new gas boilers as an attack on freedom. However, laws to make it easier to build wind turbines and solar panels have been pushed through with little backlash.Germany strengthened its climate law two years ago after the top court ruled the previous version was “partly unconstitutional”. But sectors like buildings and transport have since failed to meet their yearly targets. The government’s scientific watchdog said the transport minister’s last “immediate action plan” was too weak even to assess. The cabinet has now decided to scrap sectoral targets.FranceEU states must bridge ‘planning gap’ in order to hit climate targets, report warnsRead moreFrance aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050. But while it plans to go slower than Germany, it is already closer to the target. In 2021, it spewed half as much greenhouse gas as Germany, mainly because of a vast fleet of nuclear power plants making low-carbon electricity.France wants half of its energy to come from nuclear power by 2035 and 40% of its electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030.But France has struggled to cut emissions from agriculture, which are the highest of any country in Europe, and transport. In 2018 the “yellow vest” protest movement forced French president Emmanuel Macron to ditch a planned hike on fuel taxes.This May the Conseil d’État, France’s top court, found “no credible guarantee that the trajectory of reducing greenhouse gas emissions shall be effectively respected”.ItalyEurope’s third biggest polluter has a net zero goal of 2050.In a draft national energy and climate plan, it said it aims to use renewable sources to make 65% of its electricity by 2030 and cover 40% of its energy demand.Italy relies heavily on fossil gas for heating and power, mostly from abroad. Its clean energy industries have grown slowly over the last 10 years, though recent reforms are set to pick up the pace of installations. Italy is also offering a “superbonus” tax break to insulate homes.Yet as heatwaves killed people in July, the environment minister said he did not know “how much [climate change] is due to man or Earth”.

        "text": "After decades of pollution, chronic underinvestment and presiding over a fundamentally broken water system, water companies in England have finally apologised for the disgraceful state they have left our rivers and seas in and promised to change. But how on earth can we trust them?Of course, we welcome the industry finally taking responsibility and any additional investment to fix our broken system, but the money may prove too little and the apology too late. These companies have had ample opportunity to put things right and invest in their infrastructure. Meanwhile, surfers, swimmers and paddleboarders, from St Agnes to St Andrews, have been paying the price, risking becoming sick by simply entering the water.Looking at the detail of the announcement, it all becomes pretty farcical, pretty quickly. Their apology and subsequent plan is built upon the assumption that ultimately they can get customers to foot much of the cost of the planned £10bn investment through unspecified increases in their bills. This is unacceptable on so many levels. We, the customers, have already paid for the water companies to do their job and deal with our waste. We should not have to do so again, especially in the middle of a cost of living crisis.And it’s clear that water companies have the funds to pay for this investment themselves if they weren’t so focused on lining shareholders’ and executives’ pockets. Last year alone, companies rewarded their chief executives with £16.5m and paid out £965m to shareholders in dividends. We understand that water companies need to attract investment and talent to these complex jobs, but if they are not complying with their basic legal requirements to treat sewage effectively then nobody deserves to be rewarded.It’s not yet clear whether the £10bn being announced today is enough to restore all of our rivers and seas to good health and keep waters safe. But what we do know is that priority must be given immediately to tackling those overflows that cause the most harm to people and the environment, so that we can end sewage pollution into bathing waters and high-priority nature sites by 2030. Water UK says the plans by water companies in England will cut the number of overflow incidents by up to 140,000 each year by 2030, compared with 2020.We recognise that water companies have committed to increase transparency and make sewage spill data more available to the public, but yet again this doesn’t appear to be a gesture made in good faith. It’s a legal obligation placed on them by a government that is starting to panic in the face of the sewage scandal.When the UK entered the EU we were nicknamed the “dirty man of Europe”. Tough regulation and enforcement helped change that narrative, but the sewage scandal, and our government and regulators’ inability to properly hold the polluting water industry to account, has brought that shameful name back.We demand urgent change now. We are calling for a cap on CEO bonuses and an end to shareholder pay-outs, unless water companies comply with environmental regulations. And we want regulators to properly enforce the law and hold water companies to account. We have had enough of the PR exercises that water users across the UK are now wise to. Thousands have signed our petition to end profiteering from pollution, and communities up and down the country are primed and ready to paddle out to show their frustration at the sewage scandal in our mass paddle-outs this Saturday. If today’s apology is going to be a turning point in the journey to end sewage pollution, and reset the industry’s relationship with the public, it must be backed up by sustained investment, with the money coming from industry itself. Action, not just words, is what is required.The past few decades appear to show that if we give these water companies an inch, they will take a mile, so we can’t be distracted by their pledges to change. Campaigners across the UK will keep up the fight until we end sewage pollution, and we need the government and regulators to uphold their side of the bargain, and hold this industry to account.We won’t be fooled by smoke and mirrors. We will continue to demand better for our rivers, seas, people and planet until we end sewage pollution for good.\nHenry Swithinbank is policy manager for Surfers Against Sewage\n"

        "text": "Some birds have developed immunity to avian flu, according to scientists who say there are “encouraging signs” that the deadly virus could kill fewer birds this winter.The current H5N1 bird flu outbreak, which started in 2021, has been the worst recorded, and is thought to have killed millions of wild birds. Mortality rates appeared to be very high among wild birds, but it was not known how many survived and gained immunity.Preliminary research by a consortium of scientists has confirmed that two populations of seabirds now have immunity. They took blood samples of northern gannets on Scotland’s Bass Rock – which were hit hard by avian flu in 2022 – and found that 30% of them had antibodies.Britain is home to two-thirds of the world’s northern gannets, and ornithologists are particularly concerned about the species – Bass Rock is the world’s largest colony. The researchers also tested shags, and found that about half had immunity.“This is the first evidence [of immunity] in seabirds,” said Prof Ian Brown, head of virology at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). “It is giving us insights into populations that we have never seen exposed to this virus before.”The research was done by the FluMap consortium, which is led by the APHA, and their key findings have been published in Ibis, the International Journal of Avian Science.Turkeys in a barn. Last year, amid the UK’s largest outbreak of bird flu, poultry farms had to keep livestock inside but this year there have been far fewer cases.  Photograph: Nathan Stirk/GettyThe sample size was small: about 30 birds for each population. Brown said it was extremely challenging catching wild birds and taking blood samples (which is partly why it has not been done before). But the findings support observations from conservationists that some birds appear to have acquired immunity – notably gannets, whose typically blue irises turned black after surviving infection.It is not known how long immunity will last, as avian flu changes quickly, or what percentage of birds survived getting the disease initially. Seabird populations are slow to recover because they typically only have one or two offspring a year, so there are still concerns about long-term impacts.Researchers now want to test other wild birds, especially those living on farms, to find out more about how the virus is getting into poultry sheds. The virus can travel only short distances – less than 10 metres, researchers say – so is unlikely to be spread through airborne transmission between farms. This suggests transmission is mostly via wild birds.Researchers are now watching anxiously to see what happens this winter. October is a month of uncertainty due to the influx of migratory birds and the possible new variants they might bring with them.Between 1 October and 28 October 2022, there were 58 confirmed cases in poultry in Britain. This year, there have so far been none in October. Globally, there are very few poultry cases in northern Europe, and a handful in wild birds. “If you compare that to the same period last year, it is quite different,” said Brown.Centre of deadly bird flu outbreaks shifts from Asia to Europe and AfricaRead moreHe added: “We’re in a very uncertain window at the moment, and we won’t be advocating any dropping of biosecurity standards. Far from it, because this is a very unpredictable virus and an unpredictable disease. But at the moment, they’re encouraging signs.”The H5N1 virus has multiple genes that can switch and evolve together to spread the virus quickly into a wide range of species. When the latest outbreak started, it was because changes to the virus made it much deadlier and more transmissible. Recent changes in the dominant strain of H5N1 in the UK suggest it could now be changing to become less virulent.This new finding follows research published in Nature that shows the centre of bird flu outbreaks has shifted from Asia to Europe and Africa. There are still concerns about it reaching new parts of the world, particularly Antarctica, as wild populations migrate from South America.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"

        "text": "A climate activist has been jailed for six months after pleading guilty to taking part in a peaceful slow march protest on a London road.The sentence handed to Stephen Gingell, 57, is thought to be the first jailing under a new law that critics say makes anyone walking in a road liable for prosecution for “interference with key national infrastructure”.Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023 bans any act that prevents newspaper printing presses, power plants, oil and gas extraction or distribution sites, harbours, airports, railways or roads “from being used or operated to any extent”, with a potential penalty of 12 months in jail.Gingell, a father of three from Manchester, was one of about 40 supporters of Just Stop Oil who spent about 30 minutes marching on Holloway Road in north London at about 4pm on 12 November, the climate campaign group said.He pleaded guilty to breach of section 7 at a hearing that same month at Wimbledon magistrates court. On Thursday, his case was transferred to Manchester magistrates court, where he was sentenced to six months.Just Stop Oil has been campaigning since 2022 for the UK government to stop all new fossil fuel production. The campaign’s “guerrilla tactics” were cited by the Home Office when it introduced the Public Order Act’s tough new anti-protest measures to parliament.Police began using section 7 to tackle Just Stop Oil’s protests at the end of October, arresting 60 people taking part in a march in Parliament Square. In a campaign of slow march protests carried out by the group between then and 4 December, 470 of the group’s supporters were arrested 630 times, with about half of those arrests under the new law.A spokesperson for the campaign said: “Section 7 of the Public Order Act 2023, a law drafted by the fossil fuel lobby, was introduced in April by Priti Patel, and covers ‘interference with the use or operation of key national infrastructure’. It seems this government has now made walking down the road, walking on the public highway an illegal act that is worthy of imprisonment.“How many fathers will be imprisoned before those planning to kill us are stopped? New oil and gas will see millions upon millions lose their homes, livelihoods and lives. Protected by the government, by failed politicians, by the police, those committing genocide continue to walk free, those protesting the killings are banged up. Whose side are you on?”The human rights organisation Liberty criticised Gingell’s sentencing. Katy Watts, a lawyer at Liberty, said: “It is shocking to see such harsh sentences handed down to protesters. This is yet another unnecessary and draconian law introduced by a government that is hell-bent on discouraging people from standing up for what they believe in. It is a clear attempt to silence people and for the government to hide from all accountability.“Protest is a fundamental right, not a gift from the state. Government should be protecting our right to protest, not criminalising it.”"

        "text": "Labour is promising to “rewire Britain”, making its case to the UK’s rural communities that it will connect farmers and businesses to the National Grid at record-breaking speed.The pledge comes as Rishi Sunak faces a battle over electricity pylons with the trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, and former ministers urging him to pull the plug on crucial grid infrastructure.At the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) conference on Thursday, Labour’s Steve Reed, the shadow environment secretary, will promise to get infrastructure – that is, pylons – built quickly to connect rural people to the grid. He will pledge to reduce the wait for farmers and landowners to plug their renewable energy into the grid “from years to months”.Labour sources said they were happy to fight on the issue after speaking to “so many farmers and landowners who are stuck in the grid queue for years”.Renewable energy companies have to wait up to a decade to connect to the electricity grid. Local farms and businesses are also stymied by the slow connection times, which are the lengthiest in Europe.But there are fears that a new Conservative party internal row about pylon plans will cause Sunak to go slow on his aim to speed up grid connectivity.A growing number of Tories have been raising concerns about pylons, among them the former home secretary Priti Patel, who asked in parliament this week why the National Grid could not be built in the sea.She demanded ministers “build an offshore grid” and “pull the plug on these awful pylons”. The energy minister, Andrew Bowie, responded that an offshore grid would be more expensive and result in higher bills for customers, but said he understood the frustration of her constituents.Patel is part of the Offshore Electricity Grid Task Force, a group of 14 MPs who are campaigning against pylons. Its members include Badenoch and the former environment secretary Thérèse Coffey.Badenoch called for ministers to explore an offshore grid instead of onshore pylons, and Coffey said: “While I understand, for energy security, the government commitment to provide 40 gigawatts of offshore wind electricity by 2030, I’ve consistently made it clear that it’s essential our precious landscapes and communities are protected by placing the infrastructure in the appropriate location.” She also asked for an offshore grid to be contemplated.Kemi Badenoch is a member of the Offshore Electricity Grid Task Force group of Tory MPs Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PANational Grid said building the grid onshore was four times cheaper, and the Norwich to Tilbury pylon project, which will improve connections for many rural areas, would be more than £3bn more expensive if built offshore.Simon Cran-McGreehin, the head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said an offshore grid without onshore pylons made no sense. He said: “The proposed grid investments already include coordinated undersea cables to connect up the UK’s vast offshore wind potential – but at some point those lines have to come onshore to reach customers, otherwise it’s like a ring-road without any routes into town.”Groups of angry constituents are also rallying against pylons. In September, hundreds of people protested in Suffolk over plans to speed up grid connections by building pylons. They complained that their area would be “destroyed” by the pylons and said renewable energy needed to be transported in a “green way”.Chris Venables, the deputy director of politics at the campaign group Green Alliance, said: “It should be a shared, cross-party national mission to secure our energy independence, and the route to this is through clean, cheap renewable power. Expensive fossil fuels have wreaked havoc on the economy and pushed up bills for millions, so rapidly building out the power grid to accommodate new clean energy is a top priority.“People have genuine concerns about democracy in the planning process, and communities must feel the benefit from the energy transition, but we cannot afford to slow down. It’s politicians’ job to broker the deals needed to move us forward, not grandstand with unworkable propositions. Until we move beyond the current impasse, millions of people will continue to face sky-high energy bills.”A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said:“We’re driving forward the biggest reforms to our electricity grid since the 1950s – halving the time it takes to build networks, speeding up grid connections, supporting thousands of jobs and reducing bills in the long-term for families.“Households helping host crucial infrastructure could receive £1,000 off their electricity bills alongside benefits for their local community in recognition of their role in delivering cleaner and cheaper energy to homes and businesses.”"

        "text": "A white octopus sat on the seabed, gently waggling its short, stubby arms and peering with beady eyes into the camera of a deep-diving robot.It was 2016, in waters off Hawaii, at a depth of 4,290 metres (2.6 miles). No one had ever seen an octopus like it, and certainly not so deep. Based on its ghostly appearance, it was nicknamed Casper.Until then, the only cephalopods filmed at such depths were Dumbo octopuses, named after another cartoon character, seen swimming around as deep as 6,957 metres, with elegant, ear-like flaps on either side of their heads.Q&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world’s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth – and how much there is to protect. Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The sighting of Casper was a striking moment for Janet Voight, associate curator of invertebrate zoology at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. “This is totally new and different,” she says, recalling the discovery.That first glimpse of Casper threw up many tantalising mysteries. Why is it so pale? Most other octopuses have colourful chromatophores in their skin which change their appearance in an instant and act as camouflage to confuse predators.Is this a breakthrough in octopus evolution?Janet Voight, octopus expertEven in the deep sea, octopuses can be colourful, like the purple, warty Graneledone. Some use a cloak of dark skin pigments, seemingly to hide glowing, bioluminescent prey they grab in their arms and thus avoid alerting other predators. Voight guesses that Casper’s pallor may come down to a lack of pigments in its food.Another puzzle is the short arms, although Casper is not alone in having a limited reach. “The shallower and more tropical you are, the longer and thinner your arms,” says Voight.This trend towards shorter arms in deep-dwelling octopuses doesn’t have a definite explanation. Voight thinks that, rather than stretching out to grab food, they evolved an alternative tactic of twisting their bodies around so that their mouths, on the underside of their bodies, are directly over their food.Scientists have learned more about Casper by scouring five years of archived footage gathered on deep-sea surveys across the Pacific. They spotted dozens more like Casper perched on the seabed, from two distinct species.Unusually, the Caspers appear to lay eggs on tall sponges, rather than rocks. Photograph: MBARI (Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute)“It could be that they’re fairly common,” says Voight. “It’s just an indicator of how little we know about what’s down there.”For Voight, especially exciting were the Caspers with their arms wrapped around clutches of eggs stuck to tall sponges. Previously, she had theorised that seabed-dwelling octopuses need hard rocks to lay their eggs on. Further down, there could be fewer exposed rocks, limiting how deep they can go.Discovered in the deep: the snail with iron armourRead more“Casper showed there are ways around that by finding a sponge stalk,” she says. “Is this a breakthrough in octopus evolution?”The sponges themselves are attached to rocky nodules that lie scattered across swaths of abyssal plains and take millions of years to form.If other deep-sea octopuses are anything to go by, the female Caspers probably spend a long time guarding their eggs. An octopus from another species (Graneledone boreopacifica) was seen off the coast of California, on a steep escarpment in Monterey Canyon, brooding her single clutch in the exact same spot for more than four years.For now, the pale and mysterious Casper octopuses have not yet been officially named, because all we know of them comes from imagery; no one has been able to collect a specimen to study in detail.“With an octopus, you really need it in your hand,” says Voight."

        "text": "An oblivious Georgia homeowner was unaware a huge 3ft tegu lizard had taken up residence under her porch until eagle-eyed children in the neighborhood spotted it and told her, state wildlife officials said.The reptile was a non-native Argentine black and white tegu, the largest of its species that can grow up to 5ft and pose a threat to wildlife and people, the officials reported.They are using the episode to remind Georgia residents of state regulations that came into effect last year listing creatures including the Argentine tegu species, Nile monitors, African helmeted turtles, Chinese softshell turtles, and Indian rock and Burmese pythons as wild.A grace period extends until 4 December for owners intending to keep any of the listed animals as pets to tag and register them, or dispose of them to somebody licensed to keep them for solely scientific, educational or public exhibition purposes.Biologist Brett Albanese, assistant chief of the Georgia department of natural resources (DNR), said the woman was surprised to learn last month from the neighborhood children that a giant reptile was living under her house in Athens.“This is definitely an example of why we need to regulate these species. They can be difficult to keep and as they grow their owners may not want to care for them or be able to afford to,” he said.Dr Albanese was unable to say if the tegu had escaped or was released into the wild purposely, which would be illegal. But he said the potential impact to the state’s ecosystem could not be overstated.“I can’t emphasize enough how important it is to never release non-native species in Georgia. This helps protect native wildlife and prevent the need for additional regulations,” he said.South American species of tegus are not usually known for aggression, but can become agitated when cornered, searching for food or during mating season. They have a sharp bite and their long tails can whip quickly and cause injury.Albanese’s department has made efforts to eliminate tegus, but admits it needs the public’s help. According to state information, populations of tegus exist in at least two counties, Toombs and Tattnall, surviving on the eggs of native quail, turkeys, alligators and gopher tortoises.They also eat chicken eggs, fruit, vegetables, plants, pet food, carrion and small live animals, including gopher tortoises, a protected species.“As a non-native species they can be killed on private property with the landowner’s permission and using legal methods in accordance with local ordinances, animal cruelty laws and safety precautions,” the department says.“Tegus could spread exotic parasites to native wildlife and cause bacterial contamination of crops. Invasives compete with native wildlife for food and other resources. They can cause habitat damage and transmit diseases and parasites [and] prey on native wildlife.”Other southern states experiencing issues with invasive species have also previously enacted similar tagging and licensing laws. In Florida, known for its diverse array of flora and fauna, wildlife managers declared an official “tag your reptile day” in 2021 to counter the growing threat."

        "text": "Eco-friendly gardeners should be given a cut in their council tax, scientists have recommended, as research shows cities may have lost as much as 50% of their green garden space over the past two decades.Paving over gardens and using plastic grass has become a trend in recent years, which contributes to rising urban temperatures and biodiversity decline.Now, research from the University of Sheffield has suggested policymakers should offer incentives such as council tax or water bill discounts to encourage gardeners to use environmentally sensitive techniques to help combat climate breakdown and boost communities’ health and wellbeing.Prof Ross Cameron, an expert in landscape horticulture at the University of Sheffield and the author of the paper published in the journal Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, suggests financial incentives should be given to gardeners who ensure the area around their home is well-stocked with plants.Cameron said: “Gardens account for a third of all our urban areas and are vital spaces in terms of keeping our buildings and city environments cool in summer, absorbing rain to avoid flash flooding and providing an important refuge for wildlife.“Gardens need to be green and full of plants to be beneficial to the local environment, and some types of garden are more beneficial than others.”“The paradox is that many gardens are not actually green and some trends in garden design can be very damaging for the urban environment. We have paved them over to house the car, or provide sterile patio space; factors that increase urban temperatures and increase flooding risk.”The study recommends that rewards for sustainable gardening could include reductions to council taxes, water bills or assistance with resources. Cameron suggested offering these payments or discounts to house owners with more than 50% of their garden space planted.The report also suggests that banning environmentally damaging materials such as pesticides, or practices such as installing astroturf, could also benefit the environment.Traditionally private garden management has been up to the homeowner, but Cameron says a more radical approach is needed to tackle the climate emergency and biodiversity loss at a city level.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Many residents use artificial grass that kills much of the soil life underneath it, and when real plants are present, we wrongly assume we need to hit them with a cocktail of chemicals to keep them alive and free of pests. These chemicals pollute our watercourses and damage the ecological function of our gardens”.Prof Helen Woolley, head of the department of landscape architecture and also at the University of Sheffield, added: “The value of this research is it categorically states the value of a particular landscape type and how that links to different socio-environmental agendas. Many citizens quickly realised the value of their home gardens during the pandemic lockdowns, and this academic paper builds on and reinforces what we learned then. It is important that policymakers and planners take note.”"

        "text": "The Queensland government has identified 12 “renewable energy zones” across the state that will form the backbone of its $62bn plan to decarbonise its electricity supply.In plans to be released on Tuesday, the Palaszczuk government says it wants wind, solar and pumped-hydro projects to be concentrated in these zones and connected to a “super grid” of renewable power, storage and transmission lines by 2035 – just 12 years from now.Last year the state announced a target to generate 80% of its electricity from renewables by 2035 and to end its reliance on coal for power by the same year.Queensland is Australia’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, accounting for almost a third of national emissions. Electricity generation makes up one-third of Queensland’s emissions.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nQueensland’s minister for energy, renewables and hydrogen, Mick de Brenni, told the Guardian the new renewable energy zones would help secure community support for “the biggest economic transition project that Queensland has ever embarked upon”.“Our nation needs Queensland to succeed,” he said. “There’s work to be done by governments to lead communities through a process and to develop that support for change.“We want to establish Queensland’s transition as a best-practice case study for the nation.”The 12 proposed zones are split into three regions. Southern Queensland is earmarked for five zones, with four in central Queensland and three in the north of the state.About 22GW of new solar and wind projects will need to be connected by 2035 within the zones to meet its renewable targets, the government says.The state currently has 16GW of electricity generation, including 8GW of coal and 3.6GW of utility-scale solar and wind.By the end of the year, the Queensland government wants legislation put in place to allow the energy minister to designate the renewable energy zones. The government’s draft Renewable Energy Zone Roadmap sets out how the state will coordinate the massive effort, including establishing local consultation groups, expert panels and dedicated assessments of the potential for projects and jobs in each zone. It will be released for consultation on Tuesday.“This hasn’t been done anywhere else to this level of sophistication,” said de Brenni. “The transition in Australia is 10 years behind where it needs to be.“We’re taking deliberate steps to make sure we can meet our targets and our global obligations on time. This takes us from targets and concepts to real lines on maps and real projects, real contracts and real workers.”In the state’s far north, concerns have been raised about windfarm developments in environmentally significant areas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Labour has U-turned on its pledge to create a Scottish-style right to roam in the English countryside if elected, the Guardian can reveal.Instead of an assumed right of access, the party now says it will find other ways to create more access to land in England, after opposition from some landowners’ groups.Campaigners reacted with dismay at the news. There has been a recent groundswell of public campaigns involving mass trespasses, which have sometimes attracted thousands of people, asking for a general right to walk across the English countryside. There is currently a right to roam over just 8% of England.Wales, like England, is under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act (Crow) meaning there is a right to walk on open country (mountain, moor, heath and downland) and “registered common land”. There are no general rights to wander over the countryside in Northern Ireland.The previous shadow environment team, led by Jim McMahon, the MP for Oldham West and Royton, had committed to a Scottish-style right to roam, where there would be an assumed right for English people to walk around the countryside.The former shadow nature minister Alex Sobel, the MP for Leeds North West, told parliament earlier this year: “Labour’s approach, like in Scotland, will be that Labour’s right to roam will offer access to high-quality green and blue space in the rest of Britain. We will replace the default of exclusion with a default of access.“Research shows that people with a stronger connection to nature were more likely to behave positively towards the environment. It’s quite simple: the more people engage with nature, the more likely they are to protect it.”This idea was criticised by rural campaign groups including the National Farmers’ Union. Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, hinted that rural voters would not vote Labour if they implemented a right to roam policy, referring to it as an “attack on the countryside”.Labour sources told the Guardian this approach had now changed, and that instead they were working with rural groups to find ways to increase access without giving a widespread right to roam, where access is assumed across the whole country. The shadow ministerial team is considering reforming Crow instead. The 2000 act gives a legal right of public access to mountains, moorland, heaths and some downland and commons, alongside the more recently created England coast path.Toby Perkins, who since September has been the shadow nature and rural affairs minister, said: “We absolutely want to see access extended. Do we need to tread very carefully on this? Absolutely. We want to increase access to nature but we also need to look at it in terms of farmers and working collectively with them rather than a top-down approach.”The shadow environment secretary, Steve Reed, said that he would be “astonished” if increased access to nature would not be in the next Labour manifesto but added there was a need to “respect the needs of farmers, producers and growers not to have their crops damaged”. He added that Labour would be producing a white paper on access to nature.Campaigners have criticised the change in direction. Guy Shrubsole from the Right to Roam campaign said: “Piecemeal extension of the Crow Act won’t lead to equitable access for the people who need it most. It’s also an expensive and time-consuming approach. It took five years and millions of pounds to map access land when Crow was brought in, and resulted in a right to roam over just 8% of England, much of it very remote from where most people live – and it managed to create lots of access ‘islands’ that you can only reach by trespassing.“Scotland’s default right to access land and water responsibly, with sensible exceptions and backed by a well-promoted outdoor access code, offers a much better, cheaper and more workable model that England should be following. It’s also a vote-winner: polling shows 62% of the public support a Scottish-style right to roam for England.“We look forward to continuing to work with Labour as they develop their plans, and we’ll be stepping up our campaigning over the next year to show why England should follow Scotland’s lead on access.”A Labour party spokesperson said: “Let me be clear that under Keir Starmer’s leadership, Labour has never committed to a Scottish-style right to roam. We want people from every background to have responsible access to nature around them, with access to parks and wildlife and the opportunity to enjoy our great British countryside.”"

Many members, including Youngs, have threatened to stop sourcing from the fisheries if sustainable management is not achieved.This year, the Marine Conservation Society downgraded the sustainability rating of north-east Atlantic mackerel in its Good Fish Guide because of overexploitation. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) withdrew its blue-tick assurance of sustainability in 2019 for the same reason.“This is a collective failure by the coastal states,” said Neil Auchterlonie, project lead for Napa, a coalition of 50 retailers and suppliers set up in 2019 after MSC certification was lost. “There is a real frustration around the fact that there is no movement on this.”At a meeting of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission this week, Napa called for urgent agreement or a binding dispute resolution mechanism to be put in place.Conservations say that 44% more mackerel is being caught than is sustainable. Photograph: Roy Waller/AlamyWhile the countries agree in principle to the total catch limits set by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the scientific body that advises governments, their lack of agreement on quota allocation has meant states have set quotas unilaterally and these limits are exceeded.Last month, Napa wrote an open letter to government ministers in the UK, EU, Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Russia, urging them to “stop overfishing” and come to a “sustainable and unanimous” agreement on mackerel, herring and blue whiting quotas for 2024.But, after consultations between all the states with the exception of Russia, they released a statement regretting they “had not yet been able to come to an agreement, despite having made some good progress” and would reconvene by early 2024.Charles Clover, author and co-founder of the Blue Marine Foundation, said: “This is an overfishing disaster of potentially epic proportions and they are all looking the other way.” He said it reflected badly on all nations, including the UK, which could “lead by example and declare a lower quota”.“Instead, the UK has negotiated some irresponsibly set quota off Norway and given it to some of the richest people in the fishing business, while the rest of the industry is in decline. Huge fortunes are being made out of fishing the stock irresponsibly.”Erin Priddle, regional director for the Marine Stewardship Council in north Europe, said: “You can’t keep fishing above what the science says and expect things to be OK. Fish stocks are susceptible to crashes, as we’ve seen with the collapse of the cod stocks off the Grand Banks in the 90s, or the collapse of herring in the 60s.”Atlantic overfishing was already a problem. Then Brexit happenedRead moreA Defra spokesperson said: “We have exercised considerable restraint in our approach to the long-term management of mackerel stock, setting our quota at levels considerably lower than the stock in our waters and taking a science-based but pragmatic approach throughout the recent coastal state consultations.”“We will continue to work closely with other coastal states to secure a quota-sharing arrangement.”"

        "text": "Environmental groups are suing the US Environmental Protection Agency over pesticide-coated seeds they say have “devastating environmental impacts” and are spread largely without regulatory oversight.The suit alleges the neonicotinoid seeds are now spread on about 150m acres (61m hectares) of US farmland and up to 95% of the pesticide on the seed sheds, polluting nearby soil, water and air. The seeds are so dangerous to wildlife that just one can kill a bird, the groups note.Why does the US allow a controversial weedkiller banned across the world?Read more“They are highly toxic to pollinators, insects, birds, aquatic organisms that build the base of our food chain,” said Amy von Saun, an attorney with the Center for Food Safety (CFS), a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit. “Because the seeds represent so much neonicotinoid use, this is where all the devastation is coming from.”The CFS is a co-plaintiff in the suit with Pesticide Action Network North America. Neonicotinoids are a controversial class of chemicals used in insecticides widely spread on cropland to treat for pests, but which a growing body of science has found harms pollinators and other insects not targeted by the chemical.Neonicotinoids work by destroying an insect’s nerve synapse, causing uncontrollable shaking, paralysis and death.While neonicotinoids can be sprayed on cropland, about 95% of it is distributed via seeds. The chemicals are water soluble and easily leach into soils and streams, and clouds of neonicotinoid-laced dust released during seed plantings have caused mass bee die-offs, the groups say.Neonicotinoids from three major producers affect about 75% of all endangered species, the EPA recently found, and the UN reported cropland is now about 50 times more toxic than just a quarter of a century ago, contributing to an “insect apocalypse”. The chemicals are so destructive that the European Union banned their outdoor use while Canada has also imposed restrictions.Among the issues at the center of the lawsuit is the seeds’ minimal and unenforceable labeling. The suit asks a judge to compel the agency to require stronger and enforceable labeling.The suit also challenges the EPA’s exemption of the seeds from registration as pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (Fifra). Registration would trigger closer scrutiny of their environmental and health impacts, and force the EPA to weigh the seeds’ benefits against their costs. The agency would have to show the seeds do not cause unreasonable or adverse effects to the environment, as is the standard under Fifra.EPA science has found neonicotinoids harm endangered species while providing little benefit in terms of crop yield.“If you actually balance the benefit against the harms, it would not pass the Fifra test,” von Saun said.However, the EPA has claimed it has already thoroughly studied neonicotinoids and does not need to conduct reviews of the seed. The CFS in 2017 petitioned the Trump EPA to re-examine its exemption for the seeds and ban them. The EPA ignored the petition until CFS sued in 2021 to force a response, and months later the Biden EPA denied the petition. The new case challenges that denial as unlawful.“Because coated seeds have significant adverse effects on the environment, EPA cannot continue to avoid its duty to review, balance the costs and benefits, and mitigate harm by unilaterally exempting coated seeds from FIFRA,” the suit states."

This was approved in June 2022, allowing it to hire a terrestrial ranger to capture the vervet monkeys.In December, the territory’s ministry of tourism, economic affairs, transportation and telecommunication approved 100,000NAf ($55,000) funding per year for the project.Cull invasive mammals to save island species, experts urgeRead more“The foundation proposed two management options when requesting funding for these activities, one of which was a sterilisation programme and one which was a population management programme,” Hickerson said.“The funding received to execute the project was the minimum requested in order to start managing the population.”Eusebio Richardson, a ranger with the foundation, said the government funding is “essential” for the project’s success and has been used to purchase materials, equipment and training.“We were able to learn from an established trapper in St Kitts the most effective management practices,” Richardson said.“This is key to ensure that within the time allowed we can make an impact and protect the biodiversity of the island.”Hickerson said that because of how quickly they reproduce it “would be best” to capture or relocate the entire island’s monkey population.The foundation plans to meet with the relevant agencies from French St Martin this week to discuss their part in the project.The Réserve Naturelle Nationale de Saint-Martin said in 2021 that the introduction of non-native animals such as vervet monkeys was eroding its natural heritage."

He believes sustainable energy could be generated underground using residual warmth from the Zuidwal volcano deep under the Wadden Sea.“It started as a crazy idea,” said Salverda, a board member of Stichting Ontwikkeling Geothermie Friesland (Stogef), a community initiative. “These big wind turbines put a lot of pressure on our landscape but when there is no wind we have a problem. I have a background in the oil and gas world, I knew that there were a few volcanoes, and the [increased] temperature is going to the coast.”The Netherlands’ history as a major gas extractor means it has huge amounts of subsurface data. “We found out that there is a layer of porous stone, it’s nice and warm, about 90C, so wouldn’t it be an idea to use geothermal energy,” he said. “We want to take it in our own hands and work with the local government. Just like food, we need energy to be reliable, affordable and it should not be commercialised. And that’s the whole idea.”Using a geothermal “doublet” technique, water can be pumped up from the ground in a production well and the heat extracted in a heat exchanger before the water is reinjected via an injection well.The public energy company Energie Beheer Nederland believes 25% of Dutch heat demand could eventually be met by geothermal energy. There are 26 working non-volcanic geothermal energy projects, mostly heating greenhouses between The Hague and Rotterdam, and a national mapping project and plans to more than double geothermal production by 2030.Phil Vardon, a professor of energy geomechanics at Delft University of Technology, is leading the science programme for a 2.5km-deep geothermal project being drilled in Delft to heat the university campus plus the equivalent of 10,000 houses.“The volcano is a bit of a gimmick, but what it does seem to have done is to increase the temperature locally,” he said. “You can see this on temperature maps interpolated from drilling projects. One thing that isn’t so good is the ability for the water to flow – there’s a relatively limited thickness reservoir.”Still, Energiewerkplaats Fryslân, a network of professionals supporting local energy initiatives, has published an “exploratory investigation” into the potential of 500-metre or 3km-deep structures plus a district heating system, with a total estimated cost of between €143m and €188m. Johannes Lankester, the project leader, is positive, even if the local area would have to raise 30% of the total. “Technically, it is certainly very achievable,” he said. “The heat is there but we want ownership as a community. In Frisian, we call this MienskipsEnergie [community energy].”The local council of South-west Friesland wants to set up this public heating network and develop more alternative energy sources and is appealing for government and European help. “In around 2027 we hope to drill for geothermal heat for Bolsward,” a spokesperson said. “Geothermal is a good additional source in the desired energy mix.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A spokesperson said there was “too little known about the initiative to estimate the risks”.Diana Tronco, the chief executive of Inco-Drilling and an adviser to the project, believes it has potential. “There are some cases like in Groningen where people are afraid of drilling, but the advantage of geothermal is that if you drill two wells, one to extract water [and one to] inject it back, there’s a balance,” she said."

It certainly is from the UAE. We in the UAE are not shying away from the energy transition. We are running towards it.”Al Jaber is also chief executive of the UAE’s national oil company, Adnoc, which has brought him under heavy fire from climate activists. Many prominent climate campaigning groups, and politicians including several US lawmakers, have called for him to step down from the oil company role.But Al Jaber told the World Government Summit, an annual meeting organised by the UAE in Dubai, that the country was working to “transform entire industrial systems that still run on the energies of the first Industrial Revolution”.He set out the case for the UAE’s presidency of the Cop28 summit, the fortnight-long meeting of heads of state and government that will begin on 30 November. At the conference, governments will be expected to report on how much progress they have made on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in line with the commitments of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change.This “global stocktake” is expected to show that far too little has been done to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the key aspiration set at Paris, and which scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst ravages of climate breakdown.Al Jaber said on Tuesday: “We don’t need to wait for the stocktake to find out what it will say. We already know that we are way off track.

All while minimising the carbon intensity of the energy we use today,” he said.Investors must come forward with “lots of capital” to achieve these goals, Al Jaber said. “We need to ramp up investment across every area of decarbonisation and we should view these investments as an opportunity, not a burden,” he said. “In fact, economists estimate that decarbonising industry, the energy sector, power generation, transportation and food systems could create an additional $12tn in economic value by 2030.”In an implicit defence of his dual role, he added: “We have an unprecedented opportunity to engage the energy industry in a technological revolution that gets us to a climate-positive future. And yes, it is in our common interest to have the energy industry working hand in hand, and alongside everyone on the solutions that the world needs. That is just logical and makes sense.”Adnoc has benefited from the global oil and gas bonanza of the past year, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company’s drilling subsidiary, Adnoc Drilling, reported profits this week up by a third on last year.The company plans an expansion of its oil and gas production, which climate campaigners said ran counter to the Cop28 goal of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.Marta Schaaf, the director of climate, economic and social justice at Amnesty International, said: “Sultan Al Jaber, the chief executive of Adnoc, one of the world’s largest oil and gas producers, plans to increase the group’s production of fossil fuels – this is entirely incompatible with his role as president designate of Cop28. [He] cannot be an honest broker for climate talks when the company he leads is planning to cause more climate damage.”"

        "text": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is delaying plans to tighten air quality standards for ground-level ozone – better known as smog – despite a recommendation by a scientific advisory panel to lower air pollution limits to protect public health.The decision by the EPA Administrator, Michael Regan, means that one of the agency’s most important air quality regulations will not be updated until well after the 2024 presidential election.“I have decided that the best path forward is to initiate a new statutory review of the ozone [standard] and the underlying air quality criteria,’’ Regan wrote in a letter to the EPA advisory panel last month. The letter cites “several issues” raised by the panel in a recent report that “warrant additional evaluation and review’’.The review, which will last at least two years, will “ensure that air quality standards reflect the latest science in order to best protect people from pollution,”, Regan said.Regan’s decision avoids an election-year battle with industry groups and Republicans who have complained about what they consider overly intrusive EPA rules on power plants, refineries, automobiles and other polluters.The delay marks the second time in 12 years that a Democratic administration has put off a new ozone standard before an election year. Barack Obama shut down plans to tighten ozone standards in 2011, leading to a four-year delay before the standards were updated in 2015.Paul Billings, senior vice-president of the American Lung Association, called the EPA’s decision “profoundly disappointing” and a missed opportunity to protect public health and promote environmental justice. A recent report by the lung association showed that minority communities bear a disproportionate burden from ground-level ozone, which occurs when air pollution from cars, power plants and other sources mixes with sunlight. The problem is particularly acute in urban areas.Billings called the ozone rule “the public health cornerstone of the Clean Air Act,”, adding that “millions of people will breathe dirty air for many more years” as a result of the delay. An increased number of asthma attacks, sick days and even premature death are likely to occur, he and other public health advocates said.Raul Garcia, vice-president of policy and legislation for Earthjustice, called the delay “shameful” and unjustified. “The science tells us we are long overdue,” Garcia said.Democratic lawmakers also were disappointed. “Inaction threatens public health and puts those with underlying conditions such as asthma or lung disease at an elevated risk,’’ said the Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse. He and 51 other Democrats had urged swift action on a new rule.“Unfortunately we’ve seen the process for updating the ozone standards repeatedly swept up in political games that risk lives,’’ the lawmakers said in a 7 August letter to the EPA.Conor Bernstein, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, applauded the EPA’s decision “not to race ahead with an unnecessary revision of the ozone standards”, which have not been changed since 2015. The current standard was reaffirmed in December 2020 under Donald Trump, a Republican.The American Petroleum Institute, the top lobbying group for the oil and gas industry, said current ozone limits were among the most stringent in the world. “Any tightening of the standard could impact energy costs, threaten US energy security and impact businesses and American consumers,” a spokeswoman, Andrea Woods, said in an email.The EPA’s decision comes after two advisory panels – the EPA’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee and the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council – urged the agency to lower the current ozone standard of 70 parts per billion (ppb).“Based on the scientific evidence currently available, it is concluded that the level of the current standard is not protective with an adequate margin of safety,’’ the EPA panel said in a June report. A limit of 55 to 60ppb “is more likely to be protective and to provide an adequate margin of safety”, the panel said.Tomas Carbonell, a top official in the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, said the report by the scientific panel left the EPA with little choice but to launch a comprehensive review even though all but one panel member supported a stricter ozone standard.“When we’re looking at our national air quality standards, there’s really no way to cut corners around that process,’’ Carbonell said in an interview.The agency will convene workshops next spring to gather information and will release a review plan for action in late 2024, he said. A final decision could be years away."

The cost of removing the soft plastic is estimated to be $3.5m.The NSW EPA has asked supermarkets to either dispose of the waste in landfill, reprocess it, or export it internationally. Landfill is the only viable option as other nations are unwilling to accept contaminated soft plastic and that volume of plastic cannot be reprocessed domestically.Of the 15 locations, 11 are of such a concern that the EPA has notified Fire and Rescue NSW and has requested the operators take immediate action to mitigate risk.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe EPA chief executive, Tony Chappel, said thousands of customers had diligently collected soft plastic and dropped them at local supermarkets because “they trusted their waste would be diverted from landfill and recycled”.“The extent of soft plastic waste sitting in warehouses across NSW is very concerning and I know customers will be disappointed,” Chappel said.“These stockpiles are stored from the floor to the ceiling, blocking entryways and preventing adequate ventilation with the soft plastic estimated to fill about three-and-a-half Olympic-sized swimming pools.”Coles and Woolworths have six days to respond to the EPA’s clean-up orders.A Woolworths spokesperson said the company was surprised to receive the notice as REDcycle had indicated they had plans to deal with the stockpiles.A Coles spokesperson said the company was disappointed by the notice and was determined to find “a short-term solution” to allow recycling to return.Chappel said it was unfortunate the plastic would now be redirected to landfill but “regulatory action had to be taken to protect NSW communities”.“Our largest retailers have an important role to play in how we continue to reduce plastic waste and we are committed to working together so we can support opportunities and minimise risk,” Chappel said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We have been in intensive roundtable discussions with our industry stakeholders and funding partners to explore a range of long-term and sustainable solutions following the halting of the program late last year due to supply chain disruptions,” it said.Environmental watchdog charges REDcycle operators over secret soft plastics stockpilesRead moreIn December, the Victorian EPA found half a billion plastic bags meant to be recycled in at least six warehouses in Victoria, posing potential fire risks.The 3,000 tonnes of soft plastics were found during an examination of the REDcycle program in Victoria.Later in December, the Victorian EPA said the operators behind REDcycle, RG Programs and Services, had failed to provide information about the locations of warehouses secretly stockpiling hundreds of millions of bags.The federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has previously called on Australia’s two biggest supermarket chains to come up with a “viable solution” after they were forced to hit pause on the recycling scheme.Last year, REDcycle said the two companies that took the recycled material couldn’t accept any more, with a fire in a factory and “downturns in market demand” blamed.“Due to several unforeseen challenges exacerbated by the pandemic, REDcycle’s recycling partners have temporarily stopped accepting and processing soft plastics. This combination has put untenable pressure on the REDcycle business model.”"

Mining of rare earths, in particular, can generate large volumes of toxic material and processing is complex, giving China a large head start over other other nations.While Australia has large deposits of most minerals, it traditionally sends them offshore for processing.Last month the resources minister, Madeleine King, told a Darwin audience that included key allies and trading partners that China’s position in the market posed a strategic challenge to Australia.“Working together, like-minded partners can build new, diverse, resilient and sustainable supply chains as part of a global hedge against concentration,” she said.The government position represents a green light to the mining sector to pursue projects that produce minerals that go into low-emissions technologies such as electric vehicles, batteries and solar panels, as well as defence applications.There are also government grants available for companies developing mineral processing and manufacturing capabilities.Jubilee questions whether Australia can mine itself out of a climate crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "A creature that humans came very close to obliterating now offers hope that we may be able to find ways to tackle one of the most pernicious environmental poisons, say scientists.Their research has revealed that one of the world’s most isolated aquatic mammals, Arctocephalus philippii, can tolerate high levels of cadmium, as well as other metallic pollutants, without suffering ill effects.mapA. philippii is the second smallest species of fur seal and lives only on the Juan Fernández archipelago and one or two nearby islands in the Pacific Ocean, hundreds of miles off the coast of Chile. It was here that sailor Alexander Selkirk was marooned from 1704 to 1709, an experience that was fictionalised by Daniel Defoe in Robinson Crusoe after whom the archipelago’s main island is now named.In the early 18th century, the shores of Robinson Crusoe island teemed with Juan Fernández seals. However, the animals were hunted for their fur and meat with such vigour that around 4 million are now thought to have been slaughtered. By the 19th century, the species had disappeared and was believed to be extinct until, in the 1960s, a small colony was found in a cave on the island.Since then, the Juan Fernández seal, which has become a protected species, has slowly recovered and has a population of around 80,000 living on the island’s rocky shores, according to the most recent figures. Adults forage at sea while pups are born in November and December with soft black fur that fades to light brown in a few years.Little else was known about the seal’s detailed biology until scientists began studying the Arctocephalus philippii in detail recently – making some startling discoveries in the process. “We collected samples of their faeces and found they contained extremely high levels of cadmium and other elements such as mercury,” said Constanza Toro-Valdivieso of Cambridge University’s conservation research institute.“The discovery was very surprising,” she said. “Cadmium is poisonous to mammals but somehow these seals were processing it and passing it through their digestive systems and seem to be suffering little harm in the process.”Apart from the seals’ unexpected ability to tolerate high levels of cadmium, there was also a puzzle about its source. “The soil on the island is low in cadmium and so is the water around it,” said Toro-Valdivieso. “So where was the cadmium coming from, we wanted to know?”The answer appears to be that it probably came from food the seals ate, scientists concluded. “Some species of seal, like the Antarctic fur seal, have a diet rich in krill which they catch locally. However, Juan Fernández seals eat lots of squid and fish, and females are known to travel up to 500km to catch their prey.”Juan Fernández fur seals, which can swim very long distances to find prey. Photograph: Constanza Toro-ValdiviesoIn doing so, the seals would have to travel through the South Pacific gyre, a huge, rotating ocean current in which all sorts of debris gets trapped. “It is here they are most likely to come in contact with cadmium,” said Toro-Valdivieso, who has been studying the species for several years. The debris swept into the gyre includes man-made polymers containing cadmium, it is speculated, and this is being picked up by fish and squid and then ingested by the seals. “That is the most likely the source of the cadmium,” said Toro-Valdivieso whose team has just published a paper on their research in Royal Society Open Science.However, identifying the source does not explain how the Juan Fernández fur seal manages to shield itself from ingesting a substance so poisonous to other mammals. High levels were found not only in its faeces but in the bones of seals that had died of natural causes. The researchers also found high levels of silicon in their bones, which may be offsetting the impact of cadmium, they suggest.“The discovery that these animals appear to tolerate high levels of cadmium in their bodies has important medical implications, and it is very important for us to find out exactly how the Juan Fernández seal achieves this,” said Toro-Valdivieso. “It could be something to do with the animal’s genes or something else completely. It is an issue that we are hoping to follow up over the coming years. These animals have a lot to tell us.”"

The town considered “home” was Roccaraso, a ski resort where he scoffed a batch of freshly baked biscuits after breaking into a bakery in late 2021.Carrito was also spotted drinking from a fountain in the village, and would often stay overnight, sleeping among pine trees before going in search of food, rummaging through bins and dining off leftover pizza and sandwiches.The biscuit heist led to the bear being captured and banished to a remote area in the mountains, but he later returned, leading to a second capture in March last year and a period in an enclosure. That attempt to rewild him also failed, and Carrito returned to Roccaraso, where he was seen earlier this month on a ski slope.One explanation for Carrito’s sociability was his upbringing: he was one of four cubs born to a bear called Amarena. Such was the rarity of the event – on average, female Marsicans give birth to between one and three cubs – that the family attracted much attention. One of the first villages in which Amarena and her cubs appeared was Carrito, hence the nickname.The Marsican is a critically endangered subspecies of the brown bear living in the Apennine mountains that straddle the Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise regions.Their numbers across the area have dwindled to about 50 over the past two decades, thought to be the result of illegal hunting or the animals being hit by vehicles.“We are all very shocked,” Mena Ricci, a regional representative for the World Wildlife Fund, told La Presse news agency. “Unfortunately, this was a death that none of us wanted to hear.”Luciano D’Alfsono, a deputy with the Democratic party, said the death of Carrito was sad news “for all of us in Abruzzo”, adding that Carrito would be remembered for his “irreverent and free nature”.People also took to social media to express their sadness. “Juan was one of us,” wrote a commenter on Twitter."

They move like we would if we were cars with arms and legs: slowly, and not like cars at all.Their shells are part of them in another way, too: they have nerve endings, which is why tortoises enjoy being cleaned with toothbrushes or showers:this tortoise loves shower time pic.twitter.com/whQnNXzWST— Nature is Amazing ☘️ (@AMAZlNGNATURE) July 15, 2023It is also why it feels particularly good to touch a tortoise’s shell. It is like touching someone’s hand through glass or putting your fingertip on a static electricity ball. Cooler than you think it will be, and smoother, but not too smooth – not too reptilian and very much alive.Some tortoises, of course, live for a very long time. Harriet, a Galápagos tortoise, lived for so long that she was rumoured (incorrectly, but conceivably) to have met both Charles Darwin and Steve Irwin. She died because she kept hearing Americans referring to her as a “turtle”.I was in Greece recently so, naturally, a single image kept knocking on my shell: the ending of Rachel Cusk’s Kudos. The narrator is swimming in the sea. A man walks to the water. “He looked at me with black eyes full of malevolent delight while the golden jet poured unceasingly forth from him until it seemed impossible that he could contain any more,” Cusk writes. “The water bore me up, heaving, as if I lay on the breast of some sighing creature while the man emptied himself into its depths. I looked into his cruel, merry eyes and I waited for him to stop.”I was staying at a small hotel on the island of Agistri with my family (early coins, made on the Aegina, the larger island next door, bore the image of a tortoise). One morning, a manager at the hotel called my small daughter over to see something: it was a tortoise. The tortoise was named Platonus, she said: Plato, but a woman. Most people thought that the tortoise was male, but she liked to think it was female. She would only be out here for a few more weeks, and then she would crawl under the small shed that served as an office, burrow herself into the cool earth and stay there for the rest of summer. This is called Aestivation, rather than hibernation – many tortoises hibernate instead, in winter. (You can also hibernate a tortoise in a fridge).When it was cool enough to come out, Platonus would emerge, heroically, and “make urine” for a very long time, the manager said. Then she would be given as much lettuce as she wanted. What did lady Plato think about while she was in there? You could imagine her, holding forth while expelling a small yet significant stream, telling you what she had realised, that, “The measure of a woman is what she does with her power”, or that “No one is more hated than she who speaks the truth” or, “It is time we put a stop to Americans referring to tortoises as turtles once and for all.” You could imagine her as lady Saul Bellow, “an omniscient tortoise”, as described by lady Martin Amis. I have been thinking about Platonus ever since, but especially last week, worrying about her and whether it will still be cool enough in her burrow and hoping she has had enough to drink.\nHelen Sullivan is a Guardian journalist.

        "text": "The UK risks being left behind Europe on cycling growth, experts have warned, as cycle sales are down by a quarter on pre-pandemic levels and electric bike sales are plateauing following a boom in 2020.Although cycling levels have significantly risen since the pandemic – up 33% in the year to 30 July, according to Department for Transport (DfT) figures – sales of new bikes are not keeping pace.Those in the industry say more needs to be done to boost cycling uptake, including investing in infrastructure, secure cycle parking, and e-bike subsidies and charging networks.According to the latest market report from the Bicycle Association, cycle sales are down more than a quarter on pre-Covid levels from January to June. Sales of hybrid and children’s cycles, considered the two most “mainstream” categories, are worst affected, while “enthusiast” categories of road and gravel bikes have grown. Cycle sales are generally linked with cycling levels.“Things are very difficult right now,” said Steve Garidis, the Bicycle Association’s executive director. “Since May 2021 sales have been tracking at below pre-Covid levels, and if you take out the 2020 mega boom in cycling and sales, we’re now doing worse than we were before Covid hit.“When I look at the comparison between the UK and what’s happening in Europe it’s just a bit depressing, it’s sort of stark. There’s a definite sense that we’re being left behind, in terms of the size and value of the cycling market, but also left behind in terms of how people are getting around, both for leisure and for everyday [cycling trips].The association says the cost of living crisis is colliding with a dip in demand for bicycles, while prices have increased and the pound is weakening against the dollar.The charity Cycling UK believes part of the growth in cycling, which it says accelerated in March, is due to rising fuel prices, encouraging more people to switch to bikes for some trips, but warns that growth could be undone if fuel prices fall, unless cycling infrastructure improves.Garidis added: “Even e-bike growth, which had been pretty stratospheric and was driving the whole market, has stalled and is flat. Clearly e-bikes have got a massive application in bringing people to cycling … and we’re missing out.”E-cycles are the most natural “car replacement” and make up 9% of bike purchases in the UK. However, in Europe e-bikes make up 23% of sales. The British and German markets are similar in size but only 165,000 e-bikes are sold a year in the UK compared with 2 million in Germany.The government has set a target for half of all short trips to be walked or cycled by 2030 in England. In 2019 more than 60% of trips between one and two miles were driven. Research shows most people want to cycle more and support cycling investment but fear of motor traffic is the number one barrier.In May, Cycling UK was selected to run a national e-cycle support programme, to include short- and long-term e-bike loans and trials. However, the scheme appears to have stalled and neither Cycling UK nor the Department for Transport were able to discuss its status or when it would restart.About 190,000 electric cars were registered in the UK in 2021, just 15,000 more than e-cycles, but there are more than 30,000 e-car charging points and only 16 e-cycle charging points.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter – every weekday morning at 7amGaridis said: “I think that if you had partnerships, collaborations with national chains of coffee shops or hotels or other sorts of practical everyday destinations, where there might be mutual benefit in attracting new customers coming on two wheels instead of four, people [may] take notice and think ‘I could do that’.”However, he added, there are other pressing issues. “There’s just a massive lack of infrastructure in terms of parking at the moment. Obviously, there’s a big focus [on] cycle lanes, which is brilliant, but you need somewhere to lock the bike when you get to the other end.”Garidis urged the government to introduce subsidies for e-bikes: “It’s been the big difference between what the UK has done to promote uptake versus what Europe has done, and you can see the results.”A DfT spokesperson said: “E-cycles are a vital part of our ambitious action to increase active travel, and we are investing in a wide range of measures to support more people to use them and reduce emissions. This includes committing £42m to improve cycle storage at railway stations and cycle routes to stations, £8m for a national e-cycle pilot to boost take-up, and putting tax benefits in place for buying e-cycles through the Cycle to Work scheme.”"

Last year, the company paid out £878,000 in bonuses to directors.She said: “I understand the strength of feeling about the issues linked to river health which is why I’ve decided that this year I won’t be accepting a bonus.“This is the right thing to do and I’m committed to improving Yorkshire Water’s performance.”Sarah Bentley, who runs Thames Water and last year received a £496,000 payout, forwent her payout alongside the company’s chief financial officer, Alastair Cochran, who will also skip his bonus for 2022-23. He received £298,000 last year.Bentley said it “just did not feel like the right thing to take performance-related pay this year”.South West Water’s Susan Davy, who received £522,000 last year, will also not receive a bonus. “This is the right thing to do. We’re listening to our customers, we get it,” said Davy, whose company spilled untreated sewage 37,649 times last year. She runs Pennon Group, the listed owner of South West Water, and has turned down a pay rise for the past two years.The exact size of the bonuses that would have been due to the three executives has not been disclosed.An analysis of water companies’ annual reports released last month found the bonus pool for executives stood at an average of more than £600,000 at each company. In total, the 22 water bosses paid themselves £24.8m, including £14.7m in bonuses, benefits and incentives, in 2021-22.Emma Clancy, the chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, welcomed the decisions. She said: “Our recent research, Bridging the Gap, shows that bonuses add to people’s current frustration with the water industry and they would like much more openness and transparency on this issue. This announcement shows that people’s concerns are being listened to.”Gary Carter, a national officer at the GMB union, said it was “grotesque for water companies to post such mammoth profits while so many are repeatedly caught dumping sewage in our nation’s glorious seas and waterways”.He added: “GMB calls on all water bosses to waive their annual bonuses until Ofwat can confidently say the scourge of sewage dumping is under control.”The Financial Times reported on Monday that Britain’s privatised water and sewage companies paid £1.4bn in dividends in 2022, an increase from £540m the previous year.Last week, Macquarie, the Australian owner of Southern Water, the utility company criticised for discharging sewage into the sea, posted record profits after a boom in its commodities trading division."

In 2021, Legal & General Investment Management, one of the oldest fund managers in the City of London, backed a similar resolution put forward by Follow This at Shell’s AGM. The resolution was backed by 30% of Shell’s shareholders.Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said BP’s existing plans to reduce emissions do not go far enough because they rely on reducing the carbon intensity of the energy BP sells while absolute emissions are expected to keep rising until the end of the decade.The Paris agreement calls for all countries to limit their emissions in order to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5C above pre-industrialised levels by 2050. The 2020s are considered crucial years to cut carbon in order to remain on track.Van Baal has written to BP’s shareholders urging them to vote in favour of their resolution, saying it was “the only way to compel BP to reduce emissions this decade”.BP’s board has urged shareholders to vote against the resolution, saying it is “unclear”, “simplistic” and “disruptive”. The company added that it would threaten BP’s “long-term value creation”.In a separate climate revolt the three pension funds are expected to vote against the re-election of BP’s chairman, Helge Lund, in protest at BP’s decision to water down its green pledges earlier this year without shareholder consent. The local government pensions schemes LGPS Central and Brunel Pension Partnership are planning to join the funds in voting against Lund’s re-election.BP’s chief executive, Bernard Looney, originally set out a “net zero carbon” plan that included a goal to cut the company’s oil and gas production by 40% compared with 2019 by the end of the decade. However, he reset the target to 25% by 2030 in February after reporting the highest profits of BP’s 114-year history thanks to soaring oil and gas prices.Diandra Soobiah, Nest’s head of responsible investment, said the fund wants BP to invest more in low-carbon energy and renewables instead of new oil and gas sites.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Actions like this undermine the confidence shareholders have in the board and their corporate governance.”Campaigners at Reclaim Finance, which lobbies for the financial sector to align with global climate goals, has also called on investors to vote against the pay awards given to Looney and the chief financial officer, Murray Auchincloss, because the remuneration policy does not go far enough to take BP’s climate responsibilities into account.Separately, one of the largest proxy shareholder advisers, Glass Lewis, has recommended that shareholders vote against Looney’s £10m pay packet after the death of four workers last year. It was trimmed by only £78,329 to reflect the safety breaches."

The tool, which is live, will ask a series of questions – including how they heat their home, whether their home has solid or cavity walls, and if they are receiving any benefits. Customers will then be referred to either their energy supplier or council to take the next steps.The energy security secretary, Claire Coutinho, said the government was “determined to help families keep their homes warm through the winter months and save on their energy costs”.She added that the scheme would help hundreds of thousands of people, including some of the most vulnerable in society, get the upgrades their homes need, while cutting their energy bills.A fifth of those helped will be from low-income households, targeting those on means-tested benefits, living in the least-efficient social housing, or referred by a participating local authority or energy supplier and considered vulnerable.The rest of the support will be available for other households in the lower council tax bands A-D – properties ranging from £40,000 to between £68,000 and £88,000 – in England and A-E in Scotland and Wales with an energy performance certificate rating of D-G, as well as low-income households. It includes park homes.The government said the additional 300,000 who could sign up amounted to 2.4 million homes that had already benefited from new energy-efficiency measures under existing support programmes.A separate checker has also been launched for the home upgrade grant, which could help up to 25,000 homes that are off the gas grid and have an energy performance certificate rating of D-G.People can find out if they qualify for energy efficiency support, ranging from insulation and draft proofing to new windows and doors, as well as heat pumps and solar panels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Owned by the billionaire property developer Hui Wing Mau, the aggregation of properties neighbours some of the country’s largest working cattle stations.Abattoirs overwhelmed as farmers offload livestock before big dry beginsRead moreWhile none of the individual properties crack the top 10 in size for Australian cattle stations, when bundled together they cover almost 30,000 sq km – the size of a small European nation.The sale is set to test the market as record rises in farmland prices begin to slow with the approach of an El Niño summer.Managed by specialist commercial real estate agent LAWD, the portfolio includes a herd of up to 50,000 Droughtmaster-Brahman crossbreed cattle. LAWD’s senior director, Danny Thomas, said it was a “rare” opportunity to purchase a cattle business of this size in the Kimberley.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\n“This aggregation is special in that you can breed, background and finish, and the owners have done an excellent job in putting together a significant landholding that can be run as a single entity, including irrigated land to finish stock,” he said.“It is very rare to find a property in the region at this scale that can so easily pivot between live export to the north and the southern markets.”The portfolio has been offered for expressions of interest. The latest Rabobank Australian agricultural land price outlook showed average prices for grazing land in Western Australia reached up to $14,800 a hectare, with an average price of $6,000 a hectare across the state.Hui is the founder and majority owner of the Chinese development company Shimao Group Holdings. Shimao posted a 67% drop in share prices in July after a 16-month trading halt; that same month it was unable to sell off a large project in China and defaulted on a $1bn loan in 2022.Despite Shimao’s losses, Hui was ranked as the 19th richest Australian on the Australian Financial Review’s 2023 rich list, with a fortune of $4.9bn.

        "text": "Researchers at the University of Vienna have discovered particles of plastic in mice’s brains just two hours after the mice ingested drinking water containing plastic.Once in the brain, “Plastic particles could increase the risk of inflammation, neurological disorders or even neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s,” Lukas Kenner, one of the researchers, said in a statement, although more research is needed to determine the relationship between plastics and these brain disorders. In addition to potentially severe degenerative consequences, the researchers also believe that microplastic contamination in our brains can cause short-term health effects such as cognitive impairment, neurotoxicity and altered neurotransmitter levels, which can contribute to behavioral changes.In the course of their research, the team gave mice water laced with particles of polystyrene – a type of plastic that’s common in food packaging such as yoghurt cups and Styrofoam takeout containers.Using computer models to track the dispersion of the plastics, researchers found that nanoplastic particles – which are under 0.001 millimeters and invisible to the naked eye – were able to travel into the mice’s brains via a previously unknown biological “transport mechanism”. Essentially, these tiny plastics are absorbed into cholesterol molecules on the brain membrane surface. Thus stowed away in their little lipid packages, they cross the blood-brain barrier – a wall of blood vessels and tissue that functions to protect the brain from toxins and other harmful substances.While the Vienna study focused on the effects of plastics consumed in drinking water, that’s not the only way humans ingest plastic. A 2022 Chinese study concentrated on how nasally inhaled plastics affect the brain, with researchers reporting “an obvious neurotoxicity of the nanoplastics could be observed”. In basic terms, the inhaled plastics lead to reduced functioning of certain brain enzymes that also malfunction in the brains of patients with Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s.Of course, we eat plastic, too, and new research on plastics and brain health is emerging alongside breaking studies on how the contaminants affect our gastrointestinal health. Much like the blood-brain barrier, the gastrointestinal barrier is also vulnerable to interference by nanoplastics – which can cause inflammatory and immune reactions in the gut, as well as cell death.At this point, it’s clear that plastics have infiltrated most parts of the human body, including our blood, organs, placentas, breast milk and gastrointestinal systems. While we don’t yet fully understand how plastics affect different parts of our bodies, many chemicals found in various types of plastic are known carcinogens and hormone-disruptors, linked to negative health outcomes including obesity, diabetes, reproductive disorders and neurological impairments in foetuses and children.This spring, the Boston College Global Observatory on Planetary Health led the first-ever analysis of the health hazards of plastics across their life cycle and found that “Current patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal are not sustainable and are responsible for significant harms to human health … as well as for deep societal injustices.”None of this is encouraging news – especially in light of the fact that plastic production is still accelerating. Yet, improving our understanding of plastic’s implications for human health is a crucial step towards banning plastic – a move 75% of people globally support. Encouragingly, more than 100 countries have a full or partial ban on single-use plastic bags, and policymakers in some countries are thinking about plastics more in terms of their costly externalities, including pollution and effects on health. Yet global plastics regulation is still vastly out of step with both scientific and public opinion.In 2021, the Canadian government formally classified plastics as toxic under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. The move means that the government has more control over the manufacture and use of plastics, limiting the kinds of exposure that threaten health. In response, plastic producers including Imperial Oil, Dow Chemical and Nova Chemicals formed a coalition to try to crush these regulations.More countries must designate plastics as toxic and increase its regulation, doubling down on the message that when plastic affects our health – even going so far as to alter our brain function – it infringes on our human rights.\nAdrienne Matei is a freelance journalist\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The defense department has only looked at about one-third of more than 700 facilities suspected of having contaminated the ground with PFAS.Drinking water of millions of Americans contaminated with ‘forever chemicals’Read moreWhile the report acknowledges the pollution, it does not clarify which drinking water sources are polluted, how high PFAS levels are in the polluted water systems, or provide information about the plumes’ locations.The sheer number of bases and the lack of clarity is “shocking”, said Scott Faber, the vice-president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group non-profit, which tracks military PFAS pollution.“A good neighbor would let you know that their use of PFAS was the reason your water was contaminated, and a bad neighbor would only tell you: ‘Hey, a plume is heading in your direction,’” Faber said.The defense department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems.They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because most do not degrade in the environment.The military is considered one of the largest PFAS polluters in the world, largely due to its use of firefighting foam laced with the chemicals discharged during emergencies or training exercises. Some of the highest levels of PFAS in groundwater ever detected have been found around bases. The Environmental Protection Agency’s advisory health guidelines state that less than one part per trillion (ppt) in drinking water is safe, while levels found around military bases have exceeded 2.25m ppt.Congress in recent years has included in Defense Authorization Acts requirements for the military to begin investigating PFAS pollution in and around its facilities. The defense department has so far confirmed PFAS contamination at 455 bases, it wrote in the new report, and of that group it has confirmed that 275 out of 295 checked, or about 90%, have plumes “in the proximity” of drinking water supplies.The report does not clarify what “in the proximity” means and does not specify which types of drinking water supplies are threatened. Though it provides a list of bases, public drinking water systems can draw from surface water or community wells, and it is unclear how the plumes may be impacting those pulling water from private wells.“That is what we know so far because that’s all the DoD told us, and it took an act of Congress to get that much information,” Faber said.Though the report does not provide clarity on which communities are drinking contaminated water, the defense department in August issued a separate report revealing that it is now providing clean drinking water to 53 communities.The military currently only provides clean drinking water for communities with levels of PFOA and PFOS, two kinds of PFAS compounds, above 70 ppt. The EPA is proposing lowering the legal limit to 4 ppt. If it does, as expected, the defense department will likely be forced to provide drinking water to most, if not all, communities around facilities where there is PFAS contamination.Even as the military uncovers more PFAS pollution in and around its sites, the amount of spending on remediation of all pollution at its bases is dropping.“Communities around the facilities must be really frustrated because they in all likelihood are drinking from wells that are contaminated by the military, but the DoD is coming up short,” Faber said. “Inevitably we will get answers for these questions as we move through the process.”"

        "text": "Big drinks companies are misleading customers with claims that their plastic water bottles are fully recycled or recyclable, according to consumer groups who have issued a formal complaint to the European Commission.The Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs (BEUC) said claims that water bottles from brands owned by Coca-Cola, Danone and Nestlé are “100% recyclable” or “100% recycled” are misleading because recycling rates are far lower in practice and bottles contain items that cannot be made from recycled material. The consumer rights group, which represents national groups across Europe, also said green imagery on bottles gave the “false idea” of environmental neutrality.There is no guarantee that a plastic water bottle will be recycled, said Ursula Pachl, deputy director general of BEUC. “This greenwashing must stop.”Drink bottles are among the most common forms of plastic polluting European beaches. In a year, the average European drinks around 118 litres of bottled water, according to the BEUC, 97% of which is thought to come in bottles made from plastic.But the amount that gets made into new bottles depends only partly on factors that the company or the customer can control. Other factors include the systems used to collect, sort and recycle the bottles, as well as technical limits and rules around what materials can be used to package food and drink.The BEUC has lodged a complaint with the European Commission over the phrase “100% recyclable” because a consumer cannot assume their water bottle will be recycled. Across the EU, about half of PET bottles are recycled, according to estimates from Zero Waste Europe.The BEUC has also targeted the phrase “100% recycled” because bottle lids in the EU cannot be made of recycled materials. It also said that labels are rarely made from recycled material.Last week, a report from campaign groups ClientEarth, ECOS and Zero Waste Europe found rates of plastic bottle recycling were improving, but that a fully circular system does not exist. “The idea of used bottles simply becoming new bottles over and over again may be appealing to companies and consumers alike, but it does not reflect the outcome for PET-based bottles in Europe,” the authors wrote.The EU has cracked down on greenwashing as corporate sustainability claims have grown. In September, the European parliament and council agreed on new advertising rules banning generic sustainability claims like “climate neutral”, “natural” and “eco” unless backed up by proof of excellent environmental performance.There is a lot of concern about plastic pollution and a lot of confusion about recycling, said Rosa Pritchard, a lawyer with ClientEarth, which supported the BEUC challenge. “Consumers are just tired of greenwashing, generally, and really want information they can count on.”The BEUC has the power to issue external alerts – formal complaints about suspicious business practices – to the commission and the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network. The commission cannot fine traders who are found to have breached advertising rules but national authorities from EU member states may choose to do so.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We’re working to reduce the amount of plastic packaging we use, and we’re investing to collect and recycle the equivalent of the packaging we use.

If global heating rises to 2C above pre-industrial levels, similar heatwaves will be expected every five or six years. The world has now heated by about 1.2C.Lincoln Muniz Alves, a researcher at the Brazil National Institute for Space Research, said the main message was that human rather than natural factors were behind the extremes. “We want to be clear: a developing El Niño would have contributed some heat, but without climate change, spring heat this intense would have been extremely unlikely,” he said.Millions of people have been affected as Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay have sweltered in spring temperatures where national maximums have risen above 40C. The impact is still being measured. Four heat-related deaths were reported in São Paulo, which registered 37C, according to the scientists, though they say the true toll will probably not be known for several months.This followed a warm winter in many parts of South America. In Argentina, the weather bureau described the situation as “off-the-scale” after the hottest start to August in 117 years.Outside the area of the study, meteorologists have expressed horror at the brutal extremes that have continued until today in some places.To the west in the high Andes mountains of Chile, monitoring stations measured heat of 37C in August, melting the snow below 3,000 metres (9,840ft), which has a knock-on effect for downstream valley residents who depend on meltwater during the summer.To the north, many areas of the Amazon rainforest are suffering a harder dry season than usual. At least 139 endangered river dolphins have died at Lake Tefé, which resembles a hot bath after a protracted drought dried up most of the water. The human signal in this case is less clear.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

All showed a strong human fingerprint.The team of researchers urged policymakers across the world to strengthen social resilience to the heat, but they said the most important countermeasure was to address the root cause of human greenhouse gases.“We’re now experiencing more and more dangerously hot days each year,” said Izidine Pinto, a researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. “Unless we take ambitious action to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, springtime heat will only become more intense, affecting vulnerable people and disrupting ecosystems that are vital for regulating our climate.”"

Given the increased demand they are now booked out until February.Australia’s biggest abattoir in Ipswich last month announced that it would implement a “second shift” at the facility by the start of next year, adding an extra 500 jobs to meet demand.A Meat and Livestock Australia analyst, Ripley Atkinson, who has noticed delays “from a month onwards”, said a lag in getting livestock to market could affect their price and put additional pressures on producers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Dig up your “imperial” lawn and replant it with trees to combat the climate crisis, researchers have urged, after the latest study to lay bare the emissions cost of maintaining that pleasant, green patch.If a third of the world’s city lawns were planted with trees, more than a gigatonne of carbon could be removed from the atmosphere over two decades, researchers from Auckland University of Technology found. The problem is not the grass itself, but the mowing, fertilisation and irrigation required.The researchers reviewed 65 studies of emissions and sequestration of carbon by turf or lawn compared with trees. They concluded that, globally, the equivalent of 157 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per hectare could be avoided, and up to 1,630m tonnes of carbon absorbed from the atmosphere over 20 years if a third of mown grass in cities were planted with trees.Turf wars: the artists who want to mow down the menace of lawnsRead moreThe traditional lawn – a uniform, trimmed carpet of ryegrass – has been under fire for years because of its lack of biodiversity and voracious appetite for fertiliser, herbicides and mowing.As climate breakdown drives more extreme weather, droughts have highlighted the irrigation demands of velvety turf. In response, anti-lawn and “rewilding” movements have seeded across the UK, with advocates pushing to replace the lawn with trees, shrubs or a more diverse mixture of unmown wildflowers and native grasses. In 2021, 30 UK councils adopted “No mow May” to encourage wildflower growth and natural pollinators.The research’s lead author, Prof Len Gillman, said that while abandoning the mower and letting a lawn go wild “might cut down on the emissions due to maintenance, it’s not going far enough”.“In terms of climate change we need to absorb as much carbon as we possibly can from the atmosphere …. The biggest difference is that shrubs and trees will store vastly more carbon than a lawn.”In countries such as Australia, New Zealand and the US, the lawn represented a throwback to the colonial era, Gillman said, when lawns were strongly associated with affluence and nostalgia for English landscapes. Now, “a lot of lawns almost happen by mistake, as a default setting”, he said.Expanding urban forests and tree numbers had other benefits too, Gillman said. Trees could cool the atmosphere in increasingly overheated cities, and were associated with benefits to health and wellbeing.Previous studies have found that lawns occupy 50-70% of the green open spaces in the world’s cities, and almost 2% of the total area of the US.The research was published in the January 2023 journal of Global Sustainability by Cambridge University Press."

        "text": "Ministers have warned energy firms that they must pass on the benefits of lower wholesale prices to consumers, amid concern that bills could rise this spring.In a speech on Wednesday, Grant Shapps will tell energy suppliers that reduced wholesale prices must be seen in consumer prices, “no ifs, buts or maybes”.In an apparent sign of government concern about the impact of reduced direct support for domestic energy bills, the energy secretary will spell out his message in a speech at the Chatham House thinktank in London.“I have one overriding mission in this new job: for the UK to have amongst the cheapest wholesale electricity prices in Europe,” said Shapps, whose formal brief changed from being business and energy secretary to energy security and net –zero secretary amid a mini-reshuffle and restructuring earlier in February.“This is critical to consumers, to our country and to our planet,” he added. “Making the most of our position as a world-leaders in renewables and nuclear technology, homegrown sources that will shield households from the worst excesses of the volatile global fossil-fuel markets. And suppliers must be ready to pass those savings on to consumers.”Ministers face pressure to postpone the reduction in support for consumer energy bills due in April, given the impact on cost of living pressures.On Monday, the energy regulator, Ofgem, said its energy cap – the amount suppliers can charge for average dual fuel, direct debit customers – would fall by 23% for the three months from 1 April to £3,280, from £4,279 for the January to March quarter.However, the reduction in government help means that the actual price paid by an average household will rise from £2,100 a year in April to £3,000.Wholesale gas prices have fallen sharply in recent months but the drop is yet to feed through into household bills because suppliers buy their energy months in advance.Shapps’ speech, extracts of which were released in advance by his department, will also focus on wider energy security issues, with a pledge that “never again should [Vladimir] Putin or anyone like him even think they can hold the UK to ransom”.The government has promised to invest heavily in domestic-based energy sources, including nuclear power, renewables and some continued fossil fuel extraction.The latter has prompted protest groups to vow to obstruct this, with Shapps due to also promise action to tackle them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Thames Water is on the brink of collapse, with emergency plans being drawn up to take the company into temporary public ownership. It’s an extraordinary state of affairs: how could a business with a regional monopoly over an essential service not manage to maintain a financially sustainable footing? The answer: an extractive ownership model has seen the company loaded with debt, and returns for its investors prioritised over the needs of both people and the environment. As interest rates have risen sharply over recent months, this inherently precarious business model has come under acute and seemingly fatal pressure.The story of Thames Water is emblematic of wider failures of privatisation. Since the late 1980s, water companies in England and Wales have paid out £72bn to shareholders. To help pay for this generosity, the water companies – which were sold off without debts – have borrowed on an exceptional scale, accumulating a debt pile of £53bn.What has this meant for customers? In real terms, bills have increased by around 40% since privatisation, yet investment by the companies has gone down by 15%. The consequences are glaringly evident: up to 2.4bn litres of water a day (equivalent to nearly 1000 Olympic swimming pools) are leaked by English water companies. Every day, raw sewage is discharged into our rivers and seas more than 1000 times on average, for a total of over 9m hours since 2016. With this scale of neglect, it’s hardly shocking that just 14% of English rivers have adequate ecological status.Who, then, benefits from this model, if neither people nor planet? International investors, for one. Indeed, over 70% of English water companies’ value is foreign owned. Thames Water, specifically, counts among its top investors a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi investment authority, the China Investment Corporation, and two Canadian public sector funds. The Universities Superannuation Scheme, too, has a sizeable stake, in a paradoxical relationship that sees a vital service many beneficiaries of that scheme may use, faltering under the strain of demand for high returns for a pensions system equally under pressure. Neither can we forget the perks for water executives: the outgoing CEO of United Utilities, the UK’s most polluting water company, made an impressive £1.4m this year by selling his shares before his retirement.It’s a self-defeating arrangement in which England and Wales are global outliers: indeed, they are globally exceptional in having wholly privatised water systems. There is a simple reason for this. Internationally, water is seen as a less attractive prospect for private investors relative to other infrastructure sectors, not least because the essential nature of the service means that operators cannot cut off provision in the event of non-payment. To compensate, government policy has actively made the sector a more attractive investment proposition through an accommodating regulatory regime and by, for example, making it relatively easier to increase tariffs.Thankfully, there is a wealth of alternative models from which we can draw inspiration. Across Europe, the norm is for water infrastructure and services to be in public hands, owned and successfully operated for the public interest. Nor do we have to look as far as the continent: we have a readymade comparison in Scotland, which effectively resisted the privatisation of Scottish Water. The contrast between the two is stark: users in the rest of the UK spent an estimated 10% more on water bills than those in Scotland, and the publicly owned company invested 35% more per household per year than private firms in England.What lessons can we draw from this story? That water privatisation has been an unvarnished success in only one way: the enrichment of its overseas shareholders and executives. With Thames Water possibly following on the heels of Bulb’s emergency nationalisation, we should expect the failure of highly indebted, privatised utilities to accelerate. And perhaps above all, the simple lesson that almost every country in the world has learned: that for something as fundamental and so ill-suited to competition as water, public ownership for the public benefit is the only acceptable approach.\nMathew Lawrence is director of Common Wealth and co-author of Owning the Future with Adrienne Buller\n"

        "text": "This week science lost one of its greatest Earth system experts, Australia lost a skilled, passionate communicator of climate science and the world lost a humble soul of the highest humanity, kindness and integrity. As did scores of others, I lost a colleague and friend when Will Steffen left us on Sunday after a battle with pancreatic cancer.It is impossible to overstate Will’s impact on science. The many tributes to his work can only scratch the surface of his legacy. He led the effort to map the Great Acceleration of human impact on the physical and biological systems of our planet, culminating in consideration of the geological age of humans – the Anthropocene, first proposed by Nobel prize winner Paul Crutzen.Will Steffen, ‘courageous’ climate scientist, dies in Canberra aged 75Read moreWith colleagues, Will catalogued Earth’s tipping elements and their alarming trend of moving to transgress boundary conditions beyond which human ability to slow climate change would be ineffectual. He built the scientific case for Planetary Boundaries with Johan Rockström. For decades Will led vast international research teams, trained students, mentored colleagues, advised governments and courts, communicated clearly to civil society, wrote innumerable reports and connected with those at the coal face of climate change. He dared to ask the question: “Where on Earth are we going?”I am filled with grief at losing Will at a time when we need his calm, direct voice more than ever. It is natural that I’m angry and fearful, emotions born of grief. But my emotions stem not only from the grief of losing Will but also from grief over what we have already lost to insufficient action on climate change, and what we stand to lose if we continue on the path of tepid and ineffectual posturing, greenwashing and half measures.I’m angry about the same things that made Will angry. And fearful of the same things that made him apprehensive.These are Will’s words in 2020 when asked what he felt when thinking about climate change:\nAs the climate system continues to spiral towards a potentially uncontrollable state, I am struck with an increasing sense of both anger and apprehension. I’m angry because the lack of effective action on climate change, despite the wealth not of only scientific information but also of solutions to reduce emissions, has now created a climate emergency. The students are right. Their future is now being threatened by the greed of the wealthy fossil fuel elite, the lies of the Murdoch press, and the weakness of our political leaders. These people have no right to destroy my daughter’s future and that of her generation.I’m apprehensive because the more we learn about climate change, the riskier it looks. Even at a 1 degree C rise in global temperature, extreme weather events are becoming more violent and dangerous than models have predicted. Over the last 5 years, our knowledge of tipping points in the Earth System has advanced rapidly, with many already showing signs of instability. Worse yet, they can interact like a row of dominoes to set off a tipping cascade, driving the Earth to hotter and more unstable conditions. That is my worst fear – that we may reach a ‘point of no return’ where we commit our children to a future of hell on Earth.\nYou would have been unlikely to directly experience Will’s anger and fears about climate change and environmental destruction because he transformed those emotions into constructive research, communication and, most of all, personal and collective action.Let part of his enormous legacy be that we do the same, with the same clarity of purpose, determination and humanity that Will displayed. Let that be how we honour and offer our gratitude to my dear friend Will Steffen, an incomparable champion for planet Earth and all that is nurtured by it. Dr Penny D Sackett is a distinguished honorary professor at the Australian National University Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions and a former chief scientist for Australia. As members of the Australian Capital Territory’s Climate Change Council, she and Steffen collaborated to produce scientific targets for emissions reduction in the ACT, which were adopted by the territory government"

        "text": "Record-breaking land and sea temperatures, driven by climate breakdown, will probably cause “unprecedented mass coral bleaching and mortality” throughout 2024, according to a pioneering coral scientist.The impact of climate change on coral reefs has reached “uncharted territory”, said Prof Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, from the University of Queensland, Australia, leading to concerns that we could be at a “tipping point”.The upper ocean is undergoing unmatched changes in conditions, ecosystems and communities that can be traced back to the 1980s, when mass coral bleaching first appeared. In a paper published in the journal Science, US and Australian researchers say that historical data on sea surface temperatures, over four decades, suggests that this year’s extreme marine heatwaves may be a precursor to a mass bleaching and coral mortality event across the Indo-Pacific in 2024-25.Mass coral bleaching happens when delicate corals become stressed due to factors including heat, causing them to lose their brown microbial algae, turning them white. At low stress levels, the algae can return to corals over a few months. But many Caribbean reef areas have recently experienced historically high sea temperatures that began one or two months earlier and lasted longer than usual.Crucially, 2023 is the first year of a potential pair of El Niño years, with the warmest average global surface sea temperature from February to July on record. Since 1997, every instance of these El Niño pairs has led to a global mass coral bleaching event.Hoegh-Guldberg, whose work has helped to shape the world’s understanding of the risks to the ocean’s richest ecosystems, said: “The probability is that somewhere in the next 12 to 24 months, we are going see El Niño combine with warming sea temperatures and have a really big impact.“We are literally in uncharted territory, which we know very little about and don’t know how to respond to and I think we’re dangerously exposed.”“We don’t know the implications of such a spike in temperature,” said the scientist, speaking from Dubai, where he is attending the Cop28 climate summit. “We may see storms that are even larger than the ones we’ve been seeing. These are the warmest temperatures ever on land and sea.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We don’t know the implications of such a spike in temperature.”Mass bleaching and mortality of coral events in the Indo-Pacific, which will lead to long-term damage to ecosystems and the millions of people in the Earth’s tropical regions who depend on them, could worsen unless greenhouse gas emissions decrease, he said.The tiny brown algae that live in coral are very sensitive to temperature changes. “Just like us, as humans, there’s a set temperature at which we feel fine. But then one or two temperatures above that, and you’re dead. This is at a planetary scale. It’s a shocker.”The earth experienced its warmest day since 1910 in July 2023, as well as its warmest month for upper sea temperatures.Hoegh-Guldberg said: “What we do know, from 40 years of history, is that there’s a very strong, tight connection between this amount of energy in the system and the violence of storms and the impacts on biological systems. That is very well established.”As coral reefs bleach and die, the habitats on which many associated reef species depend disappears, leading to ecosystem collapse. This could undermine as much as 25% of ocean biodiversity, the researchers say.He urged policymakers and world leaders to “move faster and with more determination than ever before” to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to “trust the science” to guide us.“This is a science-based engineering problem,” said Hoegh-Guldberg. “We need to set the parameters. We need to define the way our planet works and do it in record time. Because we’ve got resources, we can do it. But we’ve got to be smart and involve everyone. And make sure that we get a system that’s going to cool the planet for a while, or at least not increase for a while.”"

Since the day my ancestors first stepped ashore, our islands have been devastated by hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes and erupting volcanoes that buried whole towns.But fires are something new. We were not prepared. Our officials were not prepared, for a raging inferno of 1,000-degree heat that moved at lightning speed, reducing our historical town of Lahaina – once the capital of the Hawaiian kingdom – and 2,000 homes to ash. More than 1,300 people are still missing. At this stage, many will not be found. Cadaver dogs whine with frustration. They are uncovering mostly ash.How did this happen? We need somewhere to place the blame. Herman Andaya, head of the Maui Emergency Management Agency, has publicly stated that emergency sirens were intentionally not activated because they are used for tsunami warnings. He feared that people, hearing the sirens, would run the wrong way, into the oncoming fires. This decision is not only the apotheosis of stupidity. It feels criminal. He has already resigned. Massive lawsuits are being brought against Mema. But how to compensate for the loss of lives, the indelible image of families locked in melting cars?‘Coral are going to die’: Maui wildfires take toxic toll on marine ecologyRead moreStill, there is something larger to consider here. The sirens would have alerted people, they might have saved innumerable lives, but they would not have stopped the raging fire itself that leveled Lahaina. Beyond Mema and the agency’s unfathomable decision, a lethal combination of prolonged drought, parched grasslands and hurricane-force winds were what destroyed the town.Hawaii will never recover from this loss. Nor will other Pacific peoples. Across our Oceanic continent, rainfall is decreasing drastically. Island droughts are becoming extreme as global temperatures continue to rise. Strong winds will create more catastrophic fires, as we have already witnessed in Papua New Guinea, parts of Australia and New Zealand, and in smaller landmasses in French Polynesia and Samoa.I want to talk about greed – about global nuclear weapons testing, chemical corporations, oil drilling, big pharma. But I fear it’s too late. I have little hope that our planet can recover. Parts of Europe are in flames. Towns in Norway are flooding from torrential rains. Canada is ablaze, an entire city evacuating. Amid the mass genocide in Darfur, the ground is barren, once-fertile fields have gone to dust. There is no food for fleeing refugees.On good days I remind myself that Hawaiians were among Earth’s first celestial navigators – its naked-eye astronomers – who valiantly crossed the vast Pacific in search of new and fertile islands. On darker days I contemplate our islands – fragile dots on the planet facing imminent extinction.\nKiana Davenport is a writer of Native-Hawaiian and Anglo-American descent.

        "text": "Libyan authorities have largely sealed off the flood-devastated port town of Derna from civilians in an effort to give space to emergency aid workers and amid concern that contamination of standing water may add to the already horrific death toll.Salem Al-Ferjani, director general of the ambulance and emergency service in eastern Libya, said that only search and rescue teams would be allowed to enter parts of the town most affected by the flooding that has left at least 11,000 dead according to official projections. Many citizens have already left the town voluntarily.The plan to shut off the town came after the Libyan Red Crescent raised its estimate of the number of dead and missing. The UN has launched an appeal for $71m and said 884,000 people had been affected by the floods that hit north-east Libya early on Sunday morning.“Bodies are littering the streets, washing back on shore and are buried under collapsed buildings and debris. In just two hours, one of my colleagues counted over 200 bodies on the beach near Derna,” Bilal Sablouh, the ICRC’s regional forensics manager for Africa, told a briefing in Geneva. Divers are also combing the coastal waters of the city.The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Committee of the Red Cross on Friday issued a joint statement urging Libyans to stop burying the dead in mass graves.Libya and Morocco: two very different responses to catastropheRead more“Some may move quickly to bury bodies, such as in mass graves, in part in an attempt to manage this distress, and sometimes because of the fear that these bodies pose a health threat,” the statement said.“This approach can be detrimental to the population. Though local authorities and communities can be under immense pressure to bury the dead quickly, the consequences of mismanagement of the dead include long-lasting mental distress for family members as well as social and legal problems”.Pierre Guyomarch, the head of the ICRC’s forensics unit, said: “The belief that dead bodies will cause epidemics is not supported by evidence. We see too many cases where media reports and even some medical professionals get this issue wrong. Those who survive an event like a natural disaster are more likely to spread disease than dead bodies.”The exception was where bodies were in or near fresh water supplies, underlining the need for fresh water. Libyan health authorities have reported more than 40 cases of water poisoning.A UN report showed that more than 1,000 people had so far been buried in that manner since the country was hit by floods.The part closure of the town has done nothing to stave off the growing anger at the way politicians have handled the crisis, by issuing unclear evacuation orders before the floods and by failing to do anything to siphon water off the two dams, as had been done before.A multi-year failure to maintain the dam is being put down to negligence and a €100m compensation demand made by a Turkish firm that was originally contracted to maintain the Derna valley dams.Many Libyans were calling for any official inquiry into the causes of the disaster to have an international component to prevent a cover-up.Elham Saudi, the director of Lawyers for Justice in Libya, said: “An international inquiry is required to investigate and hold accountable those responsible, whether through negligence or corruption, for this tragedy. One thing we have learnt is that the political elite in Libya are incapable and unwilling to hold themselves to account.“We have seen this in action on several occasions in recent days including [speaker of the House of Representatives] Aguila Saleh telling Libyans ‘don’t say if we had done this or that … this is a natural disaster’ in his first address to the nation since the floods. Impunity can longer be the norm in Libya and we certainly know from our research and the public outcry that we Libyans will no longer tolerate it.”In a sign of how militias still dominate in the town, a coordination meeting was held on Thursday in Derna between representatives of the Tariq bin Ziyad Brigade, 444th Brigade, 166th Battalion, and other brigades accused of trying to take control of aid distribution.Libyan TV stations have come together to start an appeal for the region and Friday prayers were devoted to those affected."

Pollution, boat strikes and rising sea temperatures are further human-caused risks to marine mammals.UK fishing vessels ‘underreporting’ whale, dolphin and porpoise bycatchRead moreThe report called for better monitoring of bycatch. Estimates suggest 650,000 marine mammals are killed each year in fishing nets, but experts think the number could be significantly higher because of a lack of reporting. Suggested ways of reducing bycatch include using cameras or observers on ships. The committee is calling for an action plan, with targets and milestones, by December.Sir Robert Goodwill, the Conservative MP who is chair of the committee, said: “We are rightly appalled when magnificent whales or defenceless seals are deliberately slaughtered. We can and should do more to stop this as we sign new post-Brexit trade deals worldwide.“But snarling these beautiful creatures in fishing gear wreaks a far greater toll. Starting with the biggest boats, then moving to the smallest – giving the small operators time to adjust – we must stop this industrial-scale killing. We owe it to our generations to come.”MPs pointed out that other countries have higher protections for marine mammals, and highlighted the 1972 US Marine Mammal Protection Act. They said the government should bring in primary legislation to protect seals and cetaceans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The sound of babbling water and birdsong provides a pleasing soundtrack.The Guardian view on beavers: a spur to hope for nature’s recovery | EditorialRead moreA new online tour was launched on Thursday of an enclosure on the Holnicote estate in Somerset that is home to a family of five beavers. In what is billed as the first of its kind, the tour allows viewers to navigate through the 2.7-acre Exmoor enclosure where two adult beavers and their three offspring live and work.So far, there is four minutes of footage available but as the National Trust project continues, the idea is to add more.Other wildlife captured include kingfishers, stoat,s roe deer and bull finches, all of which are believed to have benefited from the changes the beavers – nature’s engineers – are making to the area.Ben Eardley, the project manager for the National Trust at Holnicote, said: “We wanted to find a way of sharing their antics and to enable people to find out more about these shy species. Web users can explore beaver-constructed dams, ponds, canals and wetlands and see and hear some of the wildlife the habitat supports.”A camera used to film the virtual tour of the beavers’ enclosure. Photograph: National Trust ImagesThe two adult beavers were released three years ago with a key aim of slowing the flow of water through the landscape to reduce flooding, as well as to help hold water in the landscape in times of drought and improve river quality and biodiversity.Eardley said: “They have built dams and created deep pools of water which offer shelter from predators and places to access and store food. This has, in turn, developed habitat that suits a host of wildlife such as amphibians, bats, mammals such as otter, and birds such as kingfisher, dippers and waterfowl. It’s also turned the surrounding land into a mosaic of nature-rich rare habitat, including wetland and standing deadwood.”Two of the kits on the Holnicote estate in Somerset. Photograph: National Trust ImagesThe pair, Grylls and Yogi, have had three kits, Rashford, Russo and Toone (named after footballers), their births a sign of how well the beavers have settled in.“The beavers have constructed a large lodge in which they spend the day before venturing out at dusk to get busy feeding and constructing more wildlife-rich wetland,” said Eardley.One of the beavers swimming at dusk in an extensive beaver pond constructed in a large woodland enclosure at Holnicote.

They are known as “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and they have been linked to cancer, high cholesterol, liver and kidney disease, fetal complications and other serious health problems in humans.The chemicals are thought to be polluting drinking water for more than 200 million people, and the study is the second this year to suggest widespread contamination of freshwater US fish.The independent studies and research from state and federal regulators have shed light on a potential health threat in Michigan and nationally that public health advocates say needs urgent attention.The findings are “sad”, said Erica Bloom, one of the study’s co-authors with the Ecology Center, an environmental non-profit that tracks PFAS contamination in the state.“It just demonstrates how ubiquitous these chemicals are in the environment,” she said.The levels found in fish sampled from those rivers ranged from about 11,000 parts per trillion (ppt) to 180,000 ppt, and tests revealed 14 different kinds of PFAS compounds.While no state or federal limits on the amount of PFAS in fish or other food exist, Michigan’s health department issues “do not eat” advisories for fish fillets with levels over 300,000 ppt of PFOS, just one kind of PFAS compound. Fillets typically have lower levels of PFAS than the organs, which were included in Ecology Center’s testing.However, recent research showed how the nation’s freshwater fish can represent a dangerous exposure route even at levels below the state’s threshold. Eating a fish fillet with 11,800 ppt of PFOS is equivalent to drinking water contaminated with PFOS at 48 ppt every day for a month.The situation presents not just an environmental safety issue to those who fish in rivers as a hobby but an environmental justice issue as it is lower income residents who most frequently rely on eating fish they catch from freshwater rivers, as well as groups that fish as a cultural practice. The Ecology Center worked with about a dozen local anglers who caught the fish that were sampled.“Fishing in these rivers is an important way of life, and we’re not out here to tell people to stop fishing – but if you’re fishing, here are some things to look out for,” Bloom said.She said it is up to state regulators to protect anglers, and the results highlight how agencies are failing to keep pace with new science and regulations around PFAS. Michigan’s 300,000 ppt “do not eat” level for PFOS was based off outdated science from the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).The EPA last year lowered its health advisory limit on PFOS in drinking water after it found virtually no exposure level is safe. Michigan has yet to adjust its fish advisory accordingly, and doing so would dramatically lower the “do not eat” threshold.Bloom said it is unclear why state regulators have not updated their advisories, and added that fish consumption levels in Michigan “should be reviewed and lowered”.“Fish advisories need to be as protective as possible to keep pace with what’s happening with emerging science at the federal level,” Bloom said."

He said the “groundbreaking” investment marked “a significant step in our rollout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the country”.“This is the biggest private investment in electric charging in the UK and is a huge vote of confidence in Britain’s role as a leader in green industries,” Hunt said.Andrew Cole, a director at the NEC Group, said the conference centre’s campus, which has 7 million visitors a year, could now charge about 1,000 electric cars in every 12-hour day.The “Gigahub” was developed between the NEC, independent charging infrastructure company EV Network and BP Pulse, which operates the site.Akira Kirton, the vice-president of BP Pulse UK, said the company, which is owned by the oil company BP, would invest up to £1bn to accelerate the development of the UK’s EV infrastructure by delivering “the right charging speeds, in the right locations”.“We plan to roll out hundreds of hubs this decade in places EV drivers needs them – urban areas, on trunk roads and motorways and at destinations such as restaurants, retail parks and hotels,” he said.Reza Shaybani, the co-founder and chief executive of EV Network, warned that the UK’s existing grid infrastructure was “a key bottleneck in developing future robust infrastructure for fast charging”.“This is why sites like [the Birmingham NEC] are all about the grid connection and their vicinity to electrical infrastructure,” he said.“We’re envisaging a situation where 30 cars turn up at the same time and draw maximum power. The site is designed in such a way that if all the sockets are in use at the same time the grid can cope with providing enough power for everybody.” This article was amended on 8 September 2023.

        "text": "The RSPB is calling for a moratorium on the release of game birds this summer to keep avian flu levels down.The charity says it will be catastrophic for tens of millions of game birds such as pheasants and partridges to be released in late June and July for shooting in the summer and autumn with avian flu still a huge threat to wild birds.There have been 10 outbreaks of avian flu at game-bird rearing premises since 2021. The most recent was in April at Bettws Hall Game Farm, a major facility near Newtown in Powys where protection zones are still in place.Game birds are held in captivity in the UK before they are released for the shooting season. The Animal and Plant Health Agency classifies the birds as poultry while in captivity, but once released they are classed as wild birds for avian flu rules, and their breeder or owner is no longer their legal keeper.About 55 million pheasants and red-legged partridges and 2.6 million mallards are reared in captivity each year for release into the countryside to be shot for sport. Bird releases start towards the end of June and continue through July and August, but before then they can be moved from farms to release pens which are often unroofed. This can lead to interactions with wild birds, putting them at risk, the RSPB says.The Welsh government’s chief veterinary officer, Dr Richard Irvine, announced the latest protection zone around Bettws Hall Game Farm on 27 April. Under the declaration game birds are not allowed to be released.The chair of the National Farmers Union in Montgomeryshire, Richard Jones, said it must be enforced and that no birds should released from the farm this season.He said releases would put thousands of birds, including poultry, at risk. Jones, whose farm is within the six-mile (10km) protection zone around Bettws Hall, still has to keep his poultry, which is supposed to be free range, indoors.He is awaiting the arrival of 21,000 new birds at the beginning of June. “The release of pheasants and game birds will hugely increase the risk to my birds. Once they are released, they are wild birds and will mix with other wild birds with avian flu. It will become a humungous problem. Meanwhile we are not allowed to release our birds outdoors because we are in the restriction zone.”The RSPB says there should be a ban on bird releases to stop the catastrophic spread of avian flu. The charity said it was not clear how many pheasants and other game birds were tested for diseases before being released for the shooting season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "A third of the companies most linked to the destruction of tropical rainforests have not set a single policy on deforestation, a report reveals.Research by Global Canopy has found that 31% of the companies with the greatest influence on tropical deforestation risk through their supply chains do not have a single deforestation commitment for any of the commodities to which they are exposed.Many of those who have set policies are not monitoring them correctly, meaning deforestation to produce their commodities could still be taking place. Of the 100 companies with a deforestation commitment for every commodity to which they are exposed, only 50% are monitoring their suppliers or sourcing regions in line with their deforestation commitments for every commodity.Global Canopy’s Forest 500 report states: “We are three years past the 2020 deadline that many organisations set themselves to halt deforestation, and just two years away from the UN’s deadline of 2025 for companies and financial institutions to eliminate commodity-driven deforestation, conversion and the associated human rights abuses. This target date is essential to meeting our global net zero targets and averting catastrophic climate change.”At Cop26 in 2021, world leaders agreed to remove deforestation from supply chains. Land-clearing by humans accounts for almost a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, largely deriving from the destruction of the world’s forests for agricultural products such as palm oil, soy and beef.Financial institutions have a poor record on deforestation, according to the report. Those identified provide US$6.1tn in finance to companies in forest-risk supply chains, but according to the report “only a small proportion of financial institutions most exposed to deforestation are addressing deforestation as a systemic risk”.Ninety-two (61%) of the financial institutions that are most exposed to deforestation do not have a deforestation policy covering their lending and investments, and only 48 (32%) financial institutions have publicly recognised deforestation as a business risk.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Fourteen Greenpeace activists have been held for more than 48 hours after trespassing into and occupying a liquid natural gas (LNG) terminal in Zeebrugge, BelgiumGreenpeace Belgium said it was working for their release. Valerie Del Re, director of Greenpeace Belgium, said: “It’s not our activists, but gas companies like Fluxys who are the criminals in this story.“They continue to invest in new fossil gas infrastructure, which is a disaster for human rights and for the climate. It is impossible to understand why environmental activists would be detained for so long.”On Saturday morning, activists from Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK sailed inflatables into the terminal, operated by Fluxys, a Belgium LNG transportation company.They climbed on to the quays used for loading and unloading LNG tankers and displayed a banner reading “Gas kills” while others entered on kayaks. They maintained the occupation for six hours before they were removed by police.Greenpeace activists climb up a gas pipeline structure at the Fluxys liquid gas terminal. Photograph: Nicolas Maeterlinck/Belga/AFP/Getty ImagesDel Re added: “Our non-violent actions of civil disobedience always follow the rule of do-no-harm. They are a legitimate means of opposing practices that threaten all of us.“We applaud the courage of our activists and we are doing all we can to help them in these difficult times.”Greenpeace said the action was to raise awareness of the role of gas operators such as Fluxys in the massive increase in LNG imports to Europe from the US. The environmental protest organisation said it was calling for all new gas infrastructure to be stopped and for a European plan to phase out gas by 2035.According to research by Greenpeace, Europe increased its imports of LNG from the US by 140% in 2022, since the beginning of the war in Ukraine. Eight new LNG terminals are under construction in the European Union, and plans for a further 38 are under consideration, the group said.Greenpeace’s latest protest comes as climate activist groups have been staging road block protests all over Europe. Just Stop Oil sister groups, all funded by the same US philanthropists, the Climate Emergency Fund, now operate in 11 countries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "When Kevin Jordan bought his seaside home in Hemsby, Norfolk, he was told it would be safe for a century. In the decade since, 17 of his neighbours’ homes have had to be demolished, or have been swept away into the waters of the North Sea. His is now just 5 metres from the fast-crumbling cliff, isolated and unreachable by car after part of the road collapsed into the North Sea.The people of Hemsby would seem to be natural beneficiaries of official policies to adapt to the climate crisis. Under the Climate Change Act 2008, the government is required to produce a national adaptation programme every five years, setting out plans protect communities in the UK from the extreme heat, flooding and coastal erosion expected as the climate breaks down.But critics, including the government’s own advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), have said it is not doing enough. And now, in a case believed to be the first of its kind, Jordan is taking the government to court, alleging its failure to set out lawful “adaptation objectives” in its latest plan is a breach of his human rights.“The collapse of the road made so many more things a struggle,” Jordan said. “From emergency services to bin collections, grocery shopping and even the post, it’s been one thing after another. It feels like we’re being forgotten up here.”In a care home 200 miles away, in Wetherby, West Yorkshire, lives Doug Paulley, a co-claimant in the case. He lives with a number of long-term conditions that make him particularly susceptible to overheating, including autonomic dysfunction, which has contributed to several strokes, as well as diabetes and a heart condition.“During last year’s heatwaves in the UK, I practically had to hibernate to get through it, and couldn’t venture outside,” said Paulley. According to the Health Security Agency 2,803 excess deaths occurred during the summer of 2022. Those with medical conditions, older people and very young children were especially at risk.But the adaptation plan fails to set out a cross-sector approach to addressing heat-related risks to the social care sector, nor does it provide dedicated long-term funding to retrofit care homes with insulation and cooling measures.“Even when temperatures are in the minuses, I’m most comfortable wearing just a T-shirt and trousers – that should give an idea of how much I struggle with heat intolerance,” he said. “With the world only getting hotter, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for someone with my complex health needs to cope.”The latest national adaptation programme (NAP3) was published in July, four months after the CCC warned MPs in a report to parliament that its predecessor plan, NAP2, included credible plans for only five of the 45 adaptation areas.Jordan and Paulley’s legal challenge, supported by Friends of the Earth, argues that NAP3 continues to fall short. They say it breaches the Climate Change Act by failing to set out lawful “adaptation objectives”, and by failing to consider and publish an assessment of the risks to delivery of the plans and policies included.In a case that is believed to be the first to challenge UK climate adaptation plans, they also ask the court to rule that the deficiencies in the national plan breach Jordan and Paulley’s human rights by failing to protect their lives, homes and property from foreseeable impacts of the climate crisis.Friends of the Earth also believes that the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) failed to lawfully assess the unequal impacts of the NAP3 on protected groups under the Equality Act 2010, in line with the “public sector equality duty”.The claimants have already written to the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, to raise their concerns. But her department denied any wrongdoing and refused to disclose key documents. On 17 October, the claimants filed their case at the high court.Will Rundle, the head of legal at Friends of the Earth, said: “This year has set a string of new global temperature records which have driven deadly heatwaves and wildfires across the world, and last July the UK exceeded 40C for the first time ever.“We need our government to take urgent action to curb emissions and put in place credible plans to keep us safe from the extreme weather and impacts of climate change already devastating people’s lives. But the government’s latest adaptation plan continues to fall far short of what’s needed – and comes amid backtracking on the green policies needed to tackle climate change.“Our co-claimants are among those most at risk from the climate crisis. We hope this case will lead to more ambitious and effective adaptation plans that better protect everyone, especially those who are already being hardest hit by climate breakdown.”The Guardian has contacted Defra for comment."

        "text": "A train carrying hazardous materials derailed in North Dakota late on Sunday night in the latest toxic railway accident to hit the US.The incident happened less than two months after a train derailed near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border, causing a raging fire and leaking cancerous chemicals near the small town of East Palestine.Two trains derail in Washington and Arizona amid rising rail safety concernsRead moreThe incident on Sunday involved a Canadian Pacific freight train that derailed around 11.15pm, according to initial reports, affecting 31 of the train’s 70 cars. Spilled cargo from the derailment included petroleum used to make asphalt.Emergency response personnel and hazmat experts were at the crash scene, in a rural area of Richland county, on Monday morning. There was no fire and the spill occurred in a cold and snowy area, minimizing the threat to public safety, according to the rail company.Officials will allow the spilled materials to freeze in order to aid the cleanup, which is expected to take seven to 10 days.The derailment in East Palestine earlier this year sparked an outcry over what critics call insufficient safety regulation of the transportation of hazardous materials. Sensors on the track – whose parameters were set by the private rail company, Norfolk Southern – failed to alert conductors in time that a car bearing had become wildly overheated, according to initial findings by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).The Norfolk Southern train derailed 38 cars, including 11 known to contain toxic materials, causing explosions, a fire and a massive plume of smoke. The spilled cargo included vinyl chloride, a flammable chemical known to cause liver cancer. Rail officials, concerned at the prospect of the vinyl chloride exploding, chose to burn off the chemical in a controlled fire.Residents in the immediate vicinity of the East Palestine derailment were ordered to evacuate in case of an explosion, but most were told to shelter in place. Officials from the rail company and from the US Environmental Protection Agency have said that the area is now safe, but some independent scientists and outside activists have expressed grave concerns.Writing in the Guardian, Stephen Lester, a toxicologist at the nonprofit Center for Health, Environment & Justice, argued that the decision to burn off the vinyl chloride “unleashed a gigantic cloud full of particulates that enveloped surrounding neighborhoods and farms in Ohio and Pennsylvania”.Burning vinyl chloride generates dangerous compounds called dioxins, Lester said, which are associated with the military herbicide Agent Orange and with Love Canal, New York, the site of one of the most notorious chemical disasters in the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In an op-ed in the Guardian on Monday, Mascher noted that his granddaughters developed bright red rashes on their bodies in the days following the derailment and that he has suffered from headaches and a chronic cough.On Friday, utility officials shut down a nuclear plant near Minneapolis after discovering that water contaminated by radioactive material was leaking from the plant for the second time.In November, the utility company Xcel Energy said that about 400,000 gallons (1.5m liters) of water tainted by tritium had leaked. This month’s leak was caused after a temporary fix appeared to have failed. Company and government health officials say that residents shouldn’t have any reason to be concerned."

        "text": "Throughout 2023, the hottest year in recorded history, fossil fuel giants doubled down on their planet-heating business models.Revealed: how top pop stars are used to ‘launder the reputation’ of Koch familyRead moreThe moves flew in the face of oil and gas companies’ promises to tamp downtheir emissions and prioritize cleaner forms of energy. It is evidence they are “unfit to have a role in the energy transition”, said Collin Rees, the US program manager at Oil Change International.Oil majors have over the past several years announced seemingly ambitious climate plans. BP promised to cut its fossil fuel investments by 35 to 40%. Shell pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Exxon, meanwhile, said it would slash its emissions and gas burning and touted its investments in algae as a potential carbon-free fuel. Chevron announced an “aspiration” to reach net-zero upstream emissions by 2050. And dozens of oil companies signed onto an initiative to cut their methane emissions.But in 2023, firms took actions that stood in sharp contrast to those plans.“Companies have gotten more brazen about their plans to keep polluting,” said Rees. “They took the mask off.”In October, ExxonMobil agreed to buy the shale group Pioneer Natural Resources, and Chevron announced plans to acquire the Texas oil company Hess – two of the country’s largest oil and gas deals in decades.Both mergers are being investigated by federal regulators for potentially impeding competition. And both amounted to Exxon and Chevron placing vast bets on a continued future for fossil fuel production in the US, despite scientific consensus that coal, oil and gas must be phased out to avert the worst consequences of the climate crisis.Fossil fuel companies reneged on their previous climate promises earlier in the year, too. BP scaled back its emissions-slashing goal from 35% by the decade’s end to a 20 to 30% cut, while ExxonMobil quietly walked back funding in algae-based biofuels and Shell announced that it would not increase its investments in renewable energy in 2023.A major reason for the change in tack was a shifting market, experts say. As fossil fuels were becoming less profitable years ago, companies announced plans to diversify their business models. But gas prices surged after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and fossil fuel companies saw record profits.The US as a whole extracted more oil and gas than ever before in 2023. And globally, fossil fuel companies invested twice as much in oil and gas as they should, if they wanted to avert catastrophic levels of heating, the global energy watchdog International Energy Agency found last month.“They have left no doubt that their pledges were deployed for cynical political purposes, only to be ditched when they no longer suited the industry’s strategic position,” Dan Cohn, global energy transition researcher at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told the Guardian in July.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Needlessly wide roads should be torn up and replaced with boulevards of new housing, a thinktank led by the UK government’s most senior urbanism adviser has proposed, in a move likely to delight green belt campaigners but rile the motoring lobby.Create Streets wants sweeping T-junctions tightened, vast roundabouts “tamed” and expressways narrowed according to a paper to be circulated to ministers and seen by the Guardian.Amid a worsening housing crisis that is increasing pressure to erect homes in the countryside, it says: “Forget green belt. This is Britain’s road belt and it’s time to build on it.”Early stage design projects to test the approach are under way in Rochdale, Bedford and Southend-on-Sea.The idea comes as motoring and housing rise up the political agenda. Amid signs of a culture war, Rishi Sunak has told motorists he is “on their side” and launched a review of low-traffic neighbourhoods. He unsuccessfully tried to overrule Sadiq Khan’s extension of London’s £12.50 a day ultra low emissions zone. Both initiatives have become lightning rods for wider political debates about personal freedom, inequality and, in some cases, conspiracy theories about shadowy forces attempting to control the population.Meanwhile, the government is 125,000 below its target to build 300,000 homes a year by the middle of this decade, based on official figures for England for the year to April, and its latest planning policy requires “suitable brownfield sites and underutilised land” to be used before the green belt.Create Streets was founded by Nicholas Boys Smith, who leads the government’s new “building beautifully” agency, the Office for Place. It has influenced the Conservatives’ latest planning policies and counts one of King Charles’s leading urbanism advisers, Ben Bolgar, among its collaborators.Its proposal states: “We could create proud boulevards lined with beautiful homes on space currently given over to needlessly, counterproductively wide roads.”The road junction at St Mary’s Gate, Rochdale, where Create Streets is proposing to remove a turning lane.Boys Smith said: “It is no secret that the most productive and prosperous cities, including London … don’t exclusively rely on cars to get around,. It is time not to widen our road belt but to build upon it.”Steve Gooding, the director of the pro-motoring thinktank the RAC Foundation, said narrowing roads would require planners to decide which traffic they no longer wanted.“Grand visions need to be backed up by meticulous planning and adequate funding if they are to be turned into a livable reality where our shops are well-stocked, our kids can get to school, and our home deliveries arrive when we expect them,” he said.He conceded that increasing the number of 20mph zones meant sweeping junctions and large roundabouts designed decades ago for higher speeds could be revisited, but “it remains to be seen whether linking that with housing development unlocks the scale of investment that’s currently beyond the reach of our cash-strapped local councils”.David Milner, the deputy director of Create Streets, who wrote the policy paper, said: “Working together, there is no reason these redundant spaces can’t be turned into beautiful streets and beautiful homes.”A scheme involving Rochdale council is exploring removing a turning lane from a four-lane urban highway at St Mary’s Gate in the north of the town, allowing designers to create a corner block, and adding 400 homes.Milner said Birmingham was one place that had partly “broken its concrete collar”, where the fast inner ring road was removed in the late 1980s. In Bedford, a plan has been mooted for 105 homes by redesigning the wide Greyfriars roundabout."

        "text": "A new populist party surfing a wave of rural anger at government environmental policies has emerged as the big winner in Dutch provincial elections, dealing a heavy blow to the four-party coalition of the prime minister, Mark Rutte.The success of the Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB) in Wednesday’s vote, which will determine the makeup of the senate, casts doubt over the government’s ability to pass key legislation, including its plans to slash nitrogen emissions.“The Netherlands has clearly shown we’re fed up with these policies,” BBB’s founder, Caroline van der Plas, told the public broadcaster NOS. “It’s not just about nitrogen, it’s about citizens who are not seen, not heard, not taken seriously.”Van der Plas, a former agricultural journalist who founded the BBB four years ago, said the party was “ready to talk with everybody”, adding that the movement “cannot be ignored any longer. The train in The Hague keeps rolling. We’re going to stop it.”With almost 90% of votes counted, the BBB had secured a share of 19% – enough, according to projections, to give it 15 members in the 75-seat senate when the provincial assembly members choose the new upper house in late May. That would make the new party the biggest bloc in the upper chamber with the combined Labour (PvdA) and GreenLeft parties, also projected to have 15 senators. Rutte’s coalition is on course to see its combined seat total fall to 24 from 32.Rutte, prime minister since 2010, congratulated Van der Plas but said on Thursday the outcome did not threaten the government. “I think the cabinet can remain stable over the coming years, because we have parties that want to take responsibility,” he said.At the very least, however, the result looks likely to severely complicate the remainder of his premiership. In principle, the rightwing liberal leader could turn to the PvdA/GreenLeft alliance for the senate majority needed to pass new legislation. In practice, both parties have said they will block the coalition’s entire climate programme unless it goes further and faster, for example by closing all coal-fired power stations within two years and halting subsidies for fossil fuel-based industry.Rutte’s task is likely to be even more difficult in the 12 provincial assemblies, which are charged with putting government environment plans into action: the BBB finished first in five of them, on some occasions with scores of more than 30%.The government aims to buy farmers out and reduce livestock numbers by up to a third to help halve nitrogen emissions by 2030. Soil and water nitrogen levels exceed EU limits in the Netherlands, the world’s second-biggest agricultural exporter.The same problem has also halted construction projects despite a major housing crisis, with environmental groups winning court cases ordering the government to limit emissions and preserve nature before new building permits can be granted.The BBB, which has won the support of far-right and populist parties internationally, claims the problem has been exaggerated and that farmers’ livelihoods are being sacrificed to the green transition.The election also showed how fickle the fortunes of populist parties can be. The vote share of the far-right Forum for Democracy (FvD), led by Thierry Baudet, which won nearly 15% of the vote in 2019 provincial elections, plunged to 3%."

        "text": "It’s now been five years since we entered into a Countryside Stewardship environmental agreement on the farm, and fenced off a wide riparian strip alongside the River Lune. There were already quite a few trees in this patch – mainly oak, sycamore and rowan – but the livestock exclusion has allowed some to self-seed and regenerate. One of the rowans is now taller than me.The farmhouse looks out over part of the strip, and we can hear a variety of birdsong coming from it. The gamechanger for recording what species are living there has been the Merlin bird ID app. I downloaded it last week and since then have been making recordings as I do my work on the farm.This morning I recorded the birdsong as I walked across the field to let the hens out. I recognised the cuckoo and robin, but there were other songs I didn’t know. The app told me they were greenfinch, spotted flycatcher and hawfinch. I did another recording to make sure – the same species came up again. Across the day it picked up calls by willow warbler, blackcap, song thrush, peregrine, snipe, short-eared owl … All the while I’ve been trying to get my “ear in”, and can now recognise a wren, having heard it so many times this week.View image in fullscreenPart of Andrea Meanwell’s farm, where livestock are fenced out. Photograph: Andrea MeanwellI Googled the species and was amazed to find that many of them are red-listed birds, meaning they are of the highest conservation concern in the UK. I knew that the tree sparrows that inhabit our barn are red-listed – a visiting national park authority natural environment adviser told me – but I had no idea there were so many others. I imagine the app isn’t right every time, but it is making my summer mornings doing farm work more interesting, and it’s heartening to know that, with our wilded strip, we’re doing our bit.The cows are now out of the barns where they have been living for the winter, lying in the sun and enjoying the warm weather as much as we are. Every couple of days we move them to fresh grass. It is hot so we all walk slowly, oystercatchers peeping overhead. That’s one bird call I don’t need the app for – it’s the sound of summer here.

Hundreds of acres of cotton, tomato and pistachio fields, workers’ homes, roads and power infrastructure are submerged within the lake, much of it beyond the sight of the visitors who have flocked to the shoreline. They have stopped by new viewing points and trudged to road closure signs with drones in hopes of seeing the historic lake first-hand.“On the lake, you wouldn’t know where you were if you [hadn’t heard it] was going on,” said Nate Ferrier with the county sheriff’s office. “It’s water as far as the eye can see.”The central valley, California’s agricultural heartland, had endured a grueling drought for years before the winter brought a spate of storms that transformed the area, causing the lake to re-emerge and threatening nearby communities with flooding. In the immediate aftermath, the sheriff’s office was working overtime to respond to the disaster, including rescuing people who drove into the body of water. Small animals could be seen dead around the shore.The long-dry Tulare Lake, once the largest lake west of the Mississippi, has returned. But authorities say the water isn’t safe for recreation. Photograph: Caroline Brehman/EPAThe storms are gone, but the lake remains. Fish have made their home in the water. Birds can be seen flying all around the lake, or settling in marsh-like areas.“It was truly a sight to behold,” Ferrier said of his tour of the water.But the destruction of the storms can be seen within the lake, which is considered private property and closed to the public. The water is not safe to swim in or recreate in any capacity, Ferrier added. “It’s farmland, underwater. You’ve got diesel fuel, oil, manure, chemicals used to kill bugs and stuff. You’ve got a whole lot of things floating around.”Rains bring California lake back from the dead: ‘We’re surrounded by water’Read moreAlso underwater are miles of power lines and electrical equipment crucial to powering the area. The area’s power utility, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), has undertaken a massive effort to retrieve its equipment from the lake, said Denny Boyles, a company spokesperson. That has included testing the lake water and bringing in airboats and helicopters.“We had to bring in dive teams because some of our equipment was already so deep,” he said.To remove 50 of its electrical transformers, which use a mineral oil coolant and can weigh up to 13,000lbs, the company had to have divers disconnect the equipment and then bring in heavy-lift Chinook helicopters to bring it to shore. Anything that couldn’t withstand being inundated for the foreseeable future had to be retrieved, Boyles said.The lake is roughly the size of Lake Tahoe at about 178 sq miles of water, but just 5- to 7-ft deep, Ferrier said.While the lake has begun to recede, officials say it will stay at its current size for at least another year. Experts warn it could continue to grow and called for officials to take more action, including a coordinated flood response plan.“We’re out of the woods for this year,” Deirdre Des Jardins, an independent water researcher, told the Los Angeles Times, warning that next year could bring “extreme precipitation”.Lake Tulare reformed this winter when a series of ‘atmospheric river’ storms sent record amounts of rain and snowmelt flooding across farmland. Photograph: David McNew/Getty ImagesMeanwhile, officials around the lake are preparing for the long haul – the sheriff’s office recently obtained an airboat to patrol the waters. It had previously been utilizing one from PG&E.“We’ve never needed an airboat, said Ferrier. “It really is the only way to travel on the lake because of all the debris,” he said.Despite the destruction, Ferrier, a sergeant with the Kings county sheriff’s office, said the lake was special to see particularly for residents who grew up hearing about the body of water.“It’s been actually a pretty neat experience honestly. We’ve all heard about the lake,” he said. “We’re good with folks who want to drive out there and take pictures – I took my own family out there. But stay out of the water.”"

In 2021, on average the abundance of 130 breeding species was 12% below its 1970 value. Though much of this loss was between the late 1970s and the late 1980s, caused mostly by relatively steep declines in woodland and farmland birds, there was still a significant 5% decrease between 2015 and 2020.Between 2015 and 2020, 24% of species increased, 28% showed little change and 48% declined. Woodland birds continue to fare the worst, with a 12% decline between 2015 and 2020.Wildlife experts agree that the decline in bird populations is largely driven by habitat loss.The government passed the Environment Act into law in 2021, which requires a halt in species decline by 2030. Campaigners have said that radical changes to government policy are needed if it is to meet its own legally binding targets.Richard Benwell, the CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “As political parties turn their sights to the general election, they would do well to heed the warning written into today’s wild bird statistics. The decline of nature has continued, relentless and unabated, for decades.“Meeting the legally binding target to stop wildlife losses by the end of the next parliament can’t be achieved with a legal tweak here, some spare change there. Serious, sustained investment, proper penalties for pollution, and action in every sphere of government must be the hallmarks of any nature-positive manifesto.”Britain ranks bottom in Europe for nature connectednessRead moreDr Richard Gregory, the RSPB’s head of science, said: “Everyone should be concerned that UK bird populations are continuing to decline as this is a crucial indicator of the condition of our environment and health of our natural world. We cannot keep publishing report after report charting the decline of the UK’s wildlife without UK governments delivering on their commitments to take urgent action to restore nature and halt wildlife decline.“We are in a nature and climate emergency, and we need urgent action to keep common species common and save those already on the brink of being lost. This is not something on the distant horizon, but on our doorsteps.“The UK is among the most nature-depleted countries in the world, bottom of the table compared to the rest of the G7, but we can change this if we begin to seriously address the drivers of wildlife decline in the UK.”The government admits that the state of the bird population is a good indicator for how other species are faring, which means that if they are in decline, there is a good chance other wildlife are too.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: “Bird populations have long been considered to provide a good indication of the broad state of wildlife in the UK. This is because they occupy a wide range of habitats and respond to environmental pressures that also operate on other groups of wildlife.“In addition, there are considerable long-term data on trends in bird populations, allowing for comparison between trends in the short term and long term. Because they are a well-studied taxonomic group, drivers of change for birds are better understood than for other species groups, which enable better interpretation of any observed changes.”A Defra spokesperson said: “Under the Environmental Improvement Plan, we set out clear steps to halt the decline in species abundance by 2030 and improve the status of wild birds and other species which play an important role in our ecosystems. We are already taking robust action to reduce key pressures on wild birds and improve their habitats. For example, our targeted species recovery efforts have helped to improve the conservation status of 96 priority species, including the curlew and bittern.”"

        "text": "Scaling Rishi Sunak’s empty home to drape it in black fabric in protest at oil drilling is not the first time Greenpeace has targeted the home of senior politicians.The environmental group surrounded David Cameron’s Cotswolds cottage in 2014 to campaign against his support for fracking, and mounted the roof of John Prescott’s home in 2005 in a demonstration against the government’s slowness on climate targets. It has also previously carried out stunts at Sunak’s North Yorkshire mansion.But this time, No 10 was in no mood to turn a blind eye. The government ordered an immediate ceasing of ties with the group, which engages with departments on a range of policy issues.Sunak government will go down in history as failing UK on climate, Greenpeace saysRead moreClambering on to a politician’s home was always going to be a controversial move. Some countries, such as Ireland, are taking steps to ban protests outside politicians’ houses, and MPs have a right to be concerned about their security after the murders of Jo Cox and David Amess.But anyone with a cursory glance at Greenpeace’s history would know the organisation’s commitment to non-violent peacefulness during its direct action protests.Its policy experts are regularly consulted by Whitehall officials and they are regarded as an integral part of the non-governmental organisation ecosystem campaigning for global progress on the climate emergency.However, casting Greenpeace activists as extremists appears to suit the Conservative’s aims of trying to paint Labour as being allied to “woke” organisations.A culture war campaign is under way to associate Keir Starmer with “lefty lawyers” who support asylum seekers in their efforts to come to the UK, as well as “a criminal eco mob” of Just Stop Oil protesters because one of the group’s donors has also given money to the Labour party.The refusal to deal with Greenpeace is part of this drive. Shortly after cutting ties with the organisation, Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, called on Starmer to ban members of Greenpeace from standing for parliament after it emerged a Labour candidate for Mid-Bedfordshire had taken part in a zombie-themed protest outside the Home Office against the public order bill.“Labour have gone too far this time – plotting to put eco-fanatics in parliament,” he said.The government has claimed to stand up for free speech and against “cancel culture”, appointing a Cambridge philosophy professor as a “free speech tsar” for universities in opposition to the no-platforming of people because of their views.However, Sunak’s administration appears far less tolerant of free speech for people with different goals to its own – or when it suits them to create a clear dividing line with Labour.The prime minister’s government believes the voting public – however keen they are in opinion polls to show they support climate policies – are suspicious of activists who disrupt daily life, being concerned about anti-motorist policies and less favourable towards net zero when it starts affecting their cost of living.Politics has held a fragile consensus on the need to tackle the climate crisis for some time, but Labour is acutely conscious of the Conservatives’ attempts to make the speed and spend on achieving net zero into an electoral issue.Anticipating more Conservative attacks, Starmer last Sunday distanced the party from the “contemptible” disruption of groups such as Just Stop Oil and called on Sunak to stop “trying to create a cultural wedge between motorists and those who want to tackle climate change”.The risk is that Sunak’s move to present himself as “eco-pragmatist” against Starmer’s “eco-fanatic” will lead both sides to water down the strength of their net zero policies at the very time the government’s own experts are warning that more, not less, action is needed. This article was amended on 11 August 2023 to clarify reference in the sub-heading to Greenpeace as a ‘charity’. For legal reasons, the organisation’s campaigning arm is a limited company."

        "text": "Everyone who cares about public health and environmental regulation should welcome the expansion of London’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which launches on Tuesday. Air pollution is estimated to cause 4,000 premature deaths each year in the capital, with nitrogen dioxide from exhausts being the main danger, along with particulate matter whose effect is likened by scientists to inhaling tiny particles of tar. Air pollution causes disproportionate harm to low-income families, who are most likely to live on main roads and least likely to own cars. It is particularly damaging to children’s growing lungs. That the mayor, Sadiq Khan, has defied pressure to delay or weaken the scheme is to his credit.In France, vehicles that do not meet new limits have been banned from urban areas. In London, drivers of non-compliant vehicles – mostly petrol ones dating from before 2005, and diesel before 2015 – must pay a daily charge of £12.50, with higher charges for lorries and coaches. While no scheme is flawless, the improvements to air quality achieved by the existing scheme, covering inner London, mean that Londoners can be confident of the extension’s health benefits.There is no point, however, in denying the risks. Mr Khan’s decision to press ahead was made easier because of Labour’s large lead in London polls and with the Conservatives in disarray. However, opponents to Ulez expansion have been emboldened by the Tories’ narrow victory in July’s Uxbridge byelection, where the scheme was seen as a factor in the campaign. In Manchester, another Labour mayor, Andy Burnham, paused a planned clean air zone in the face of rising protests and cost of living pressures. His argument is a good one: the Treasury should fund a scrappage scheme, compensating businesses and owners of polluting vehicles, to ensure they do not bear a disproportionate cost.Under the terms of London’s £110m scheme (funded by the mayor), owners of disqualified cars can apply for a £2,000 payment, with differing terms for motorcycles and vans used by businesses. Earlier this month, eligibility was widened so that applicants no longer need to be on benefits. Mr Khan has done the right thing because central government did not. Such measures should also help calm his party leadership’s nerves, post-Uxbridge, and win over some voters worried about rising bills. Nevertheless, police in London have warned of the risk of vandalism to fixed cameras.Air quality matters to voters but so do living standards, including transport costs, the personal freedom associated with driving, and fairness. The struggle to reconcile these priorities is why the significance of the Ulez scheme goes beyond London. Finding ways to protect the environment, while sharing out the cost of the transition away from fossil fuels, is the key public policy challenge of our time.It speaks volumes about Rishi Sunak that rather than come up with solutions he prefers to whip up resentment about the need to adopt greener lifestyles. Such grievances are not entirely without basis. Small business owners, or drivers of 10-year-old diesel cars, may feel legitimately angry about policies targeting them rather than multiple-car households or the growing number of private jets. Ministers have given financial assistance to Birmingham, Bristol and Portsmouth to help fund their clean air zones, but have refused to support London’s scheme. Rather than capitulate in the face of Tory attempts to exploit the climate crisis for short-term political gain, Labour nationally should call them out."

        "text": "I was glad to read Jonathan Freedland’s thoughts on why environmentalists are failing to get the message of the planetary crisis across (As heat records break, the climate movement has the right answers – but the words are all wrong, 14 July). However, I don’t agree that here in the UK the main obstacles are ignorance and disbelief. Despite the lack of sufficient media coverage, I think that a large proportion of the adult population is aware of what is happening and anxious about the future (though not necessarily following through on sufficient lifestyle changes). They are preoccupied with the demands of everyday life and not convinced or inspired to join collective action.The main campaigning organisations in which I am involved have so far failed to get across the message that we are all, as humanity, in the same precarious situation and must unite in demanding that our governments act with proportionate urgency. We must speak as one and act in ways that are inviting to others to act with us or alongside us.We need to convince politicians that we are in a global emergency and that they cannot carry on as if that were not so. Our current essentially two-party, adversarial system must be transformed, so that addressing the climate and ecological crisis becomes a cross-party agenda; and international policies of contest for dominance must give way to serious and urgent efforts for cooperation to meet the survival needs of humanity, and of the Earth as we know it. Diana Francis Bath The planet is indeed burning, as we hear and read about in terrifying detail every day. And some people are acting. Just Stop Oil are on the streets of London and have been every day for 13 weeks. Booed, shouted at, manhandled off the road and arrested. This is what happens to those who try to sound the alarm. This is what happens to those who demand that the government immediately halt all new oil, gas and coal projects. We cannot just “hope that we still have time to avert the worst”. We are in a climate emergency. We have to make those who take the big decisions, those who run the country – our government – act now and act responsibly. The futures of young people all over the world are unbelievably bleak. Our government is failing in its duty to protect its citizens. We don’t need “ad men”. We need leadership at this time of unprecedented crisis. Anne TaylorOxford I take exception to the suggestion in Jonathan Freedland’s article that the climate emergency is in some part the fault of climate scientists for not using stronger language. I remember the reaction when stronger language was used. Up went the cry of “scaremongering”. Climate scientists were told to moderate their language or they wouldn’t be listened to.Climate scientists have behaved with integrity, knowledge, determination, persistence and self-sacrifice. They made sure that all governments were well acquainted with the facts. In doing so, they hoped they would be dealing with rational, responsible, resolute people. Who else would you go to? But they were wrong; governments were soon shown to be poorly educated – more swayed by belief than by evidence – and also supine.Climate scientists, not perfect of course, are nevertheless the only people to emerge with any credit at all from the climate catastrophe. Dr Barrie Dale Charney Bassett, Oxfordshire The final letter above was amended on 25 July 2023 to remove a suggestion, introduced during editing, that its author is a climate scientist."

        "text": "As a travel writer, I’m used to receiving invitations to five-star resorts in far-flung destinations such as the Seychelles, all expenses paid. But now I ignore these emails. I quit flying three years ago. I’m not afraid to fly; I stopped because of the climate crisis. In addition to travel, I write about green issues, and I decided I could no longer in good conscience specialise in sustainability while continuing to fly.I was a late convert to the cause, taking a plane to Israel in 2020 to write about a Palestinian cycle advocacy group. A trip like that would be off limits to me today, even if peace broke out any time soon. It’s all but impossible to reach Israel from Europe without flying. It’s almost as tough to reach the Antipodes from the UK without a long-haul flight, so bang goes a quick-ish trip to New Zealand or Australia.I could still get to North America if I waited for one of the monthly crossings on Cunard’s Queen Mary 2 to New York from Southampton, but I couldn’t get there in a rush: there and back would take two weeks (and tickets for paying travellers start at around £1,000, one way).Quitting flying has undoubtedly shrunk my world. But I still do long-haul trips within Europe, using high-speed trains and slow-speed sleeper services. I also take to the water: I’ve written up train-and-ferry trips to Malta, Sardinia and Ibiza. I also crossed the Dover Strait on a test sail for a proposed wind-powered catamaran ferry from Dover to Boulogne.And, somewhat surprisingly, my work hasn’t suffered. Without flying, I’ve still been able to file copy from the European Commission in Brussels, penned business stories from the Tour de France’s visit to Denmark and swanned around Sweden on a press launch for a new electric car. When I reported on the opening ceremony of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in 2021, I cycled there from Newcastle. When I had to go back for the summit’s closing, I took the Caledonian Sleeper train from London.But for all this eco street cred, I can’t help but feel I am a lousy flight-free advocate because I’m yet to convince my family to follow suit. Last year, my wife flew to Madeira without me (there are no ferries to the island), and at the time of writing this piece, our three millennial kids were on separate flight-based holidays in Belgium, Dubai and Greece.When I moan, ever so gently, about their chosen mode of (planet-trashing) travel, they point out I’m a hypocrite because – and it’s true – I have spent a lifetime flying. Piqued by my holier-than-thou snarks, they argue I am in no position to lecture them. That is a fair point, and I put it to Maja Rosén, co-founder of We Stay on the Ground, who has not flown since 2008 and coordinates the worldwide “flight-free” movement.“We need to be cutting emissions now,” she told me, but she couldn’t conjure an argument that worked with my family. “There are so many ways to explore the world without flying,” she tried, which is true, but that cuts no ice with those with itchy feet who can’t afford the sky-high prices of long-distance train travel.Scrawled bits of paper and an A-Z: How I went cold turkey on Google Maps | Ned VesseyRead moreTravelling by train instead of flying is also deemed by many to be “virtue signalling”. There’s even a new Swedish word for this: tagskryt – “train bragging” – to describe how some people, myself included, crow about their long-distance journeys by train when others fly. Because it’s quick, cheap and egalitarian, flying remains the done thing.Might the digital nomad argument – the notion that you can work on trains – cut through? Probably not, and it’s oversold anyway. For all my ambitious plans to bang out article after article when travelling by rail, I tend to doom-scroll in much the same way I’d do up in the clouds. And the views from a train might be captivating in daylight, but rolling through Schleswig-Holstein at night is just as dull as traversing it from 30,000ft above.I’m left with the best reason for not flying: it’s simply better for the planet. Yet, for all the evidence that flying is bad for our long-term survival as a species, those who seek to restrict jet-setting are seen as party poopers. So be it. I remain happy that I kicked the habit, but I can’t deny I miss the idea of travelling to far-flung destinations only accessible by plane. My solution: I’ve trained my inbox to junk the invitations.\nCarlton Reid is a freelance transport journalist\n"

        "text": "Some of the UK’s biggest construction companies, property developers and estate agencies have written to Rishi Sunak to warn that his weakening and postponement of green policies will harm investment in housing and cause hardship for many people.More than 100 companies, including some of the UK’s biggest construction specialists, have urged the prime minister to reinstate the net zero policies, or find alternatives that “make upgrading Britain’s homes affordable”.The Guardian revealed earlier this week that housebuilders and property developers have benefited by billions of pounds from delays to low-carbon building regulations in the past eight years of Conservative government, while the sector became one of the biggest sources of donations to the Tory party – almost £40m since 2010, according to a Guardian analysis.In the last fortnight alone, Sunak has dismayed businesses and investors by rolling back several key low-carbon measures, including scrapping the proposed requirements for landlords to insulate and upgrade their properties to be more energy-efficient. He also announced a delay to the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars, from 2030 to 2035, softened measures to phase out gas boilers, and is pressing ahead with plans to scrap rules on sewage from new housing.These delays are only the latest example of a number of low-carbon measures that have been held up or ditched over years of Conservative government, with the result that homeowners and taxpayers will have to pay tens of billions of pounds to bring newly built homes up to low-carbon standards.The delays have resulted in years of unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions, and higher energy bills for residents.There is some division on the subject within the construction and development sector; while some developers may welcome any delay to low-carbon measures, others are looking more to the future.The letter to Sunak, seen by the Guardian, notes that many construction and property companies were planning to make substantial investments in net zero, which are now in doubt. The 114 signatories include Arup, Laing O’Rourke Construction, BNP Paribas Real Estate, Landsec, BAM, Buro Happold, Grosvenor, Avison Young, Great Portland Estates, Knight Frank, AECOM, Clarion Housing Group, and CBRE Group.“Our industry has been working hard to gear up for that acceleration [of effort needed to meet net zero], but your announcement signalled less not more action needed,” the letter says. “In order to bring forward big financial investments, to recruit and train hundreds of thousands of people and to bring the public along with us in this journey we need confidence in long-term active policy support from government. Your announcement has set that back.”The signatories also take issue with Sunak’s insistence that his delays would save money for households. “The longer we delay and the more we see stop-start piecemeal policy-making, the harder and more expensive the task becomes,” they say.The signatories urge Sunak to “bring forward a comprehensive national strategy to retrofit our homes and buildings including much higher sustained government investment and market drivers to stimulate private investment as well as regulation. This would pay dividends to the treasury in tax returns.”They also call for a new “future homes and building standard”. This was supposed to be in consultation by now, but a government spokesperson told the Guardian the aim was now to publish a consultation by the end of this year.Simon McWhirter, the deputy chief executive at the UK Green Building Council, which organised the letter, said: “It’s beyond disappointing and simply reckless to see this false narrative from government that delaying climate action would reduce costs to households.“Decisions now – whether around retrofit or the quality of our new buildings – will dictate the quality and legacy of what we’re able to achieve for generations. Delaying policies just means they’ll have to be implemented much faster, later, pushing up the cost for everyone – householders and businesses alike.”Tor Burrows, the group sustainability director at the property company Grosvenor, said: “Diluting the UK’s commitment to net zero is not the way to build our economy, create jobs or address climate change. Businesses desperately need clarity and stability to help them plan how they will invest in green practices, tech and skills. Without this we risk losing out on crucial investment which will ease the cost of living and increase the country’s global reputation and competitiveness.”Jonathan Gibson, the principal and global director for environmental, social and corporate governance at Avison Young estate agents, said: “While we understand the challenges posed by the cost of living crisis and approaching elections, we must not compromise our long-term sustainability goals for short-term political gains. I urge the incoming government, especially in the context of the forthcoming general elections, to reconsider this regressive stance on net zero policies and demonstrate a genuine commitment to tackling climate change.”"

That social progress was achieved through mass protest, through disruption.“It is a real shame that both the major parties in South Australia seem to have forgotten that proud history, as they work together to try and take away people’s basic rights.”"

        "text": "Claims that airport expansion will help grow the UK economy should be treated with scepticism, according to a report that finds air travel does not increase productivity or growth.Declining business travel and lower wages in aviation undermine claims made by the industry for the value of increased air connections, say researchers at the New Economics Foundation.A report by the NEF due to be published this week says that despite booming air travel in the past few decades, only one in 12 flights in 2022 was taken for business purposes – half the proportion in 2013 – while the number of associated jobs was lower than in 2007. Wages fell faster in real terms between 2008 and 2022 than in any other UK sector.Far more passengers are flying on holiday abroad than into the UK, with the NEF report finding a £32bn “travel deficit” in net spending between outbound and inbound tourism in 2019.Airports around the UK are seeking to expand, despite the recommendation of the Climate Change Committee that there should be no additional capacity to meet the country’s 2050 net zero targets.Britain’s biggest airport, Heathrow, has permission to build a third runway, although it says the plans are under review. Last week, Gatwick submitted an application to develop a second runway for full-time use. London City, Luton and Bristol are among other airports planning to expand, while terminal redevelopment at Manchester and Birmingham will also bring more passengers.Gatwick says its growth plans would “inject £1bn into the region’s economy every year”, while Bristol claims that extra flights will create up to 5,000 jobs in the region and provide a £430m economic boost. According to government-endorsed figures in the Airports Commission’s report, Heathrow’s runway would add £61bn in growth over six decades.But the NEF report suggests that since the government’s previous comprehensive assessment of the economics of air transport growth, “strong evidence, grounded in government data and academic research, suggests that the economic merit of expanding the UK’s air transport sector has diminished considerably”.It recommends that the government pause all airport expansion until it has conducted a review of the economic evidence and compatibility with policies on climate change and levelling up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "EU leaders in Brussels have announced €45bn (£39bn) in investments to Latin America and the Caribbean, some of which will speed the shift to clean energy, but made little headway thawing a frozen trade deal that critics say will further degrade the Amazon rainforest.The EU-Celac summit, the first of its kind since 2015, aimed to bring the EU closer to Latin American and Caribbean countries. Disagreements over how to refer to the war in Ukraine in the final text soured negotiations.The investment package, which includes private sector funding, covers projects to extract critical minerals, electrify bus fleets and help protect the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. It also includes projects in areas like healthcare and telecommunications.“It’s not just about how much, but also how we are investing,” said the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, adding that she wanted the money to come with high environmental and social standards.Diplomats at the summit made little progress on the controversial free trade deal with Mercosur, the South American trade bloc, which Von der Leyen said she hoped to conclude this year – beyond a line in the declaration taking note of “ongoing work”.The EU has not ratified the free trade agreement it agreed in 2019 with four Latin American countries – Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay – because it fears doing so will speed up the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Under former president Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil rolled back rules to protect the environment and starved its environment agency of funding to enforce laws. Farmers, loggers and miners cut and burned trees in the Amazon rainforest faster in 2021 than they had in the 15 years beforehand.Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who won Brazil’s presidential election campaign on a platform of protecting the Amazon and Indigenous peoples’ rights, has criticised the EU as “protectionist” for attaching strings to the goods it imports.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, told reporters at the summit it was “not a threat but respect” to apply the same standards at home and abroad. An unlikely alliance has formed in France between environmentalists, who fear the deal will destroy more of the Amazon, and farmers, who worry about competition from foreign imports.The EU hopes fostering trade with Latin America will help it hit its own climate goals. In a speech on Monday, Von der Leyen highlighted the region’s potential for hydrogen – a gas that can be made with renewable energy to clean up industries like steel-making and shipping – and critical raw materials needed for the energy transition, like lithium.“Unlike other foreign investors, we are not only interested in investing in the pure extraction of raw materials,” she said. “We want to partner with you to build local capacity for processing, for making batteries, and for the final products, like electric vehicles.”Ignacio Arróniz Velasco, a trade analyst at climate thinktank E3G, described it as a “subtle but significant shift” in EU rhetoric. During a trip to Latin America last month, Von der Leyen had talked about trade in hydrogen and minerals without adding support for the region’s own industries.The Argentinian president, Alberto Fernández, praised the agreement for moving away from “extractivism”. “This whole idea that Latin America is just a producer of raw materials has always prevented us from industrialising.”The summit, he added, was the first time this had changed. “It took us five centuries but we have succeeded.”Latin America’s biggest trading partner is the US, followed by China, which mostly buys raw materials and crops, and sells manufactured products.European politicians and businesses have tried to diversify their supply chains away from China in the wake of the war in Ukraine, which exposed the continent’s over-reliance on imports of Russian gas. The move has given new importance to trade links with Latin America and the Caribbean.“We don’t want to repeat some of the errors of the past,” said Luisa Santos, the deputy head of lobby group BusinessEurope. “We want to make sure that we don’t put all our eggs in one basket.”The summit declaration also stressed the importance of money to clean up economies, keep people safe on a hotter planet, and pay for damages from extreme weather. In paragraph 23 of the declaration, leaders agreed rich countries would recommit to getting $100bn a year in climate finance to poor countries, a promise that should have been met in 2020, and double finance to adapt to climate change by 2025.Citing the unmet pledge from rich countries, Ralph Gonsalves, the prime minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, said it was important to “hold their feet to the fire”.“It would be an awful thing if you wrote this in paragraph 23 and then in 2025 we have no money.”"

Lead poisoning can cause health problems ranging from learning difficulties to infertility, brain damage and, in some cases, death.Anglo American has denied responsibility for the lead poisoning.In a joint statement, Richard Meeran, a partner at Leigh Day, and Zanele Mbuyisa, a founding partner at Mbuyisa Moleele, said: “We are extremely disappointed by the judgment, which we consider to be fundamentally flawed.Children and adults work daily, weather permitting, digging rocks out of the slag heaps next to the old lead mine at Kabwe. They break up the larger rocks to sell them for building material. The town has an estimated 6m tonnes of lead slag. Photograph: Larry C Price/Larry Price“We remain committed to securing justice for the 140,000 women and children affected by lead poisoning in Kabwe and the communities have made their intention to appeal very clear,” they said.In a 126-page judgment delivered on 15 December, Justice Leonie Windell, of the Johannesburg high court, said: “The applicants seek permission to advance an untenable claim that would set a grave precedent.“The precedent is that a business could be held liable half a century after its activities have ceased, to generations not yet born, as a result of being tested against future knowledge and standards unknown at the time.”The lawsuit was filed in South Africa because Zambia does not allow class-action cases and lawyers are not permitted to act on a contingency-fee basis.The world's most toxic town: the terrible legacy of Zambia's lead minesRead moreThe case was supported by a group of UN special rapporteurs, as well as Amnesty International. They argued that Anglo American’s opposition to the class action was contrary to the company’s own human rights policy and publicly stated commitment to corporate responsibility guidelines introduced by the UN in 2011.Last year, David Boyd, special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, referred to Kabwe as one of the world’s most notorious “sacrifice zones”, where local people were left to suffer the consequences of pollution they did not cause.Richard Price, legal and corporate affairs director at Anglo American, said: “This claim was entirely misconceived from the outset, both legally and factually.“As we have stated throughout, Anglo American has every sympathy for the situation in Kabwe, but we are not responsible for it,” he said. “We welcome the clarity and force of the court’s decision to dismiss this claim as untenable.”"

        "text": "Contact with nature in cities significantly reduces feelings of loneliness, according to a team of scientists.Loneliness is a major public health concern, their research shows, and can raise a person’s risk of death by 45% – more than air pollution, obesity or alcohol abuse.The study is the first to assess how the environment can affect loneliness. It used real-time data, collected via a smartphone app, rather than relying on people’s memory of how they were feeling.The research found that feelings of overcrowding increased loneliness by an average of 39%. But when people were able to see trees or the sky, or hear birds, feelings of loneliness fell by 28%. Feelings of social inclusion also cut loneliness by 21%, and when these feelings coincided with contact with nature the beneficial effect was boosted by a further 18%.The findings pointed to interventions to reduce loneliness, the researchers said: “Specific measures that increase social inclusion and contact with nature should be implemented, especially in densely populated cities.”Time spent in nature is known to boost wellbeing, with woodland walks estimated to save the UK at least £185m a year in mental health costs, for example. Natural places in cities could reduce loneliness by enhancing feelings of attachment to a place, or by providing more opportunity to socialise, the researchers said.The study challenged the traditional view of cities as places that are always bad for mental health and loneliness, according to Prof Andrea Mechelli, part of the research team and an expert in early intervention in mental health at King’s College London in the UK. “There can be aspects such as natural features and social inclusivity which can actually decrease loneliness,” he added.Michael Smythe, an artist who works on social architecture and urban landscapes and was part of the study team, said: “For people like us who work with public space, validating the anecdotal knowledge we get on the ground with data is incredibly valuable in communicating the worth of these spaces. Environmental health and public health are one and the same.”‘These salt marshes saved my life’: how nature is helping mental healthRead moreThe research, published in the Scientific Reports journal, collected data from urban citizens across the world using the Urban Mind research app. People were prompted at three random times a day for a fortnight, during waking hours, to answer simple questions on loneliness, overcrowding, social inclusion and contact with nature.More than 750 people provided 16,600 of these assessments, which included the questions “do you feel welcome among [the people around you]?” and “can you see trees right now?”.The participants were self-selecting and so did not provide a representative sample of the wider populations. But when the researchers took age, ethnicity, education, and occupation into account, the benefits of nature contact and feelings of social inclusion on loneliness remained strongly statistically significant.Christopher Gidlow, a professor of applied health research at Staffordshire University in the UK, who was not involved in the research, said: “It has long been recognised that having access to natural environments can foster social interactions and connectedness. This study adds further weight to existing evidence of our affinity for natural environments and the potential benefits for social wellbeing.“Familiarity with environments was not measured, but is likely to be at play as people tend to visit the same natural environments. Such familiarity has been linked with feeling more connected to a place, with possible mental health benefits.”Johanna Gibbons, a landscape architect and part of the research team, said: “Cities are probably the only habitat that is increasing at a high rate. So we should be creating urban habitats where people can thrive. Nature is a critical component of that because, I believe deep in our souls, there are really deep connections with natural forces.”"

        "text": "A mysterious golden orb that may be an egg laid by an unknown sea creature has been discovered on the ocean floor off the Pacific coast of Alaska.The smooth object with an intriguing hole at the centre was found at a depth of about two miles by a remote-controlled submarine explorer.Scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) in the US, which made the discovery, suggest it could be a hatched egg or a marine sponge.Researchers are conducting tests and a DNA analysis to work out what the shiny object – which feels like “skin tissue” according to Noaa – is.A remotely operated arm was deployed to “tickle” the egg, which was found to have a delicate “skin-like” texture. It was then gently “suctioned” up a tube for testing in a lab. The dive is part of the Seascape Alaska 5 expedition, which will continue until 15 September and can be followed on a livestream.The mission is exploring the Gulf of Alaska, down to depths of four miles, including deep-sea coral and sponge habitats, and geological features such as mud volcanoes.Speaking over the livestream on 30 August, when the discovery was made, team members offered theories about the identity of the object, including an egg casing or a sponge. They suggested that the hole was created by a creature hatching, or by a predator breaking in.“I just hope when we poke it, something doesn’t decide to come out,” one scientist said. “It’s like the beginning of a horror movie.”On images taken from the ocean floor, the object had a golden appearance, but this was attributed to the reflection from the submarine’s headlights. A photo of the object taken in the lab suggests a brown-yellow colour.Several species, including deep-sea fish such as sharks, lay their egg cases on the sea floor, which makes them less likely to be washed away by ocean currents. Sponges are simple aquatic animals with dense, porous, skeletons that attach themselves to rocks.Prof Kerry Howell, a deep-sea ecologist at the University of Plymouth, said that it is not unusual to find new species during exploratory missions, but that it would normally be possible to place them in a broad taxonomic category.“We’ll often see new things but will usually have a pretty good knowledge of what they are. What’s unusual about this thing is we’re not even sure what it is. Is it an egg, is it a sponge, what is it?” she said.“We’re going with egg because of the texture. It felt fleshy and it doesn’t have any obvious anatomy. It has a hole in it that suggests something has come in or gone out. But it doesn’t look like any egg I’ve ever seen,” she added.“If it is an egg, the really interesting question is whose egg is it. It’s quite big. That’s not a small fish egg. That’s a sizeable thing.”DNA tests should be able to establish which family of marine life the orb belongs to, although it is unlikely to be possible to identify a precise species since only a fraction of marine life has been sequenced."

        "text": "Such is the enormity of the problems facing humanity at the start of the 21st century, it is hard to get a perspective on them. How can we comprehend overwhelmingly large events such as the melting of the ice caps at the same time as trying to do something about it? Can the shifting perspectives of puppetry and an object-theatre world, where vast landscapes are rendered in miniature and street-level problems are viewed from above, allow us to think afresh about questions that otherwise seem too close for comfort?Two shows in Edinburgh attempt to come up with an answer. Running in the international festival, Dimanche (★★★☆☆) is a collaboration between Focus and Chaliwaté, two Belgian puppetry and physical theatre companies, and uses a jokey cartoon-like format to take us on a global tour of environmental disasters. In their roles as a wildlife documentary crew, the performers Julie Tenret, Sicaire Durieux and Sandrine Heyraud (who also write and direct) come to an unfortunate end as the ice cracks, the waters rise and the storms brew.As a piece of stagecraft, Dimanche is formidably done. It is not only the variety of techniques, ranging from the manipulation of miniature figures to mime and large-scale puppetry (cute polar bear alert). It is also the astonishing speed with which one scene dissolves into the next: a domestic interior complete with operating chairlift takes the place of an Arctic landscape in an instant.One minute, the undulations of a human body will form the hills and valleys over which toy cars will crawl. The next, a full-size canoe will paddle across rising waters or a performer will dangle precariously from a helicopter’s rope ladder. The inventiveness is constant, be it a house appearing on the underside of an actor’s foot or a playful routine involving an attempt to light a cigarette in a vehicle negotiating uneven terrain. As the heat rises and the fans spin, so the very furniture starts to melt.With its combination of slow-paced visual comedy and images of tsunamis, typhoons and devastated landscapes, it is like an apocalyptic Jacques Tati. And in that sense, Dimanche sits uneasily within the world it is describing. Should we be delighted by the pulsating hands caught in a sidelight like a shoal of fish or should we be alarmed by a vision of a flooded city? Are environmental catastrophes merely material for a set of clever skits, just something else to laugh about?Making connections … Alex Bird in Concerned Others at Summerhall. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianAt the same time, a little humour would not have gone amiss in Concerned Others (★★★☆☆), a similarly inventive if rather smaller-scale show by Edinburgh’s Tortoise in a Nutshell. Devised and performed by Alex Bird, it is about the social impact of drug and alcohol addiction, with particular focus on Scotland, which has the highest rate of drug-related deaths in Europe.To a soundtrack of interviews with health professionals and the “concerned others” who support those affected, Bird focuses his camera on the 32mm figures he positions on a bleak monochrome high street. Later, we see the shoe-box interiors they inhabit as the show makes the connection between addiction and social ills such as sexual abuse, poverty, poor housing and a lack of decent jobs. With animation and masks supplementing the camera work, it is elegantly done and politically well-intentioned, even if something of an illustrated lecture.\nDimanche is at Church Hill theatre, Edinburgh, until 19 August. Concerned Others is at Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 27 August\nAll our Edinburgh festival reviews\n"

The discovery of yellow-spotted stink bugs.Have Australian drivers finally charged into electric vehicles?Read moreThe car-carrying ship Glovis Caravel arrived off Brisbane in late October and has capacity for 6,500 vehicles.Many of those it was carrying were reportedly Tesla Model Ys, though Kia has also confirmed about 1,000 of its vehicles were aboard.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said authorities worked with the vessel’s operators to manage risks after the discovery of live insects.“There were multiple detections, including yellow-spotted stink bug which poses significant threat to Australia’s plant health and environment because of the damage it can do to agricultural crops, fruit and ornamental trees,” according to a spokesperson.“The vessel has left Australian territory on its own accord in order to manage the biosecurity risk associated with the goods.”The ship has since returned to Shanghai, where the vehicles have been unloaded.Customers expecting Tesla Model Ys in December reported receiving updates from the automaker explaining the delay and promising to investigate other options, including assigning them cars “from the next batch of production”.The delay appears to have had significant impact on Tesla in Australia, with sales of its Model Y dropping from 3,157 in November to 1,351 in December, according to the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries.The Electric Vehicle Council chief executive, Behyad Jafari, said the delayed shipment impacted Australia’s entire market.Motorists around the nation bought 87,217 electric cars in 2023, or more than double the figure from 2022, but fell just short of the council’s forecast.“Deliveries of electric vehicles would have passed 100,000 if it wasn’t for this ship being turned around with stink bugs and that would be been nice for us to celebrate,” he said. “Nobody sets out to have these problems come up.”The Australian Electric Vehicle Association national president, Chris Jones, said the issue was not entirely unexpected.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Donald HobernThe bug detected in the cargo ship is common to Asia and could pose a risk to fruit crops if imported into Australia, including pears, peaches, apples and kiwifruit.University of South Australia associate professor Patrick O’Connor said the detection will ultimately benefit the entire community.“For something like turning around a ship or delaying access to EVs, there’s a private cost,” he said. “But otherwise [the price] could be billions of dollars borne by many individuals over generations and have significant consequences that you can’t foresee.”He said Australia may need to further advertise its significant biosecurity penalties to underline the message and ensure this does not happen regularly."

However, concerns remain over how nations will replace Russian gas supplies next winter.In the UK, energy bills are to rise by 40% in April when government support for bills becomes less generous.

        "text": "A loophole in pollution legislation allows farmers to pollute rivers by spreading excess manure, an investigation has found, with those acting unlawfully not facing any action in most cases.The government introduced new farming rules for water in 2018, aimed at cleaning up England’s waterways. However, after lobbying from the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), including at least two meetings with ministers, the guidance was watered down.According to internal guidance revealed by the investigations website openDemocracy, polluting farmers may not even be informed of their rule-breaking.Some farm businesses pollute waterways by spreading excess animal waste on their land. When it rains, this runs off into local rivers, causing nutrient pollution and in severe cases, ecosystem collapse. Natural England recently downgraded the status of the River Wye, a designated special area of conservation, due to a decline of key species. The decline is due partly to large quantities of manure being washed into the river from nearby farms.In August 2021, the NFU met Lord Benyon, then the parliamentary undersecretary for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), to discuss the legislation. Four months later, it attended another meeting, this time with Victoria Prentis MP, then the minister of state for Defra, along with officials from the Environment Agency and the British Egg Industry Council and British Poultry Council, two trade associations representing farmers.In response to a freedom of information request, Defra refused to release the minutes of this second meeting, claiming policymaking in this area was “still ongoing” and that releasing this information could “risk inhibiting officials from having full, frank and open discussions as part of the process of formulating policy”.But in written evidence submitted to parliament’s environment, food and rural affairs committee, the NFU said it was decided in this meeting that an Environment Agency team tasked with implementing the legislation would have its terms of reference “rewritten” to “reflect our dialogue”.The guidance now says: “Where a land manager has acted in accordance with the statutory guidance, we will not inform them that they are non-compliant with the FRfW (farming rules for water).” It allows manure to be spread in direct contradiction with the rules, as long as all “reasonable precautions” are taken to reduce pollution, or in circumstances when reducing manure use is not “reasonably practicable”.“The regulations have not changed,” the document states, but goes on to say that enforcement action will not usually be taken providing farmers “can demonstrate that they are operating in accordance with the statutory guidance even if they are not compliant with regulation 4(1)(a)(i) and (ii)”.These specific regulations are in place to limit how much poultry manure can be spread on farmland, ensuring that nutrients “[do] not exceed the soil and crop needs or give rise to a significant risk of agricultural diffuse pollution”.Charles Watson, the founder and chairperson of River Action UK, said: “That loophole is why the soils are now overloaded several times above and beyond what they can take. It is cause and effect, black and white.“The River Wye has basically turned into a green pea soup. It smells, and what used to be beautiful clean gravel on the riverbed is covered with green slime. The river is now very close to complete ecological collapse.”An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “The farming rules for water are one of a number of regulations we use as part of our advice-led regulatory approach with farmers, to protect water quality and nature. If we find pollution or significant risk of pollution occurring we will not hesitate to take further action – evidenced by the enforcement action being taken against 140 farms this financial year.”The NFU deputy president, Tom Bradshaw, said: “Farmers are working hard, through a range of voluntary measures, to prevent valuable nutrients and soil from contributing to water pollution. We can and want to do more and are working with government, local authorities and regulatory bodies to find solutions to address farming’s impact, so that we can better maintain and protect the health of our rivers.“With a growing population, there is a clear need for sustainable, affordable and environmentally friendly food. We will continue to work closely with partners and stakeholders across all sectors so that collectively we can drive improvements that benefit water quality in our rivers.” This article was amended on 13 July 2023 to refer to England in the headline, rather than the UK."

This is a vital part of our plan to have enough homegrown clean energy, bringing bills down for families and strengthening our energy independence.”Concerns within the offshore wind industry reached a peak after none of the companies hoping to build offshore windfarms in the UK took part in the government’s most recent annual clean energy auction in September.The government started its failed auction at a price of £44 a MWh after the previous round of bidding led to record low contract prices of just over £37 a MWh. Offshore wind developers had repeatedly warned officials that the ceiling price was set too low to make the projects economically viable.That auction was described as “an energy security disaster” by the Labour party, which said that the UK could miss out on billions of pounds in investment and face higher energy bills if the UK’s plan to triple its offshore wind power capacity by 2030 was derailed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Córdoba reached a record 38.8C on Thursday.Spain has been in drought since January last year and this is likely to be the hottest, driest April on record.Meanwhile, British growers have also been facing weather challenges, particularly the cold start to the spring growing season and a lack of sunlight.Fresh produce grown in Spain for UK consumption includes tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuces, broccoli and citrus fruit.Sainsbury’s has warned of further shortages this week. Its chief executive, Simon Roberts, said some problems with fresh produce, such as peppers and eggs, remained.Waitrose, owned by the John Lewis Partnership, said: “We’re working hard with our suppliers to get our full range [of peppers] back on our shelves and expect stock levels to stabilise in the coming weeks as we move into the UK season.”The British Retail Consortium has said difficult weather conditions in the south of Europe disrupted the harvest for some fruit and vegetables including peppers, and Morrisons limited customers to two packs of red peppers earlier this week, although plans to lift restrictions on Monday.Supermarket shelves had big gaps in February, when retailers including Tesco, Aldi, Asda and Morrisons rationed certain products such as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers. The shortages also pushed prices of fresh fruit and vegetables sharply higher.Many UK salad crop producers delayed planting fruit and vegetables because the cold weather made them even more reliant on energy for heating and lighting their glasshouses.Those who did plant crops including cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes and aubergines waited until late March to try to avoid soaring energy bills, according to Lee Stiles from the Lea Valley Growers Association.This pushed back the start of picking to mid-April, when domestic crops have usually started to displace overseas imports, and caused some shortages in domestic supply and led to gaps on supermarket shelves.The lack of spring sunshine had also had an impact, Stiles said: “Currently crops are looking good yet [their growth is] slightly slower due to the light levels. Light levels have been particularly low this year.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tui said demand for the usual final month of the season, October, was 8% higher than last year.The Anglo-German tourism company, which operates hotels, aircraft and cruise ships, took 13.7m bookings for this summer, up 5% from last year and close to pre-pandemic levels, at 96%.Oil hits $95 per barrel; ‘no evidence’ of politicians being debanked over views – business liveRead moreSebastian Ebel, the Tui chief executive, said: “We have seen strong demand in the final weeks of the summer season which traditionally runs to the end of October. As a consequence, we recently announced the extension of the season into November in particular to Turkey and Greece, to cover demand outside the traditional summer season.”He expects global heating will increase demand for cooler destinations in Scandinavia, Belgium and the Netherlands, while the Canary Islands will also “benefit from a more moderate climate”.Tui had been planning for some time to extend the season, which runs from April until November, as more people want to spend the winter in warmer climates or travel there for sports and cultural activities in the spring and autumn.The company said its decision to extend the season to mid-November offered holidaymakers more flexibility over when they wanted to travel. Tui is adding about 30,000 seats on planes from the UK to destinations such as Rhodes, Crete and Antalya.German customers like to spend the winter in Antalya and Tui is extending the offer to British customers.Winter bookings at Tui have also jumped and are 15% higher than last year, despite a 4% rise in prices. It has sold almost two-fifths of its winter holidays in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While Tui says the Mediterranean continues to be the most popular tourist destination, worsening heatwaves and growing fears about the climate crisis may lead to the region losing its allure as a top holiday destination, according to a report published by the European Travel Commission.The report in July said Mediterranean destinations had experienced a 10% drop in visitors compared with last year while countries such as the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Ireland and Denmark were becoming more popular.“We are seeing a strong close to the summer season and we are on course to achieve results in line with expectations,” Ebel said. “Had it not been for the various events during the last few months, which were outside of our control, not least the wildfires on Rhodes, we would have performed ahead of expectations.”"

        "text": "Over-reliance on carbon capture and storage technology could lead the world to surpass climate tipping points, the head of the world’s climate science authority has warned.Hoesung Lee, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said using technologies that capture carbon dioxide or remove it from the atmosphere was “no free lunch” and that countries should be wary.Lee noted that the IPCC had found it was likely that global temperatures could rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels but could then be made to return to below 1.5C by the end of the century. “The jargon for that is the overshoot,” he said. “Carbon dioxide removal methods will be much in demand if that overshoot indeed occurs.”“But there will be a cost to doing that. There’s no free lunch. And that cost includes that the longer the period of overshoot, there will be additional global warming, and there will be consequences of increased warming. There is also the possibility of positive feedback from that additional warming, creating more losses and damages during the overshoot period,” he warned. “So one wishes to avoid such an overshoot scenario.”The IPCC warned in its latest comprehensive report on climate science, published in three parts from 2021 to 2022 with a fourth summary chapter delivered in March, that it was “now or never” to take action on emissions, if the world was to have a chance of avoiding the worst ravages of climate breakdown.Governments must make their own decisions on whether to use carbon capture and storage technology, Lee said, as the IPCC advised only on science, and was neutral on policy. “CCS technologies are all part of the solutions,” he told the Guardian in an interview, at  in Bonn, where preparatory talks for the Cop28 UN climate summit are taking place this week and next. “The way to stay within the carbon budget is that [high-carbon] infrastructures should be equipped with some measures of emissions reductions. Our report very clearly indicates that unabated fossil fuels has to be changed, with some measures that can reduce carbon emissions.”Some representatives of fossil fuel interests have been arguing that the latest IPCC report justifies their continued production of oil and gas, citing a finding that a small amount of oil and gas production in 2050 was compatible with the need to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by that date.But one IPCC author told the Guardian that while the IPCC had found some oil and gas could still be produced in 2050, while sticking to the 1.5C limit, fossil fuel producers should not conclude from this that they could keep operating. “We need to reduce fossil fuels drastically,” the author said.Mark Maslin, professor of earth system science at University College London, said: “Just because there is an understanding that complete removal of fossil fuel use would be almost impossible in this century is no justification to expand production. When we are aiming of a global net zero emission world by 2050 – this means no new fossil production now, halving production over the next 10 years and reducing it as close to zero as possible by 2050. None of this in any way justifies countries expanding their fossil fuel production and to use the IPCC as an excuse is dishonest and a misuse of the science.”Prof Michael Mann, climatologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told the Guardian that oil producers were misrepresenting the IPCC’s findings if they argued for a continued use of fossil fuels. “The IPCC doesn’t weigh in what energy sources will or will not be needed decades from now. While low levels of carbon emissions could be offset with negative emissions technology by 2050, there is no room in such scenarios for substantive reliance on oil, gas, or coal decades from now if we are to achieve the necessary reductions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

However, our report is a public document, produced by experts, and through numerous independent scientific reviews. Decision makers have their own independent judgements for their own policymaking. We provide the science.”Lee will step down as chair of the IPCC in late July, when a new chair will be chosen from four candidates, two of whom are women."

        "text": "A Senate inquiry has called on the New South Wales government to use aerial shooting to cull the growing number of feral horses damaging the environment in the Australian Alps.The report, backed by Labor, Greens and independent senators, also recommended the Albanese government develop a national plan to limit the impact of about 25,000 feral horses in the high country, and boost funding to states and territories to improve alpine environment protection.It found horses posed an extinction risk to native species, including the critically endangered stocky galaxias fish and the southern corroboree frog. The horses, sometimes described as brumbies, have been found to threaten plants and animals by grazing, trampling vegetation and damaging waterways.Kosciuszko brumby numbers surge, prompting accusations of ‘shameful’ NSW mismanagementRead more“It has been made clear that if feral horse populations are not urgently managed, there is a real risk of losing this unique landscape and the native species that call it home,” the committee said.The report said NSW laws protecting feral horses from culling had led to an exponential increase in the population. Data released earlier this year suggested the population grew by 4,000 over two years.The committee recommended the state government address this in part by updating the Kosciuszko National Park Wild Horse Heritage Management Plan to allow aerial shooting to help control numbers.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe NSW government has already indicated it may head in this direction. In August it announced a new plan to deal with horse numbers, and recently began public consultation on allowing aerial culling to meet a commitment to cut the population within the state to 3,000 by mid-2027. The ACT and Victoria already allow aerial shooting, but Victoria has not used it.Coalition senators on the committee published a dissenting report, arguing “the Australian brumby is an important icon of Australian culture” that had “coexisted with humans, and a multitude of other animal and plant species, for over 200 years”.They accused the inquiry of relying on anecdotal data, and said aerial shooting should not be used until “all other control methods” – including fertility control, mustering and trapping, exclusion fencing and ground culling – had been tried.The independent senator David Pocock, who instigated the inquiry with the support of the government and Greens, said the report documented compelling evidence of a catastrophic impact from feral horses, including threatening 12 plants and animals and the quality of 30% of the water in the Murray-Darling Basin.He said all jurisdictions should adopt a “zero tolerance approach to feral horse management”.“Horses are beautiful animals but the evidence to this inquiry documents beyond a doubt that they do not belong in our national parks,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "On your marks, get set, go! Asparagus season has at long last begun, but there are only about six short weeks left before it comes to an end for another year. So let’s make the most of it by with a recipe that celebrates the entire asparagus all the way from its fibrous butt to the delicate tip. I like thick stems of asparagus best, but their bases can be tough. Cutting them into thin rounds should be enough to make them palatable and delicious.Asparagus, wild garlic and almond tartWild garlic and asparagus come into season at about the same time and pair really well, as evidenced by today’s creamy tart. If you can’t find or forage wild garlic, any other green leaf will do, including nettle tops, spinach or kale; otherwise, simply add more leeks.Cracking an egg to make an egg wash usually creates a surplus, because so little of it is actually needed for that task. Instead, crack the eggs for the tart filling into a bowl and use some of that as your egg wash, before adding the cream or any other filling ingredients. The amount you’ll use is so negligible, it won’t affect the recipe. And use any excess pastry to make my malfatti biscuits, topped with emmental and seeds.Serves 6-8For the shortcrust pastry case200g wholewheat flour, preferably spelt, plus extra for dusting100g cold butter, cut into small cubesSalt and black pepper1 eggFor the filling3 eggs350ml double cream1 bunch asparagus 100g dark green leek tops, finely sliced30g butter100g wild garlic, or an other leafy green such as spinach or kale200g cheese odds and ends (eg, goat’s cheese, cheddar and wensleydale), cut into small cubes50g almond sliversTo make the pastry case, put the flour, butter and a pinch of salt in a blender and blitz until the butter is combined finely into the flour. Add the egg and a tablespoon of cold water, then pulse three to five times. Open the top and squeeze together a lump of the pastry – if it doesn’t form into a ball, add another tablespoon of water and pulse again. Repeat if necessary. Turn out the pastry on to a worktop, then, using your hands, bring it together into a ball. Put in a bowl, cover and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to about 5mm thick, then use the pastry to line a greased 20cm tart case, making sure you push it right down into the base and corners. Trim any excess pastry, but leave a few millimetres overhanging the lip to counteract the pastry shrinking (keep any offcuts to make biscuits and bake them alongside the tart case). Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Prick the base all over with a fork to help stop the pastry puffing up, then bake for 20 minutes, or until just cooked.Meanwhile, make the filling. Whisk the three eggs in a large bowl, leaving a little to egg-wash the cooked pastry. Using a pastry brush, paint a layer of egg over the pastry, which will fill any holes or cracks that may have appeared. Return the tart case to the oven for three minutes, then leave to cool.Whisk the double cream into the egg bowl, and season generously.Cut the asparagus into 10cm lengths, then cut these in half lengthways through the tips. Cut the asparagus offcuts into roughly 1cm-thick rounds (if the butt ends are very fibrous, peel them before cutting).Saute the leek tops in the butter for five minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the chopped asparagus ends, add the wild garlic (stalks finely chopped, leaves roughly shredded), and cook for two minutes more. Take off the heat and stir in the cheese.Scatter the vegetable mixture evenly into the blind-baked tart case, pour over the egg and cream mixture, then arrange the spliced asparagus tips on top. Scatter over the almond slivers and bake in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for about 35 minutes, or until only just set. Serve warm with a salad or leave to cool before slicing and serving."

        "text": "Based on a play – a painfully obvious fact given the stiltedness of the dialogue – by Bea Roberts, this small-scale British drama revolves almost entirely around two characters who are followed over a number of years. The early scenes, set in 2001, establish the affectionate friendship between Devon dairy farmer Michael (David Fielder), recently widowed and judging by the beard eligible for a pension soon, and local veterinarian Jeff (Nigel Hastings), a younger man with a budding drink problem.When foot-and-mouth disease reaches their neck of the moors, Jeff is compelled to put down Michael’s entire herd according to governmental guidelines. Michael tries to resist with an unloaded shotgun and some choice curse words aimed at the ministerial enforcers who accompany Jeff, but there’s no stopping the forces of change. As the years pass, agriculture itself comes under threat in a rural economy increasingly skewing towards offering hospitality for wealthy visitors who want to capture sunsets on Instagram rather than see where their meat and milk comes from.It’s a shame that Paul Robinson’s direction and Fielder and Hastings’ performances fail to liberate the film from its stagy origins, because the core concept is pretty compelling. The incremental sociological shifts that have unfolded in rural Britain over the last 20 years or so are indeed fertile soil, ripe for dramatic ploughing. But Roberts’s screenplay only glancingly engages with the issues, in big brushstroke fashion. There are lots of problems that would have affected characters like Michael and Jeff that might have been germane, such as the impact of Brexit or resistance to the foxhunting ban.Alas, the focus is on more quotidian, smaller-scale travails, such as Michael’s fundamental loneliness and Jeff’s crumbling marriage, although the self-imposed restriction to just two speaking parts undermines the exploration of those arcs in any depth. Ultimately, the slushy musical score and prettified cinematography – everything seems to happen at magic hour – prove more irritating than enhancing. Even the title’s inelegant plod of monosyllables comes off as somehow annoying and pretentious.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Film WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is in line with the Morrison government’s target which was resoundingly rejected by Queenslanders at the 2022 election,” Copeman told Guardian Australia.“It doesn’t provide leadership to industry or community in Queensland, because the Queensland energy and jobs plan, and federal policies, such as the safeguard mechanism, make it largely obsolete.”\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nCopeman called for a 60% reduction in emissions by 2030 on 2005 levels, as outlined in an Accenture report, as well as more renewables and storage.Queensland makes up a sizeable chunk of Australia’s emissions and could play a significant role in helping accelerate the transition to net zero, according to climate policy expert Richie Merzian.“Queensland can do better than 30% by 2030,” he said.“The federal government has a stronger target [of 43% by 2030 on 2005 levels]. NSW will halve emissions this decade, so will Victoria, South Australia and the ACT.“There’s space to move forward.”It comes as the Queensland Greens prepare to introduce legislation into parliament this week that would legislate a 75% emissions reduction target by 2030 and net zero by 2035.The proposed legislation is the second part of the Greens’ bill announced last week to ban new coal and gas approvals and phase-out coal, oil and gas exports by 2030.The Greens MP for Maiwar, Michael Berkman, said Queensland had a responsibility to act quickly to cut emissions, with the state “both a major contributor to the climate crisis and on the frontlines of some of its worst impacts”.“We’re introducing a bill to ditch Scott Morrison’s climate targets in Queensland,” Berkman said.“Voters rejected the Coalition’s weak emissions targets at last year’s federal election, yet Queensland Labor’s are almost the same.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "People do not need to glue themselves to anything in order to protest about the climate crisis this weekend, say the organisers of a large-scale planned climate emergency action.The Big One, planned by a coalition of groups brought together by Extinction Rebellion to coincide with Earth Day on Saturday, will be four days of protest and events that they say will be “family friendly” and “engaging”.But XR has also issued two demands: that all licences, approvals and funding for fossil fuel projects must end, and that the UK government must create emergency citizens’ assemblies to lead on fair, long-term solutions. The organisation says the government must engage with the demands by 5pm on Monday, and that if it does not, “unprecedented” civil disobedience will follow.The organisers say the main focus of this weekend, however, is creating a welcoming space for people to come and protest about the climate crisis, with no disruption.“We want to bring people together, to create a space where people feel they can make their voices heard,” said a spokesperson for XR. “This is not going to be about disruption, it’s about bringing more people and more big groups together – unions, social justice groups, environmental groups, some of whom have never worked together before. People don’t need to glue themselves to anything, just come and join us.”There were particular concerns that the London marathon might be interrupted, but the organisers of both events say they have agreed to coexist peacefully, although it is still possible that smaller activist groups or individuals may choose the marathon as a target.Environmental groups in the UK have struggled with a reputation for being dominated by white, middle-class people for a couple of decades, but XR has been partially focused on improving the diversity of the movement in the last few months. The coalition includes unions, environment groups, social justice groups and some businesses; among the signatories are Keep Britain Tidy, Avaaz, Friends of the Earth, Ecotricity, Patagonia and Cafod.On Friday there will be pickets outside various government departments in Westminster, and on Saturday a large family-friendly march is planned. Sunday will see action at the Home Office, and on Monday the groups plan to hold a “What’s Next” assembly.Dave Timms, the head of political affairs at Friends of Earth, said the organisation had been delighted to sign up. “We’ve had huge amounts of interest and enthusiasm from our members and local groups for this. There is a real appetite to get out there.”He said the timing was important, coming in advance of the latest Public Order Act, which has raised huge concerns about the right to protest. “The powers to stop and search that are included in that bill could potentially have a real chilling effect on protest. We need to show we can still get out there in the face of an unprecedented assault on our civil rights,” he said.Jemima Hartshorn, of Mums for Lungs, one of the organisations that has signed up to support the protests, said: “We know that the majority of people feel very passionately and strongly about the climate crisis. And our pollution and health crisis is a microcosm of the climate crisis more broadly – too much transport, not enough biodiversity, burning trees.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In New Zealand, Restore Passenger Rail, another JSO sister organisation, on Wednesday began a new phase of actions. And in New York City, disruptive climate street protests are expected on Saturday under the banner Rave Revolution.Big protests are also expected in France over the weekend, where Les Soulèvements de la Terre, a federation of environmentalist groups that fought pitched battles with police last month around a new reservoir project, will camp out at the site of a proposed new road project close to Toulouse."

        "text": "Below the downs, across Milking Parlour and Trenchfields – two fields named during the second world war – the oilseed rape has been harvested, leaving the fields like folds in a discarded tweed jacket. The unharvested standing crop next door is blackened by desiccation from glyphosate, a last chemical dousing to make the crop more palatable and even for the combine.The evening before, we watched the combine at work. At 9pm, and with several more hours of cutting, threshing and carting to do before forecast rain, the machine was an awesome sight. Coming up the tramlines with the roar of a billion bees, lamps blazing through a swirling cloud of apocalyptic grey dust, it set our hearts racing.I wondered what the soldiers rehearsing D-day in these fields – or the dairywomen and workers at harvest – would recognise here, when these fields took on their modern incarnation. The earliest combine harvester (a secondhand Massey Harris Bagger, driven by a woman) wasn’t employed here until 1953. And oilseed rape was unfamiliar until the 1970s and 80s (although it was grown from the 19th century to produce lubricating oil for steam engines and oilcake as a byproduct for animal feed).Today, rapeseed is ubiquitous in our kitchen cupboards as vegetable oil, despite being a tricky crop to grow; an array of fungicides, herbicides and pesticides is required to keep away the cankers, weeds and cabbage stem flea beetle.Stubble after the harvest near Inkpen, Berkshire. Photograph: Nicola ChesterWhat might surprise them the most are the buzzards and kites (rare or extinct in their time) that have gathered to glean injured or exposed prey from the brassica stubble. I watch seven kites floating, tilting, the notch on the inside joints of their wings giving them an elegantly ragged insouciance. Bulkier, darker buzzards patrol below them, skimming the ground. A little copse reverberates with the plaintive mewing of their offspring.On the field margin, knapweed seedheads, emptied of their down, shine like tinfoil, smoothed by the back of a teaspoon into silver suns. They match the shellac gleam of a buzzard’s underwing as it turns, stalls and drops.I watch the kites hunt their own shadows over the tweedy, chaff-strewn ground, and almost miss the buzzard as it flies up with what is unmistakably – even at distance – a large grass snake, dangling like an upside-down question mark from its talons.

        "text": "Children whose mothers are exposed to toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” during pregnancy run an increased risk of low birth weight as well as obesity and high body mass index later in life, an effect similar to prenatal exposure to tobacco, new research finds.The low birth rate effects of some PFAS have been previously established, but the study tracked 1,400 kids and found higher BMIs and more incidences of obesity in those ages two to five. The “low birth weight-high obesity risk paradox” was previously associated with tobacco smoke exposure during fetal development.“Something similar is going on with PFAS,” said Joe Braun, a Brown University researcher and study co-author.Chemical industry used big tobacco’s tactics to conceal evidence of PFAS risksRead morePFAS are a class of about 15,000 chemicals often used to make products resistant to water, stains and heat. The compounds are ubiquitous, and linked at low levels of exposure to cancer, thyroid disease, kidney dysfunction, birth defects, autoimmune disease and other serious health problems. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally degrade in the environment.A recent review of published research found PFAS in umbilical cord blood in all approximately 30,000 samples collectively checked in the studies.Though previous research found evidence suggesting the chemicals are linked to obesity early and later in life, including some research from the new study’s authors, the findings were generally inconclusive. The authors say the new research is more definitive because it included a larger sample size, greater geographic coverage, longer timespan and a wider range of exposure levels.As with tobacco smoke exposure, babies who are born underweight due to PFAS exposure can experience a rapid catch-up in weight, but not height, and the weight gain happens earlier than for children who will be a normal weight, Braun said.The precise reason PFAS cause these issues is not known for certain, said Jamie Liu, a Brown researcher and study co-author, but she added she suspected the chemicals affect DNA methylation.The methylation process is related to how the body produces cells, which all have the same DNA. Methylation is part of the mechanism that creates different cells – it determines which cell is an eye cell and which is a kidney cell, for example.During prenatal development, DNA methylation is one of the “switches that tells the body ‘this is how life is going to be on the outside’”, Braun said.The authors last year examined markers of DNA methylation in white blood cells and found PFAS exposure seemed to change how the body metabolizes energy from birth up to 12 years of age, which could affect growth.“PFAS seem to have a programming effect … that lasted for up to 12 years,” Braun said. Overall, the research found about a 12% increase in the likelihood of obesity among PFAS-exposed fetuses.Those who are exposed can mitigate the effects later in life through regular exercise, Braun said, but it is difficult for mothers to protect themselves and their fetuses because PFAS are so widely used. The US government estimates the chemicals are in 98% of Americans’ blood, and they often have long half-lives, so PFAS from an exposure years before a pregnancy could still harm a fetus.But, broadly speaking, people can take some steps to reduce PFAS exposure, Braun said. That includes filtering water – the chemicals are thought to be contaminating drinking water for more than 200 million Americans. Indoor dust is another major exposure route, and using a vacuum cleaner that has a Hepa filter can remove contaminants from the indoor environment, Braun said.Food represents perhaps the most significant exposure route, in part because the chemicals are frequently used in food packaging. Eating fresh foods that are not in packaging and pursuing a balanced diet could be beneficial, Braun added.“Those are probably the three best things you can do to hedge your bets,” he said."

Judged by a panel of 30 industry experts, this year’s fashion designer award was given to Christopher Esber, who made his on-schedule debut at Paris fashion week last month.A garment’s label tells you where it was made – but what does it reveal about its environmental impact?Read moreWillow has experimented with an alternative model in a pilot program in Melbourne called the Future from Waste Lab. At the lab, discarded clothing is washed and then repurposed into new garments. This creates “a circular link between the end of life and new material”. She said treating discarded fashion items as their own form of virgin material was “really the most sustainable way to be producing and sourcing” in fashion now.Melanie Levis was concerned with a different kind of circularity, after accepting a lifetime achievement award on behalf of her father, Rod Levis. Seeing her father receive the same award once granted to Carla Zampatti was “just the most beautiful circle in the industry”, she said.Rod Levis is the chairman of Cue Clothing, and Carla Zampatti was one of its earliest designers. The 81-year-old businessman, who began the high street brand in the youthquake of 1968, was not well enough to attend. But noting that Zampatti’s children, Alex Schuman and Bianca Spender, were also present, Melanie Levis said she felt proud to attend, “on behalf of the beginnings and of the pioneers in the industry”.On being raised in the fashion industry, Levis said: “I think at the time you take it for granted and then when you grow up as a teenager, you realise how cool your parents are.”In addition to its high street retail presence, Cue is one of the largest remaining onshore manufacturers in Australia, although their ability to produce domestically has been waning in recent years.

        "text": "Sometimes known as “the world’s loneliest orca”, Kiska the killer whale spent more than four decades in captivity at MarineLand, a theme park in Niagara Falls, Canada.For the last 12 of those years, despite wild orcas being social and intelligent animals that live in tight-knit family pods that hunt together and communicate through underwater clicks and calls, Kiska swam alone, in a featureless tank, with no calves, mate or mother by her side. She was the last captive orca in Canada.In one of the last recorded videos of her, she drifts listlessly in aquamarine water as a boy behind the glass wall tries to get her attention. “Kis-kaaa! Kis-kaa! Kis-kaaa!” he calls as the whale floats by, seemingly oblivious.But while the Ontario government’s announcement that Kiska had died in captivity last week, reportedly from a bacterial infection at an estimated 47 years old, was received with widespread grief, marine activists also credit the whale with inspiring tangible change in protection for marine animals.Kiska’s death comes four years after Canada passed bill S-203, banning the captivity and breeding of whales, dolphins and porpoises. Although the new law was too late for Kiska – individuals already in captivity were excluded from protection – activists say her story was instrumental in drawing public attention to the plight of captive marine mammals.There’s very little positive to take away from Kiska’s death … but at least she will be recognised as the lastPhil Demers, campaignerSince the bill, campaigners had been working hard to free Kiska, protesting on the streets of Niagara Falls, lodging legal complaints and drafting plans to secure her release from MarineLand.“When I heard that Kiska died, I just bawled, which I almost never do,” says Camille Labchuk, executive director of the Toronto campaign group Animal Justice.“It’s frustrating for so many people because it felt like we were so close to being able to get her out and she just couldn’t hold on long enough.”Captured off Iceland along with Keiko, the orca in the film Free Willy, in 1979, Kiska was soon transferred to MarineLand, where the two orcas lived together. Keiko was later sold to a Mexican entertainment park, then finally rehabilitated and released back into her Icelandic home waters.Kiska swims in her concrete tank in Niagara Falls last month. Photograph: Phil Demers/@Urgenseas/ReutersKiska, however, remained at MarineLand, where she gave birth to five calves, none of which survived. Her final tank mate was Ikaika, son of Tilikum, the whale that killed three people and featured in the 2013 documentary, Blackfish.“There were times when we had to separate them because Kiska needed a break,” says Christine Santos, a former trainer turned activist who worked closely with the two whales. “She just wanted to get away from this young male who just kept going at her.” In 2011, Kiska got her reprieve when Ikaika was flown back to California and his original owner, SeaWorld. No replacement was brought in for Ikaika and so began Kiska’s long period of isolation.For years, accusations of substandard animal care dogged MarineLand. In 2012, the Toronto Star published a series of stories in which eight former staff members, including Santos and her partner, Phil Demers, alleged that poor water quality and insufficient staffing caused animal suffering at the park. Lawsuits flew back and forth between activists and the theme park, and the government launched various investigations.Since January 2020, Ontario’s Provincial Animal Welfare Services has inspected MarineLand 160 times.In a statement, MarineLand said its “marine mammal care team and experts did everything possible to support Kiska’s comfort and will mourn her loss”, and did not return requests for comment.Ships are turning whales into ‘ocean roadkill’. This AI system is trying to stop itRead moreKiska’s health appeared to be declining in her final years. In the summer of 2021, Demers posted the video of a listless Kiska as the boy calls to her, then in October another of the orca bashing her head against the walls of her tank.Efforts to free Kiska at the time failed. A proposed whale sanctuary in Nova Scotia has not become operational, while plans to move her to an aquarium with other marine mammals did not materialise.Animal Justice is calling on the Ontario government to release the results of Kiska’s postmortem examination, and Demers is pushing for the remaining animals at MarineLand – including belugas, dolphins and sea lions – to be removed.“There’s very little positive to take away from Kiska’s death, but a lot of animals have died similarly, whereas at least she will be recognised as the last, and the orca that largely created and inspired bill S-203,” says Demers."

        "text": "George Monbiot’s statement that “taking out pipelines, refineries, abattoirs, coal plants and SUVs is morally justified” by comparison to the liberation struggles of colonised peoples is based on a fundamental misreading of the historical and social context of those events (I back saboteurs who have acted with courage and coherence, but I won’t blow up a pipeline. Here’s why, 29 April).This is not a novel view; it is a point well made already by Nafeez Ahmed in his critique of non-violent direct action. Anti-colonial resistance in India, for example, originated from within the oppressed communities themselves. Their aim was to force the British state to respond with such violence that the brutality of the colonial regime became apparent to the majority of the British people, whose tacit consent had been necessary for the continuation of the colonial enterprise.No such context exists today. All of us in the global north are complicit in, and beneficiaries of, the fossil fuel economy. To take it upon yourself to resort to the violent destruction of vital infrastructure, with who knows what consequences for those who depend on it, you must have a degree of moral certainty – I would use the word fanaticism – which I certainly do not possess.I agree with Monbiot that the tools of democratic change have been blunted and bent out of shape by years of subversion by vested interests. They still remain, however, our only hope of solving our differences without recourse to violence. In the current social and political context, once embarked on a path of violent disruption, we would unleash the very “war of all against all” that democratic politics seeks to protect us from.Kevin MiddletonStanford in the Vale, Oxfordshire George Monbiot is right to warn against using violence and direct action in the struggle against climate breakdown. Sabotage strengthens policing, security services and surveillance, as well as driving a wedge between activists and the public. It diverts campaigners from politics into dealing with the judicial system.Monbiot is also right that our best hope is “social tipping” to widen support for systemic change. But we also need to use our democratic rights to build political support for the tough actions needed to tackle the climate crisis. Politicians fear losing votes more than anything else: this fear gave us the Scottish parliament, the referendum on Brexit, and the abolition of the fuel tax escalator, following direct action by lorry drivers in 2000. Local elections this week and the general election enable us to vote for decisive action on climate. We also need to lobby parties, councillors and MPs to address the existential threats to humanity. Titus AlexanderGalashiels, Scotland I entirely agree with George Monbiot about the need to support only what one is prepared to do. I am prepared to be a surreptitious seed spreader personally, having realised that it does not need to be expensive, as dandelion seeds, among others, are freely available. However, I dream of wider action. Offers from conservation groups/activists to rewild all tedious lawns outside public and institutional buildings? Illicit organised wilding, including tree planting for the uncooperative? Fundraising to add to the variety of planting? Fruit tree planting on verges and at the side of roads?I should exempt only farmland. May golf courses be turned back into forests, orchards and fruit farms. And, while damaging concrete and paved infrastructure is no doubt criminal, where the concrete and asphalt submit to natural forces of erosion, why not plant there?

        "text": "The energy regulator is to introduce rules designed to kick out “zombie” wind and solar farms from the lengthy queue to connect to Great Britain’s electricity grid.Ofgem hopes to speed up the process of hooking up new energy projects to the electricity network in the face of a backlog that is deterring investment and Britain’s attempts to switch to clean energy.At the moment, projects are connected to the grid on a first come, first served basis – leaving some developers waiting up to 15 years to produce power for the country’s homes and businesses.UK subsidies for offshore windfarms likely to increase amid rising costsRead moreIn certain cases, developers have been granted a contract allowing them a grid connection for a location, but have not progressed the project, possibly with the aim of selling the connection on at a later date. The projects include onshore and offshore wind, solar farms and battery storage businesses, and the first terminations are expected next year.The regulator said on Monday it would hand National Grid’s electricity system operator (ESO), which controls the process, the power to terminate projects that were not progressing against their specific milestones, including proof of funding or planning permission. It will apply to all projects with a connection date after November 2025.The ESO has said that between 60% and 70% of projects in the queue “ultimately fail to materialise or connect”. The number of projects waiting in line rose from 600 in May to 1,000 by September.The average time between requesting a connection and being offered one has increased from 18 months in 2019-20 to five years in 2023.Ofgem said that, if the current projects in the queue were all developed, it would generate 400 gigawatts (GW) of power, far outstripping the UK’s existing power capacity of about 65GW. However, more than 40% of that is in held-up contracts with connection dates of 2030 or later; some are as late as 2037.Eleanor Warburton, an Ofgem director, said: “The transition to net zero demands urgent changes to the electricity connections system – or we cannot unlock investment, speed up network build and accelerate new technology.“This is a big step towards phasing out the first come, first served queueing system. We want new power on the grid as quickly as possible, so if you’re ready, you can connect sooner.“If you’re not ready and are blocking the progress of others, you’ll be removed – you can’t sit on the queue with no consequences.”Julian Leslie, the chief engineer and head of networks at the ESO, said: “We warmly welcome these new rules approved by Ofgem enabling us to proactively terminate zombie projects in the connections queue.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is now expected to offer higher subsidies to the companies, which have faced rising costs.A package of measures to speed up grid connections is expected to be announced in the chancellor’s autumn statement on 22 November.Separately, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) said on Monday that the oil market remained “healthy”, despite a weakening in prices to $82 (£67) a barrel for Brent crude from highs of nearly $98 in late September.The group of oil-producing nations said strong Chinese imports and “robust” trading were supporting the market despite concern about economic growth and demand.

        "text": "Environmental groups in Canada are taking legal action against the country’s environment minister, arguing his delay in protecting old growth forest is harming the critically endangered northern spotted owl.In February, Steven Guilbeault said he would recommend an emergency order after determining the species was facing “imminent threats” to its survival.Emergency orders are a powerful tool under Canada’s endangered species legislation and have been used only three times in the country’s history, including once by Guilbeault. They grant the federal government jurisdiction over decisions typically reserved for a province, including the ability to dictate which forests are off limits to logging.Decades of old growth clearcutting have wiped out much of the northern spotted owl’s habitat in British Columbia, leaving the wild population in Canada at just one female, down from about 40 breeding pairs in the 90s.The minister initially determined that old-growth logging must stop within an area of the Spô’zêm Nation territory, including the Spuzzum and Utzlius watersheds, as well as a further 2,500 hectares (6,200 acres) of forest habitat at risk. But in the four months since Guilbeault announced plans for an emergency order, environmental groups say he has failed to follow through.“The minister is legally obligated to make an emergency order recommendation to cabinet to protect this iconic species – any further delay is unacceptable,” said Rachel Gutman, a lawyer with Ecojustice, which is representing the advocacy group Wilderness Committee. “With the logging season upon us and only one owl remaining in the wild, the failure to immediately protect the species’ remaining habitat risks the extirpation of the spotted owl from Canada.”Only one spotted owl remains in the wild in Canada. Photograph: Jesse Winter/The GuardianJoe Foy, a spokesperson for Wilderness Committee, said: “We’ve been insanely patient as we wait for the federal government to put their spotted owl recovery strategy in place and for the minister to recommend an emergency order, even though we’ve watched spotted owl numbers dwindle down extremely low. But the situation we’re in now is alarming.”In late May, Foy and Geoff Senichenko, a mapper with Wilderness Committee, travelled to areas in British Columbia that the federal government had previously indicated would become “critical habitat” as part of its spotted owl recovery plan, a powerful designation which would halt logging under federal law.Foy alleges logging companies have raced to harvest those areas before they are formally designated off limits. “We saw areas that had been mapped as critical habitat already logged, we saw areas where there’s critical habitat being logged right now. And we saw areas of standing forest marked as critical habitat in the federal government’s draft spotted owl recovery plan that are pending approval for logging,” he said.“We’re in a very dire situation. The forest is broken and the federal government has a plan to fix it. But if those forests are logged, it would make the recovery of spotted owls highly unlikely.”In an interview with the Guardian in April, Guilbeault said he was wary of recommending the emergency order to cabinet because of concerns it could “seriously degrade” the relationship between the province of British Columbia and the federal government, stalling efforts to save a number of other species, including caribou.‘All I see are ghosts’: fear and fury as the last spotted owl in Canada fights for survivalRead more“The reality is, it’s a last-resort measure. Because once you do that, there is no more collaboration,” he said. However, he added that fear of damaging the relationship between federal government and the province “can’t be used as an excuse for not acting”.Last month, two spotted owls from a breeding programme released into the wild were found dead, highlighting the steep challenges in recovering the species. Environmental groups say more protection is needed, arguing the fate of the small predators is a glimpse into the health of the region’s ancient rainforests.“It’s up to citizens to try to do the right thing,” Foy said of the lawsuit. “Clearly, we’ve tried everything else. And it’s our responsibility to try this too.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"

        "text": "The climate crisis is moving into uncharted territory as much of the northern hemisphere endures a blistering heatwave, many countries are deluged with rain, sea surface temperatures reach new heights, and Antarctic sea ice new lows. A number of climate records – some unofficial – have tumbled in recent weeks.Many factors have combined for this to happen, including climate change but also the El Niño weather event, and the northern hemisphere summer.00:03:10What is supercharging the global heat? – video explainer“The northern hemisphere has a lot more land, it means this time of year just tends to be hotter globally than in southern hemisphere’s summer,” says Dr Kim Reid from Monash University.“And so this combination of this background warming from global warming, El Niño and the fact that it’s the hottest time of the year for the globe means that we’re just seeing all these records tumbling, all at once.”While the UN’s World Meteorological Organization and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have both declared a Niño is in place, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology has so far held back from declaring one, saying the atmosphere is not yet giving the typical signals.This heatwave is a climate omen. But it’s not too late to change course | Michael E Mann and Susan Joy HassolRead moreThe record for global average temperature has been broken a couple of times in the past few weeks, according to a model of average air temperatures at two metres, created by the NOAA. Although, as this data is derived from a model and not direct observation, it is not an “official” climate record.The model is based on observational data from weather stations, balloons, satellites and other sources and allows climate scientists to get an idea of the temperature over a wider area and create an average for the entire globe.The chart above shows the global average derived from the model, but maps also show the positive temperature anomalies – the difference between current temperatures and the long-run average – spread across much of the Earth’s surface in June.High temperatures were recorded across much of the world in JuneEven as the air temperatures have been elevated, the NOAA models show sea surface temperatures are also higher than in recent decades. Monthly data shows that the temperature anomaly has been positive and on an upward trend for decades.The ocean stores a lot of the excess heat from global heating – up to 90% in recent decades.“Because we’ve had La Niña the last few years, a lot of the heat has gone into the ocean,” Reid says. “It’s sort of been hidden from us at the surface for a bit. And now as we’ve flipped from La Niña into El Niño, a lot of this ocean heat is now rising up to the surface.”chartWhile the air and sea surface are seeing greater than average heat, new records are being set for sea ice in Antarctica – for how little there is. The lack of sea ice extent is continuing a trend – a new record has been set several times over the past few years.Satellite data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center shows that not only is 2023 a significant outlier, 2022 ended with some of the lowest sea ice extents on record. But the gap to the long-run average for this time of year appears to be getting larger.”But Reid warns that the Earth – the climate – is a complex system, with many moving parts. What is happening to sea ice in Antarctica, for instance, also has to do with winds, storms and pressure systems.“We’ve got, of course, the background climate change, we’ve got the seasonality, the fact that it’s summer, the fact that it’s now El Niño, and then there’s also what we call effects from aerosols. So these are tiny particles like sulphur dust, sea salt, that can reflect incoming solar radiation. And [all this] can control the planet’s temperature.”"

        "text": "Exposure to air pollution harms our health, and reducing air pollution saves money. These were the two of the main messages from last month’s conference of air pollution scientists in Brussels. Held just a few hundred metres from the European Commission, it sent a clear message to EU policymakers about the opportunities from adopting ambitious targets.Each year across the 27 EU member states about 412,000 people die early from particle pollution, but this is just part of the impact. Air pollution is also a factor in many of our chronic diseases; it harms our health from before birth, through childhood and into our old age.Prof Barbara Hoffman, of the University of Düsseldorf, said: “Air pollution at current European levels is not for free – it comes at great costs in terms of hospital care, loss of working days, work incapacity and reduced intelligence in kids. All this translates into a huge and preventable expense.”New EU proposals fall short of adopting World Health Organization guidelines but would reduce legal limits for particle pollution by 60% and cut the limit for nitrogen dioxide by 50% by 2030.Objectors often cite costs as a reason for not acting. Methods for calculating costs and benefits vary between countries but the overall message is similar. The benefits from reducing the health burden from air pollution are so high that these almost always outweigh the investment.The US Clean Air Act and amendments are estimated to have saved the lives of 230,000 Americans in 2020. Add in reduced asthma, emergency room visits and days away from work and education, and the benefits add up to more than 30 times the investment. For the EU’s proposal, the projected benefit is at least 10 times greater than the cost and could be as much as 35 times greater. Extra benefits will also come from less pollution damage to forestry and valuable farm crops.The UK’s government’s air pollution targets for England are less ambitious than the EU proposal. They have the same target for particle pollution, but aim to attain this 10 years after the EU. They do not include new limits for nitrogen dioxide. The estimated benefit is between five and six times greater than the investment.Prof Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, of Barcelona’s Institute for Global Health, said: “The new EU directive, with tighter limits could be the biggest health intervention for a generation.”The World Bank estimates that the health impacts of air pollution amount to 6.1 % of global gross domestic product. The EU has an opportunity to become a world leader in technology and actions for clean air.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Brazilian companies and slaughterhouses including the world’s largest meat producer, JBS, sourced cattle from supplier farms that made use of workers kept in slavery-like conditions, according to a new report. Workers on cattle farms supplying slaughterhouses earned as little as £8 a day and lived in improvised shacks with no bathrooms, toilets, running water or kitchens, according to a report from Brazilian investigative agency Repórter Brasil.Since 1995, the report said, 55,000 Brazilian workers have been rescued by government inspectors from “situations similar to slavery”. While the number of investigations has fallen in recent years – 118 workers were freed in 2018, compared with 1,045 a decade earlier – that does not mean the situation has improved, just that inspections have been reduced, it noted.JBS promised to control its entire supply chain by 2025. Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters“We see this as an urgent problem that the big companies have to resolve,” said Marcel Gomes, executive secretary of Repórter Brasil and the report’s editor.The report challenges meat companies such as JBS, which has faced criticism over its inability to control its supply chains of cattle farms in the Amazon.A series of investigations by the Guardian, Repórter Brasil, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and others have found the company bought cattle from so-called “direct supplier” farms that had sourced from “indirect suppliers” – farms that supply cattle to be fattened and slaughtered – that had been involved in illegal deforestation.In September, JBS promised to control its entire supply chain by 2025 – 14 years after it and other Brazilian companies Minerva and Marfrig originally promised to do so. The three companies signed a deal in 2009 with Greenpeace in which they agreed not to buy cattle from farms “engaged in slavery”. Similar deals signed with federal prosecutors stopped them buying from farms included on a rolling government “dirty list” for keeping workers in slavery-like conditions.Brazil meat giant JBS pledges to axe suppliers linked to deforestationRead moreIn August 2019, government inspectors found nine unregistered workers clearing pasture on the Copacabana farm in Mato Grosso do Sul state were being paid £8 a day, the report said. They lived in improvised shacks made of logs, plastic, palm fronds and corrugated iron without toilets, kitchens or running water. The farm and its controller, Fernanda Thomazelli, were later included on the 2020 “dirty list”. The farm had sold cattle directly to two JBS slaughterhouses in 2019 and 2020.In an out of court settlement with labour law prosecutors, Thomazelli’s father, José, representing his daughter, agreed to register the workers and provide proper living conditions. Notes from a meeting with prosecutors recorded he did not admit the existence of “work similar to slavery”. When contacted by the Guardian, he declined to comment and his daughter did not respond to an email.JBS said it blocked Copacabana and two other farms listed in the report as soon as they appeared on the “dirty list”, following protocols agreed with prosecutors. “We have a zero-tolerance approach to forced labour and also urge anyone who suspects or has evidence of individual or farm-level malpractice to report it,” the company said.Workers process meat on a production line at the Minerva plant in Barretos. Photograph: Bloomberg/GettyThe report also cited a farm in Tocantins state that sold to another farm in December 2018, two months after being included on the “dirty list” for keeping a 65-year-old worker in “deplorable conditions”. The second farm supplied a Minerva slaughterhouse in the state, the report alleges.Minerva, Brazil’s second largest beef exporter, said it never did business with the offending farm and that the direct supplier farm was “qualified” to supply cattle. The company is investigating the case. “If any irregularity is found,” Minerva said, “we will take appropriate action.” Minerva is testing a tool called Visipec to control indirect suppliers.Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

        "text": "Almost 2,000 locations across England, Wales and Northern Ireland have levels of air pollution that exceed safety limits, according to a pollution map released by campaigners.In 2017, the worst location for nitrogen dioxide pollution was Kensington and Chelsea, followed by Leeds and Doncaster.Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the most harmful pollutant gases, irritating the lungs and potentially causing breathing difficulties. Road traffic is a leading source.On Tuesday the mayor of London issued a high pollution alert for the capital as people across the UK basked in the unseasonably warm February weather. It was the first alert since last July, towards the end of a long heatwave and dry spell.London pollutionTraffic and other emissions from local sources were mainly to blame for this week’s dirty air, with only light winds to disperse them and air from the continent bringing further pollutants.In April the first ultra-low emission zone will come into force in central London. The scheme is expected to cut harmful emissions by as much as 45%, according to the mayor’s office.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said high levels of particulate matter in the air were also recorded in the past few days in the East and West Midlands. Other regions were also expected to experience localised pollution in hotspots, carrying on at least into Wednesday.The new map of nitrogen dioxide pollution limit breaches for recent years shows that Earl’s Court station in London was worst overall, with a recording of 129.5 micrograms per cubic metre, compared with the 40μg/m3 limit set out in the government’s air quality objectives.Earl’s Court station in London was the worst for pollution limit breaches, the map indicated. Photograph: Kevin Coombs/ReutersA monitoring station near the Ikea store in Brent, north London, recorded levels slightly above 100μg/m3 in 2016, while Kensington High Street, Euston Road and Strand in central London were all above 90μg/m3 in 2017.Air near Neville Street in Leeds was found to be just under the 100μg/m3 level, closely followed by two locations in Hickleton, Doncaster. Other hotspots included Brighton, Sheffield and Coventry, where the levels on Holyhead Road were found to be near twice the advised limit, at about 76μg/m3 in 2016.England pollutionFriends of the Earth, which mapped the sites and collated the data, said it was further evidence of the dire air quality across the country as a result of burgeoning traffic emissions and poor government controls on emissions sources. The group called for tougher action by ministers.Simon Bowens, a clean air campaigner at FoE, said: “It’s unforgivable that across the UK there are nearly 2,000 locations over air quality limits, leaving millions of us breathing dangerously polluted air. The government needs to step up and do more to help deal with this air pollution crisis. They can’t just carry on leaving the difficult decisions with local authorities, many of which are severely under-resourced.”London nurseries to get air purifiers after toxic air concernsRead moreHe said the map showed that air pollution was not just a problem for big cities. “Unacceptably toxic air can be found across much of the UK, even in smaller towns,” he said. “It is harming the health of people across the country and is especially bad for young children whose lungs are still developing.”Air pollution is known to shorten lives and reduce the quality of life for tens of thousands of people, and in recent studies it has also been linked to health problems from dementia to heart disease and miscarriage. Children are most at risk: exposure to air pollution when young can have lifelong effects as it can stunt the lungs and affect intelligence.A fresh inquest into the death of Ella Kissi-Debrah, a nine-year-old from south London, is expected to be asked to consider whether her death six years ago from an asthma-related seizure could have been linked to high levels of air pollution.The data used for the map was taken from the most recent annual air quality status reports that have been submitted to government, most of them from last year, with the results adjusted for distance and other factors. This article was amended on 27 February 2019 to make it clear that the data in the analysis covered England, Wales and Northern Ireland, rather than the entire UK."

In India, several regions were affected and 13 people died due to the heat at a public event outside Mumbai. The eastern Indian state of West Bengal closed all schools and colleges for a week.The study found that temperatures were at least 2C (3.6F) hotter in the region because of climate breakdown.If the global average temperature reaches 2C warmer than pre-industrial times, the April heatwave could occur every one to two years in India and Bangladesh, the study said. Currently, the world is about 1.1C to 1.2C (2F to 2.2F) warmer.“We see again and again that climate change dramatically increases the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, one of the deadliest weather events there are,” said Friederike Otto, a senior climate scientist at Imperial College London and one of the study’s authors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "The US Department of Energy has selected seven projects for a $7bn program to launch the development and production of hydrogen fuel, the White House announced on Friday.The Biden administration says the program will constitute a major boost to the country’s nascent clean hydrogen industry, helping it achieve its climate goals. But many climate advocates are skeptical that it will actually help reduce emissions.Unlike coal, oil and gas, when burned, hydrogen does not produce greenhouse gas emissions. It can be produced using carbon-free energy, but roughly 96% of it is currently derived from planet-heating fossil fuels – something the Biden administration hopes to change.“With this historic investment, the Biden-Harris administration is laying the foundation for a new, American-led industry that will propel the global clean energy transition,” said Jennifer Granholm, the secretary of energy, in a statement.The money will be awarded to proposed hydrogen projects on the Gulf Coast and in the mid-Atlantic, Appalachia, midwest, upper midwest, Pacific north-west and California. Dozens of regions competed for funds from the $7bn pot, set aside in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. On Friday, Joe Biden will travel to Philadelphia to promote the mid-Atlantic hub.The Department of Energy says it expects the funding to help cut 25m metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, the equivalent of removing 5.5m gasoline-powered vehicles from the road each year.But some experts say the new initiative could amount to little more than greenwashing. Though researchers agree that truly clean hydrogen, produced without fossil fuels, can fulfill certain crucial roles in hard-to-decarbonize sectors, including in the production of synthetic fertilizers and steel, studies have found it to be much less efficient for home heating and transportation than technologies such as heat pumps and electric vehicles.“Direct electrification and batteries offer so much more, and much more quickly,” Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, told the Guardian this year.Despite this, fossil fuel companies have spent years promoting hydrogen production as a catch-all climate solution. Some have used the hope of clean hydrogen to justify building more pipelines, claiming that they can be used to transport the climate-friendly fuel in the future.Climate advocates also note that hydrogen production, even when powered by renewable energy, can be highly water intensive. And since hydrogen is also a highly flammable and corrosive element, it can create risk for workers.Oil companies often say fossil fuels can power hydrogen production, so long as any emissions produced are trapped with carbon capture and kept out of the atmosphere.But carbon capture technology is not currently available at commercial scale, and a 2021 paper co-authored by Haworth found that using methane gas paired with carbon capture to produce so-called “blue” hydrogen for home heating could produce more climate-warming pollution burning gas, coal or diesel oil.“At face value – and according to the Biden playbook – the hydrogen hub grants aim to help transition the United States to clean energy,” said Marion Gee, the co-executive director at the Climate Justice Alliance, a national coalition of grassroots environmental justice groups. “In reality, they amount to another corporate scam, one that preserves and extends the life of the extractive economy and prevents the frontline communities most impacted by climate disaster from having input.”Julie McNamara, the deputy policy director of the science and climate advocacy organization Union of Concerned Scientists, said the administration should impose stricter regulations on the hydrogen hubs to boost community input and ensure only completely fossil-free projects receive funding.“Concerningly, today’s H2Hubs announcement advances multiple projects premised on fossil fuel-based hydrogen production and risky hydrogen end uses,” she said. “Billions of taxpayer dollars are at risk of perpetuating fossil fuel industry injustices and harms while subsidizing fossil fuel greenwashing.”"

Children play in fountains and people enjoy fountains in parks and squares, and they serve as meeting places.“Who knows? Maybe it’s time we turned greater Sydney into a city of fountains?” Calvert said."

        "text": "A diesel fuel spill that contaminated the water supply system of Germantown, Tennessee, has left residents unable to drink their tap water as the city’s public works crew rush to flush out the contaminated water.The city first told residents on 20 July that a spill at a treatment plant tainted the water supply system. The order came after residents reported a fuel smell in their water. Officials said that a generator at the plant spilled diesel fuel into a reservoir after the facility lost power during recent storms.They noted that 100 gallons of diesel contaminated about 4.2m gallons of water held at the plant.On Wednesday, many of the 40,000 people in the Memphis suburb of Germantown remained under an order to avoid using water for everything except flushing toilets. Officials advised using bottled water for personal use and the city has been distributing bottled water.Bottled water distribution will carry on until Friday. Cases are limited to one per car, ABC24 reports. Residents can also bring their own containers and fill them at Bailey Station elementary school.It was not immediately clear when the tap water would be deemed safe for use. Spokesperson Eric Ward said in an email on Wednesday that the Tennessee department of environment and conservation needs water samples to come back clear of diesel before the advisory is lifted.A small section of Germantown has been allowed to resume using water. The Daily Memphian reports that residents east of Forest Hill-Irene and residents in the Enclave and Lansdowne subdivisions have started to use water normally again.There have been no reports from officials about people getting sick.On Tuesday evening, officials said tests at the plant showed water there was clear of contamination and the city would continue testing the water and begin flushing its system. The announcement was framed by officials as good news – but it was not enough to lift the order.“We know this situation has been an incredible inconvenience, disrupting the everyday lives of our families and businesses. And we apologize for that,” Germantown’s mayor, Mike Palazzolo, said in a video message on Tuesday.On Wednesday, the Daily Memphian reported that the city had flushed 40% of its contaminated waters. It remains unclear when the majority of the town’s residents will have access to clean water, the outlet reports.Michael Wyrick, a 39-year-old accountant who lives with his wife and two daughters in Germantown, said living without tap water “has been an adjustment for sure”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added that there’s been a lack of communication from city officials since the spill.“They could’ve used some good advice on communications. They’ve not been aggressive, they’ve not been outgoing about it and maybe there’s reasons they can’t and legal issues … I understand all that but waiting 10, 12, 14 hours between communication?” he said.The Peace Tree United Methodist church in neighboring Collierville has offered hospitality rooms and showers to Germantown residents.“As our neighbors in Germantown continue to experience water restrictions, we want to make our facilities available to anyone needing to restock their coolers with ice and refill their water containers with potable water,” the church wrote on its Instagram page."

        "text": "The River Wye’s health status has been downgraded by Natural England, as wildlife charities accuse the government of failing to stop farming pollution harming the waterway.The government nature watchdog has updated the status of the river from “unfavourable-improving” to “unfavourable-declining”, meaning its condition is poor – and worsening.The assessment shows the river, which flows for 155 miles from mid-Wales to the Severn estuary in England, has experienced declines in key species such as the Atlantic salmon and white-clawed crayfish.Previous studies have linked its decline – the river has been pictured over the years going from clear and full of wildlife to the colour of pea soup – to intensive chicken farming on the catchment. This is because the poultry reared in the area produce large amounts of manure, which contains nutrients including phosphorus. Much of this is spread on the land, which can result in the phosphorus it contains entering the river.The Wildlife Trusts, which manages nature reserves across the Wye catchment, has expressed concern at the downgrading of its status and urged the government to take action.It is calling for ministers in England and Wales to place an immediate policy moratorium on any new or extended intensive livestock production units (poultry, cattle and pig) in the Wye catchment. It is also asking for farmers and supermarkets to work with nature charities to put an end to the pollution, and for farmers in the area to be rewarded for providing public goods and enabled to diversify into regenerative and sustainable methods of production which cause less pollution.Joan Edwards, the director of public affairs at the Wildlife Trusts, said: “That the Wye is in even worse condition now will come as no surprise to the people that love and live near it. But this new admission represents a shocking failure by the agencies and authorities in Wales and England that are supposed to protect this once beautiful river.“Wider research shows that farm pollution is the main cause of its decline – that’s why the authorities must enforce the law wherever the causes of pollution are clear. It’s time to prevent more chicken sheds from being built and ensure that all farmers are rewarded for nature-friendly, cleaner food production methods.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Bringing people together from the local communities, it is clear we have a common goal.

        "text": "Drax has received permission from the government to fit carbon capture technology to its wood-burning power plant, in a project that could cost bill-payers more than £40bn.The energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, on Tuesday approved the project to convert two of its biomass units to use the technology.Analysts have predicted that the revamp of the North Yorkshire site could be one of the most expensive energy projects in the world.The project could add about £1.7bn to energy bills every year if the company acts on plans to fit all four of its biomass units with carbon capture technology, or a total of more than £43bn, according to Ember, a climate thinktank.In addition, the government is expected within days to extend a lucrative bill-payer-backed subsidy scheme that last year paid Drax more than £600m to burn trees for electricity until the end of the decade.The decision is likely to anger environmentalists, who have campaigned against burning imported wood pellets and have opposed the multi-billion-pound subsidies paid to Drax over the past 12 years.The planning decision said the project would “make a meaningful contribution” to the urgent need for carbon capture storage infrastructure to support the government’s net zero ambitions. A separate decision about its subsidy payments will follow before 2027.Will Gardiner, Drax’s chief executive, said the planning approval “demonstrates both the continued role that Drax power station has in delivering UK energy security and the critical role it could have in delivering large-scale carbon dioxide removals to meet net zero targets”.A report commissioned by Drax has claimed that adding carbon capture to its biomass power units could save the UK economy up to £15bn between 2030 and 2050 when compared to other, more complex carbon reduction measures using biomass.Phil MacDonald, the chief operating officer at Ember, said the report ignored the “immediate real costs” of building the plant, which are likely to fall to taxpayers or energy users.“Over 20 years, this could make Drax’s BECCS plans one of the most expensive energy projects in the world, funded from bill-payers’ pockets,” MacDonald said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Using biomass with carbon capture, known as BECCS, would be create the world’s first “carbon negative power station”, according to Drax.The claims have been challenged by scientists and climate experts. The company’s green claims are also being scrutinised by the energy regulator, Ofgem, and the National Audit Office, which are undertaking separate investigations into the sustainability criteria of the government’s biomass strategy after fierce criticism by green groups.A government spokesperson said Ember’s estimates were “entirely speculative” as no decisions about the plant’s carbon capture technology, or additional subsidy, had yet been made.“Any potential support awarded to Drax would be subject to a value for money and affordability assessment and subsidy control considerations – ensuring that any tax- and bill-payer money is spent wisely,” the spokesperson said."

        "text": "Katie Mitchell’s new theatre production will arrive at the Barbican in London in April having already toured internationally without anyone involved getting on a plane or even crossing a border. The show, entitled A Play for the Living in a Time of Extinction, is an experiment in how theatre can be more sustainable. It is staged by a local creative team and features a different performer in each venue it plays.The idea took shape at Théâtre Vidy-Lausanne in Switzerland, where the British theatre director was due to stage a show. The French choreographer Jérôme Bel had recently announced that he would no longer fly, a decision Mitchell had herself made after working with scientist Stephen Emmott on Ten Billion, staged at the Royal Court in 2012. Mitchell and Bel began discussions with producers at Vidy-Lausanne about sustainable theatre in which, says Mitchell, “the artistic conversations were intersecting with budgeting and systems and structures as well”. The zero-travel rule is just one part of the initiative which is not a set-in-stone model but rather a way to prompt new ways of working on individual productions and within organisations.They still had to find a text. A Play for the Living in a Time of Extinction, by the American dramatist Miranda Rose Hall, came to Mitchell’s attention after it was shortlisted for the Susan Smith Blackburn prize. It’s a monologue about a stressed-out theatre worker called Naomi whose company, Zero Omissions, are touring a devised show called Climate Beasties.For a play that engages with environmental collapse and death, it is very funnyWhile conversations about climate crisis are happening on an organisational level, this doesn’t always translate into the work we see on stage, says Mitchell. Hall adds that she and her company had been “thinking a lot about what it would mean to generate a fictional narrative work that could attempt to grapple with the climate crisis using the tools of theatre”. For a play that engages with environmental collapse and death, it is very funny. Hall was intent on bringing some buoyancy to the character of Naomi: “Finding the humour in it is my way of being myself within the story.”Participating theatres in the play’s UK tour – including the Belgrade in Coventry, Theatre Royal Plymouth and York Theatre Royal – will be issued with a set of guidelines called a “touring score”. These state that the show should be off-grid and that the electricity must be generated during the performance. In Vidy, as in many of Mitchell’s previous productions, this was done using onstage bicycles pedalled by performers. The set and costumes should also be produced locally and the use of second-hand material is encouraged.The guidelines state that Naomi, who will be portrayed by Lydia West (It’s a Sin) at the Barbican run, should be played by a woman of colour or someone from an under-represented community in each iteration of the production. Each stop on the tour should also feature a local choir.‘I can’t just be quiet in the corner, accepting everything’: Lydia West on deep dives into roles – and waterRead moreAfter premiering in Lausanne in 2021, the production played various European dates including the Holland Festival and NTGent in Belgium. There was also a production in Taipei. In the UK, the theatre company Headlong will co-produce the tour.“Theatre about climate collapse can often be confused with activism, but it felt like they were taking these issues seriously, which triggered me as an artist and a person,” says Martha Balthazar, the young Belgian director behind the NTGent production. While she thinks it is essential “to keep having this conversation,” she found the lack of creative freedom frustrating at times and feels the project has some blind spots, particularly in respect to privilege. This is something Mitchell also acknowledges. “Zero travel is a privileged position for a lot of countries. We have to think sensitively and thoughtfully about the global south and how they might want to join the conversation,” she says.There have been some hard discussions along the way, says Mitchell. “It’s not been easy, but it’s been healthy.” And, given the experimental nature of the project, it is capable of evolving and absorbing feedback. “As a senior artist, I have a duty of care to put myself out there a bit,” says Mitchell. She and Bel are established enough to take these risks. After all, she says, “We’re part of the generation who created the problem.” A Play for the Living in a Time of Extinction is at the Barbican, London, 26-29 April. Then touring."

Their home, the country they paint, is currently underwater [from recent flooding]. Woodside like to slap their logo on everything while they spray their toxic emissions all over sacred rock art. We must stop any more industry on the Burrup, or soon there will be no art left.”Last year the WA Environment Protection Authority (EPA) advised the state government it should extend Woodside’s North West Shelf gas development in the Pilbara – reportedly Australia’s biggest polluting fossil fuel development – for a further 50 years until 2070.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "The initial expansion of London’s ultra low emissions zone (Ulez) for motor vehicles has brought notable benefits in reducing pollution, a study has found as the mayor prepares for a big extension to its boundaries.The report by officials at the Greater London authority and Transport for London could help Sadiq Khan counter a political backlash to the imminent further expansion.The report has been peer-reviewed by Dr Gary Fuller, an expert on urban pollution at Imperial College London. It calculated that since the zone was introduced four years ago, emissions of toxic nitrogen oxides, or NOx, particularly produced by diesel engines, are 23% lower across London as a whole compared with what would be their estimated level if the scheme had not been introduced, and 26% lower within the zone.Using the same metric, emissions of dangerous fine particulate matter, or PM2.5s, were calculated to be 19% lower than they would have been without the Ulez within its boundaries, and 7% lower across the whole city.The zone in which drivers of vehicles which fail to meet certain emissions standards must pay a daily fee, now £12.50, was first rolled out for central London in April 2019.In October 2021 this was expanded by several miles to the edges of the north and south circular roads. At the end of August the Ulez borders are due to be extended again, covering all 32 London boroughs.A number of Conservative MPs and some councils have objected to the new expansion, arguing that people in outer boroughs rely more heavily on motor vehicles for transport, and that it is unfair to ask those with older, non-Ulez compliant models to pay for an upgrade.Khan has insisted the health and environmental toll of pollutants and other emissions justifies the action, saying the new report showed it was “vital” to expand the scheme.The report offers evidence that the Ulez does not appear to, as some critics warned, simply push vehicles to drive around the edge of it, with boundary roads seeing concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, one of two contributors to NOx emissions, fall by between 19% and 27% compared with the projected case without the zone.The study also includes figures for absolute levels of pollutants over the course of the zone’s existence, but these can be more complex to analyse given external factors such as the impact of Covid, which saw motor traffic levels in inner London and thus emissions reduce sharply for a period.Additionally, emissions levels had been falling anyway before the Ulez was created, as newer, less-polluting vehicles emerged, meaning not all reductions can be attributed to the policy.On the impact of the 2021 expansion specifically, the report said that, on average, 74,000 fewer heavily polluting vehicles a day were being driven within the zone, a fall of 60%.Khan said the evidence of the zone’s effectiveness was “beyond dispute”. He said: “But there’s still more to do. Toxic air is a matter of life and death with around 4,000 deaths in London attributed to air pollution in 2019. It’s also stunting the growth of children’s lungs and causing people to develop life-changing illnesses, such as cancer, lung disease, dementia and asthma.”Fuller said the evidence he reviewed showed both the initial, central London Ulez and the 2021 expansion had “brought about measurable and sustained improvements to air pollution from traffic”.He said: “Many people fear that traffic will simply divert around low emission zones, worsening air pollution for those that live on the boundaries. However, data from London’s air pollution measurement network has shown that this has not happened. Instead, nitrogen dioxide alongside the North and South Circular roads has shown a strong improvement.“Many cities in the UK and around the world are looking to follow London’s lead. I hope that the evidence here will improve the design of similar schemes more widely.”"

Two separate appeals have been lodged to try to halt the works, which have already begun, and a demonstration has been called for 12.30pm on Saturday in Madrid Río. By Friday afternoon, more than 50,000 people had signed a petition to save the trees.“We only found out when they started to put the barriers up,” said Susana de la Higuera of the Pasillo Verde Imperial neighbourhood association.“By putting the station inside the park, they’ll have to cut down more than 500 trees in the Madrid Río park, which includes what was the historic Arganzuela park, which was planted in 1969.”‘We need trees’: green vision struggles to take root in Europe’s citiesRead moreDe la Higuera said the loss of the large London plane trees, which provide much-needed shade during the merciless Madrid summer, would be devastating for the community.“The people who are grandparents now took their children there and now they take their grandchildren there,” she said. “It’s also where the schoolkids hang out because it’s the only place where there’s really shade. But it’s a really popular park that’s used not only by people from Arganzuela, but also by people from all over Madrid. We just don’t understand this barbaric idea – there’s no other word for it.”Ecologists in Action said the metro works would represent “one of the greatest arboricides” in Madrid’s recent history.“The reasons for this decision seem to spring from the need to smooth out the management of the works and to reduce the effects on traffic as much as possible by moving construction away from the public thoroughfare,” it said in a statement. “This is further proof of the Madrid government’s disdain for our natural heritage.”Madrid city council referred the Guardian to the Madrid regional government, which is leading the metro extension. The regional government did not respond to the Guardian’s questions.Earlier this week, however, Madrid’s mayor, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, said “not a single tree would be lost” as laws required that the 1,027 felled trees be replaced by almost 20,000 new ones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": " Your article (Keir Starmer considers scaling back Labour’s £28bn green plans, 22 December) says: “Others in the party, however, want Labour to be ambitious and stick to its original £28bn pledge.” Britain is in a dreadful situation after 13 years of Tory mis-government. The public services are in a ruinous state; industries that have been privatised are failing. The country needs a person of integrity, vision and presence to lead Britain towards the kindly, efficient and flourishing country it could and should be. Keir Starmer has the qualities, the experience, sense of values and humanity to be that person.Yet he’s timorous, afraid that Rishi Sunak has begun to “weaponise” this “major Labour spending commitment”. Let Sunak weaponise the subject as much as he likes, Keir, but stick to your guns. Sunak is wrong, wrong and out of his depth, grasping at anything in his desperation to keep power.If Keir Starmer wins the next election he will have the opportunity to rebuild Britain. David CurtisSolihull, West Midlands The suggestion that Labour is considering further watering down its so-called green policies in order to “neutralise” Tory attacks is deeply depressing. The mere idea that such a ludicrous government that retains not a scintilla of respect or credibility has some kind of embargo on another party’s policies that are essential to meet the environmental and economic challenges simply brings into stark relief the malign, stultifying and reactionary effect of our sclerotic political system. Liz Truss was mocked as a lettuce; if Starmer can’t stand up to this “threat” then he surely deserves to be ridiculed as a chocolate fireguard. Neil BlackshawAlnwick, Northumberland I see that Labour is planning to ditch its commitment to address global heating and a sluggish economy. It seems that whenever under attack from the Tories and their friends and paymasters, Labour backs off for fear of losing votes. What exactly is Labour for? I don’t want headbangers of the left any more than headbangers of the right, but what I do want is some national leadership from Sir Keir Starmer, not just party leadership, especially for such an existential matter as climate change, never mind the cost of energy to households and businesses. I don’t recall such tentativeness from Tony Blair or Harold Wilson, for all their shortcomings.John FilbyAshover, Derbyshire Labour’s retreat on green policies confirms how difficult it will be to change people’s behaviour, even to protect the planet. As we saw with the minor issues surrounding the expansion of the ultra-low emission zone scheme in London, there will always be people opposed to the changes if they are affected. And in this case they were opposing policies aimed at reducing pollution to improve their own air!The Tories quite successfully opposed the plans, which encouraged more extreme people to vandalise cameras and equipment, all because a few thousand people would have to scrap their old, highly polluting bangers.So unless we can develop hard green policies with the agreement of at least the main parties, change will not happen. And even then there will be other groups ready to fight change. David ReedLondon Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, please click here to upload it.

        "text": "A Tory rebellion in the House of Lords could thwart Michael Gove’s plans to rip up pollution laws for housebuilders in England.The former minister Zac Goldsmith, who recently quit the government over what he termed Rishi Sunak’s “apathy” over the environment, and Sir John Randall, a former environmental adviser to No 10, have signed an amendment laid by the Duke of Wellington that would nullify the government’s plans.Last week, Gove and the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, announced plans to amend the levelling up bill, which would undo EU-derived rules stopping housebuilders from polluting sensitive areas. It would essentially force planning officials to pretend sewage pollution from new developments does not exist when considering applications for sensitive areas such as the Norfolk Broads and Lake District.The current rules aim to sustain “nutrient neutrality”, meaning no more nutrient pollution such as nitrates and phosphates enter important habitats in sewage from new housing. These nutrients choke rivers, filling them with algae and killing the life within.The duke’s amendment, which will be debated in the coming days, would “delete … the requirement placed on a local authority to assume that nutrients in wastewater would not cause harm to the environment”. This would effectively undo the government’s amendment and maintain the protections for rivers.Goldsmith is understood to be lobbying his fellow peers to back the duke’s amendment. Other signatories include the Green party’s Jenny Jones, and Kate Parminter of the Liberal Democrats.The Office for Environmental Protection, set up to replace the EU as a watchdog for environmental regulation in the UK, has said these rules are a regression in environmental standards and asked Coffey and Gove to appear in front of the House of Commons to explain themselves. Those who hoped Labour would undo this “regression” when in power were disappointed when the then shadow levelling up secretary, Lisa Nandy, indicated she supported the government position. It is unclear whether her replacement, Angela Rayner, does too.The Lib Dem environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, has reported the solicitor general and the prime minister to the ethics adviser for a breach of the ministerial code, claiming they have misled parliament by saying they would not degrade the environment.Farron said: “The prime minister’s contradiction on environmental protections is not only a grave concern for the environment, but also potentially a serious breach of the ministerial code.“Ministers are expected to provide accurate information. We need an urgent investigation into this to get to the bottom of whether the prime minister and solicitor general have knowingly misled the House of Commons.”A government spokesperson said: “We’ve always been clear we will never compromise our high standards and we are fully committed to our ambitious and legally binding commitments on the environment. The reforms we’ve set out will see us tackle pollution at source in a way that these legacy laws never addressed through a significant package to restore waterways and leave our environment in a better state than we found it.“This will see us more than offset the negligible impact of new homes on levels of nutrients, by doubling the investment for Natural England to tackle nutrients, bringing this to £280m, drawing up bespoke plans to restore nature in the most affected areas, and providing more support than ever to help farmers reduce pollution from essential agriculture.”"

        "text": "One of our era’s great and inconvenient truths is that global food production and the climate emergency are intimately linked. Drought, flood and other extreme weather events threaten farming ecosystems across the world. At the same time, greenhouse gas emissions from animal agriculture play a major role in global heating. We know that the default western diet, with its heavy emphasis on meat and dairy, is harming the planet. Eating habits in wealthy countries will have to change, and livestock numbers be reduced, if climate targets are to be met and vulnerable food systems saved.At the end of the month, this message will be heard front and centre in the next round of the UN climate negotiations. At Cop28 in Dubai, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization will foreground the need to transform patterns of consumption and production if the goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is to be met. The emphasis on the impact of food systems is welcome and overdue. For various reasons it has been badly neglected at previous summits.But while the science is stark and straightforward, the politics is anything but. Agriculture is a sector where economic interests overlap with cultural traditions, national identities and sentimental attachments to the land. It was telling that when Rishi Sunak was desperately searching for green policies to oppose this autumn, he chose to invent a fictional “meat tax” proposal to suit his purposes. Mr Sunak was nakedly and disreputably seeking to create net zero dividing lines ahead of the next election. But across the west, more principled politicians than him are struggling to show leadership on fraught and sensitive terrain.In the United States, Joe Biden has introduced new requirements to reduce methane emissions in fossil fuel industries, but they did not extend to the vast American beef industry. Last spring, the Dutch Farmer-Citizen Movement – set up in protest at government plans to reduce livestock numbers by a third – sent shock waves across Europe when it won regional elections. In Ireland, where farming makes up almost 40% of all emissions, proposals for similarly dramatic culls have been discussed behind closed doors in government, but not approved as policy. Compared with sectors such as transport and construction, the green transition in agriculture is notably underpowered.The drift must not continue. This month, Denmark’s climate minister called for EU farmers to pay for their greenhouse gas emissions through a form of trading scheme. New Zealand will price emissions from livestock farming from 2025 – the only country in the world to have committed to do so. These are moves in the right direction, but only if combined with a generous combination of subsidies, compensation and financial incentives for farmers to diversify. Similarly, persuading western populations to eat less meat will require imaginative, innovative political leadership. Any proposed “meat tax” will provide automatic fodder for the populist right. But if revenue from new pricing mechanisms is directed towards the popular cause of animal welfare and some form of climate payment to the less well-off, the politics might begin to look different.Changing the way we eat is an enormous cultural challenge, with huge economic implications. It cannot be done by stealth or diktat, or on the cheap. Nor can the task be swerved if sustainable farming is to flourish in the future. Governments must follow where Cop28 leads."

At the time of his death Dick was the most senior of the Royal Geographical Society’s 16,000 fellows.His research between the 1950s and 70s on field expeditions in the Sahel, Tibesti, the Kalahari and the Ethiopian Rift established the scale of climate change on African desert margins. He and his students made cutting-edge use of air photographs to map ancient sand seas around the Sahara and the Kalahari, showing massive desert expansion at the height of the last glaciation (20,000 to 12,500 years ago). Surveys of the fossil shorelines of ancient lakes showed the “greening” of the Sahara in the early Holocene (10,000 to 5,000 years ago).In the early 70s, when international attention was focused on the African Sahel by the tragedy of drought and famine, Dick’s research found a new and important policy audience, challenging glib Malthusian arguments about population growth and “desertification”. From the late 80s, Dick’s interests expanded to the environmental history of the Mediterranean, documenting the complex interplay between environment and peoples from the earliest times to the present.Dick Grove by an ancient spit and stromatolite bed at Lake Chew Bahir, Ethiopia, in the 1970s. Photograph: Andrew GoudieDick was born in Evesham, Worcestershire, to Christine (nee Hughes), a milliner, and Edwin Grove, a fruit and vegetable grower. In 1941, after attending Prince Henry’s grammar school in the market town, Dick went to St Catharine’s College, Cambridge, to study geography. From 1942 to 1945 he was a pilot in the Royal Air Force, serving primarily in Air Training Command in Canada. He returned to Cambridge, finally graduating with a first-class degree in 1947.He worked briefly for the Colonial Office in Nigeria on the problem of soil erosion, before returning to Cambridge as a demonstrator in the department of geography in 1949. He was appointed to a lectureship in 1954, and remained in Cambridge for the rest of his career, retiring as lecturer in 1982, although he continued as director of the Centre of African Studies in 1986. He was elected a fellow of Downing College in 1963, eventually serving as senior tutor and vice master.Dick was a true geographer of very wide interests. He was a somewhat diffident lecturer, but a highly stimulating supervisor and a generous colleague. An acute and wry observer of landscapes and people, he had a profound influence on science and on those he worked with and taught.He married Jean Clark, a Cambridge glaciologist, in 1954, and they had six children. Jean died in 2001 and their son Richard, a pioneering environmental historian, died in 2020. In 2009, Dick married Ann Round.She survives him, as do his children Jane, Lucy, Bill, Alison and Jonathan, 15 grandchildren and a great-grandchild."

They said they were called to Parliament House after the students unfurled banners, then “spoke to the teenagers and escorted them from the building”.The premier, Jacinta Allan, briefly thanked parliament staff for keeping MPs “safe and secure” but made no mention of the protest when question time resumed.“We appreciate their assistance for having our question time resume.

He did not give a reason for his departure and said he would be taking a break once he left the role. Judith Simon, Verra’s recently appointed president, will serve as interim CEO following Antonioli’s departure on 16 June.“The trust you placed in Verra and myself in my role as CEO has meant a lot, and I leave knowing we have made tremendous strides together in addressing some of the world’s most vexing environmental and social problems. Working with you on these important issues has been a great highlight of my career,” he said.The announcement follows a difficult period for Verra, which has seen the environmental integrity of their carbon standard satirised by the comedian John Oliver and journalistic exposés about the integrity of their carbon credit certification process.In January, a nine-month investigation by the Guardian, the German weekly Die Zeit and the investigative group SourceMaterial found Verra rainforest credits used by Disney, Shell, Gucci and other big corporations were largely worthless, often based on stopping the destruction of rainforests that were not threatened, according to independent studies. It also found evidence of forced evictions at a flagship scheme co-operated by Conservation International in Peru.Antonioli strongly rejected the findings of the investigation and defended Verra’s impact on the conservation of rainforests. The organisation is in the process of introducing new rules for generating rainforest carbon credits, with all projects set to be using the new system by mid-2025.Some firms are moving away from offsetting-based environmental claims, such as Gucci, which has removed a carbon neutrality claim from its website that heavily relied on Verra’s carbon credits.Scientists have called for the unregulated system to be urgently reformed to finance climate mitigation and forest conservation despite current concerns about integrity.Diego Saez Gil, the CEO of Pachama, a carbon offsetting firm that uses AI and remote sensing to verify and monitor carbon capture by forests, said he would like Verra to update its programmes with the latest science and techniques to improve integrity.“This is a pivotal moment for carbon markets. In order to scale the critical funding required for carbon sequestration at a planetary scale, we must ensure integrity, transparency, and real benefits for local communities and biodiversity. A new generation of innovative players is collaborating with standard bodies, academics, corporates, and communities, creating a new era of carbon markets that gives me hope,” he said.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"

Shocking, because it comes at a time when our vital public services are crying out for funding; alarming because, at a time when building bridges and serious cooperation are needed to address the existential climate crisis, we are going all out to intensify hostility with China and affirm the dominance of the west.The building of nuclear submarines will, of course, create employment, along with profits for the companies involved, and that is true of all the other armaments that are to be manufactured. But the arms industry consumes energy, and the emissions caused will drive climate change. War and its preparations are the planet’s greatest enemy. The equivalent resources put into building capacity for clean energy would be the means to end our dependence on fossil fuels and help protect our imperilled planet. Likewise, the rebuilding of our depleted diplomatic service could help build positive relationships rather than enmity.Diana FrancisBath The prime minister’s refreshed review of security and foreign policy notably goes out of its way to press the case for a domestic nuclear energy strategy (Sunak’s focus may be on China, but it’s Europe’s security that is vital for the UK, 12 March). In committing to “proactively look for opportunities to align delivery of the civil and defence nuclear enterprises”, a long-hidden military dependency on civilian infrastructures is at last openly admitted. Nuclear submarines would be too costly to build and maintain without an “industrial base” largely funded by elevated consumer electricity bills.Until now, these military costs have been invisibly subsidised, outside the defence budget, off the public books and beyond proper accountability. As a result, climate action has been less effective, more costly and slower than would otherwise be achievable by what the National Infrastructure Commission rightly identifies as more affordable and renewable alternatives. So this newfound candour is welcome. But is this military-nuclear empire bling worth this crippling cost? Now they are no longer deniable, perhaps the issues at stake can at last be democratically debated?Prof Andy StirlingUniversity of Sussex  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Trowland’s is thought to be the longest jail term handed down by a British judge for non-violent protest.This week Ian Fry, the UN’s rapporteur for climate change and human rights, said the lengthy sentences were a potential breach of international law and risked silencing public concerns about the environment.The letter, published on Friay, says that while banks and fossil fuel companies appear to face no legal sanction for making billions in profits from the destruction of life on Earth, governments are using all the powers at their disposal to crack down on peaceful protesters.“Rounding up people of conscience instead of charging the real criminals is the response of a political and legal system in steep decline, unable to cope or envision a way out of this urgent crisis,” it says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Chile has been among the worst affected countries with fires at the beginning of the year and now extended droughts. Cordero said Santiago was sweltering in its ninth heatwave since January and was expected to break the annual record of 10 heatwaves, set in 2020.Marcos Andrade, the director of atmospheric physics at the Universidad Mayor de San Andrés in La Paz, said the Andean plateau in Bolivia and Peru had also experienced “unusual” weather since the start of the year.“At Puno, on the other side of Titicaca Lake, they had their driest January since records began 59 years ago. In May, we had a storm with 20% of the usual annual rainfall,” he said. “The winter has also been unusually warm. We broke temperature records in some parts of the country.”He expressed concern that worse may follow as the southern hemisphere approaches its summer. “El Niño usually peaks at the end of the year.

Karla Beltrán, an environmental consultant, said that this year Buenos Aires had also recorded its highest ever temperature of 38.6C on 11 March, while the city of Mercedes in Uruguay hit a new peak of 40.5C.She said the heatwave was in line with the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which noted that the southern part of South America was particularly vulnerable to episodes of high temperatures. Studies have shown that northern South America, including the Amazon region and the Pacific coast up to the Atacama desert, will experience more frequent and intense heatwaves. “With the arrival of the El Niño phenomenon, it is expected that in the coming years this region will suffer an increase in the already high temperatures, making it necessary to take adaptation measures to avoid deaths and greater disasters,” she said.Chico Geleira, a professor of climatology and oceanography at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul and deputy director of Brazil’s Polar and Climatic Center, said the trends were concerning. “Without a doubt, the maximum temperature records in winter in Chile and, to a certain extent, in South America are atypical,” he said.“High pressure systems are more intense and persistent anomalies in the southern hemisphere, inducing hot air advection and/or directly generating temperature extremes. This high pressure will tend to remain and intensify in the coming decades with climate change.”"

If governments want to keep the 1.5C goal within reach while supporting energy security, doubling energy efficiency progress this decade is critical.“The findings of this report are a stark warning to the leaders gathering shortly at the Cop28 climate conference in Dubai that they all need to commit to stronger action on efficiency and to deliver on it.”The UK improved its energy efficiency by about 7% last year, according to the IEA, lagging behind neighbouring countries including the Netherlands, Ireland and France, which all reported an improvement of at least 12%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet, there is an answer. It’s nearly 10 years since Jonathan Porritt, in his book The World We Made, first called for the kind of carbon tax (now known more generally as climate income) that’s been implemented in four provinces of Canada. It’s basically a predictably rising price on all fossil fuels, with the funds rebated to citizens.The policy is redistributive, costs the government nothing and, unlike a one-off windfall tax, holds the promise of gradually pricing fossil fuels entirely out of the market. Meanwhile, it rewards alternative energy use and gives incentives to every kind of “green” innovation, initiative or behaviour.Studies show that this policy on its own could be a giant step to net zero, cutting pollution and climate costs, and paid for by fossil fuel companies themselves. Judy Hindley Co-founder, Citizens’ Climate Lobby UK Reading how the wealthiest tiny minority are responsible for huge impacts on global warming makes me wonder, why bother? The wealthiest 10% can afford to adopt any lifestyle and so have total control over whether, and how much, to pollute. And your research shows that they appear to choose to pollute as much as possible.Private jets, yachts, multiple large homes, gas-guzzling cars ... the list goes on. Add in the water companies discharging raw sewage into rivers, lakes and seas, and the environmental horror is complete. In the meantime, we’re encouraged to switch off lights, recycle the odd plastic bottle, compost bits of food waste and reuse our shopping bags.It’s so disheartening to realise that a lifetime of effort by households to reduce and recycle waste, save energy and reduce pollution will be wiped out in a matter of days by the world’s richest people just carrying on as usual. Why bother?Adrian WardLe Bez, France Re Jonathan Watts’ article (Indigenous solutions to the carbon divide, 22 November), I believe that the harnessing of Indigenous knowledge is an opportunity to learn from the colonial mistakes of the past. Rather than export our ideas on climate change, we must consider what we can gain from the lived experiences of Indigenous communities such as the Baniwa people in the Brazilian Amazon. Deforestation in South America has a detrimental impact on the climate, and through the destruction of these lands we could also be destroying potential solutions provided by the people who call it home. Matilda Michael-PhillipsNewcastle upon Tyne There are two separate issues at stake. One is inequality, which is grotesque, intolerable and has to be righted. The other is carbon emissions, which in principle can be cut independently and even in advance of progress on equality. If Elon Musk was to power his private jet and Jeff Bezos his superyacht with biofuels, their carbon emissions would be zero.

        "text": "The benefits of urban greening initiatives are increasingly well documented: they can help mitigate the effects of urban heating, and improve physical health and mental wellbeing. And even small greening actions in cities can significantly improve local biodiversity, new research suggests.Increasing the diversity of native plants in a single urban green space resulted in a sevenfold increase in the number of insect species after three years, Australian researchers have found.According to the study’s authors, there had previously been “little empirical evidence of how specific greening actions may mitigate the detrimental effects of urbanisation”.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nExisting research largely involved observational studies where urban greening had already taken place and “scientists come after the fact to see what’s happened”, said the study’s lead author, Dr Luis Mata of the University of Melbourne and a lead research scientist at Cesar Australia.The greening initiative was conducted on a small 195 sq m plot of land in Melbourne, on a site adjacent to a major road.“It was conducted in a very densely urbanised area, completely surrounded by streets and relatively tall buildings, and with limited access to surrounding green space,” Mata said.Even so, the team found “substantial ecological changes”, he said. “I think we found a really strong signal given the disadvantages of the site itself.”Researchers measured baseline insect numbers the year before greening began, when 12 indigenous plant species were introduced to the space, and subsequently conducted insect surveys for the following three years.They identified 94 insect species in total, 91 indigenous to the Australian state of Victoria. The researchers estimated that by the final year of the study there were about 7.3 times more insect species than originally present, even though only nine plant species remained.The team also found substantial increases in the number of predator and parasitoid insect species, which help to regulate populations of pest insects.“These are two key groups that provide a really good ecological signal that the trophic network and all the proper interactions are happening at the site,” Mata said.Prescribing nature: the restorative power of a simple dose of outdoorsRead moreThe researchers concluded that the study contributed a “critical evidence base to support future greening projects and the practice, policy and decision-making for protecting nature in urban environments”.“I think we’re starting to see some good greening outcomes that are being captured in policy, at least in principle,” Mata said. “Providing the evidence that greening is actually working is critical.”He hopes the study may motivate gardeners who are encouraged to plant native plants. “This could help provide the evidence that … no matter how small your intervention, you’re going to derive a good positive ecological outcome.”“We really need to do a better job valuing small, isolated green spaces,” said Prof Dieter Hochuli of the University of Sydney, who was not involved in the study. “The size of the area being studied is what many would typically claim doesn’t really serve as great habitat for things, and isn’t contributing much to biodiversity and its management. The data in this paper show otherwise.“It’s also a potent reminder of the importance [of] consider[ing] the quality of habitat, not just the amount of it. We often take simplistic approaches framed around planting more trees or creating more green space without considering how well it provides for species that might use it. It’s not a case of ‘any green will do’.”Can cities help us fight climate change? – podcastRead moreOther research in urban green spaces has linked sites with flowering plants to greater insect biodiversity compared to sites with non-flowering plants.“Small-scale greening can be highly beneficial to invertebrate communities, which in time can support higher order taxa like birds,” said Dr Caragh Threlfall of Macquarie University, who was not involved in the study.Increasing access to green and blue spaces and ensuring biodiversity-inclusive urban planning was agreed as one of the targets of the Cop15 summit last year.The research was published in the journal Ecological Solutions and Evidence."

        "text": "A white-tailed eagle chick has hatched in England for the first time in more than 240 years, and conservationists are “utterly elated” by the new arrival.White-tailed eagles were once widespread across England but were widely persecuted by humans, and the last record of a pair breeding was in 1780. Since 2019, 25 of these eagles, which are Britain’s biggest bird of prey, have been released to the Isle of Wight as part of an effort to bring back long-lost species.The male chick is the first offspring from that initial release. He is 12 weeks old and left the nest last week, although he will stay close to home and be fed by his parents for the next few months. The location of the nest has not been revealed to prevent disturbance.Steve Egerton-Read, a project officer for Forestry England, spotted the chick through his binoculars while standing in a neighbouring field. “We were utterly elated and gobsmacked,” he said. “I’ve known there was a nest there for a long time and I still don’t quite believe it’s happened.”White-tailed eagles, which have a wingspan of 2.4 metres (8ft), usually do not start breeding until they are four or five years old, and this pair are only three. They are the first to breed out of three pairs that have established territories in southern England.A white-tailed eagle after catching a fish. Photograph: Yonhap/EPAThe release is licensed by Natural England, the government’s wildlife agency. It follows a successful reintroduction programme in the Scottish Highlands, where white-tailed eagles started to be released in the 1970s after chicks were taken from Norway. There are now more than 150 pairs in Scotland.The reintroduction programme, led by Forestry England and the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation, involved moving birds south. The female of the pair was originally from the Outer Hebrides and the male from north-west Sutherland. More releases are planned this summer on the Isle of Wight.The birds are often called sea eagles because a huge part of their diet is fish. The Isle of Wight was chosen because the Solent offers plenty of food, as well as an abundance of cliffs and woodlands, providing potential nesting and resting sites. The birds have been spotted widely in England, from Cornwall to the Norfolk coast, and have even made forays across the Channel.The chick has been ringed and fitted with a GPS tag so ornithologists can track its progress.Roy Dennis, the founder of the eponymous wildlife foundation, described the development as a “significant milestone”. He said: “This is a very special moment for everyone who has worked on, supported and followed this groundbreaking project. Restoring a breeding population in southern England, where the species was once widespread, has been our ultimate goal. Many thought it was impossible but we knew food for eagles – fresh- and saltwater fish, cuttlefish, rabbits, hares and wild birds – was plentiful.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Two of the eagles from the 2019 release programme were found dead after being poisoned, police said in March. Out of the 25 birds released, 16 are still alive.A 2022 project to reintroduce the birds to the Norfolk coast was put on hold last autumn owing to opposition from farmers, shooting interests, and conservationists worried they would predate on wading birds, sources told the Guardian.Dennis said: “We still have a long way to go but the feeling of seeing the first pair reach this stage is truly incredible.”"

It can then be difficult and time consuming for conservationists to remove.Conservationists have found the aquatic plant in Bassenthwaite Lake, Derwent Water and, “to the dismay of local conservation bodies, it’s been recently found in Crummock Water – hitherto a pristine lake”, WCRT said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "London’s ultra-low emission zone expanded to the Greater London boundary on 29 August – making it the largest clean air zone in the world. Five million more Londoners will now breathe cleaner air – helping to prevent early deaths, protect children growing up with stunted lungs and reduce serious health issues such as asthma, cancer and dementia.Nine out of 10 cars seen driving in outer London on an average day already meet the strict emissions standards and their drivers will not have to pay the charge, but will see the benefits of cleaner air. The Ulez will also help to tackle climate change and congestion.I’ve been clear from the outset that the decision to expand London’s Ulez was a difficult one, but it was right for the health of Londoners and the future of our city. It is also crucial to ensuring London does its part to meet national air quality targets.We’re fortunate that London has a world-class public transport network but I completely understand there are Londoners who rely on their cars for some journeys. From passing my driving test a month after turning 17, to driving my new daughter home for the first time from hospital as a proud dad – driving holds many fond memories for me. Today I still enjoy driving my Ulez-compliant Golf GTI when I need it.But any transition to a greener city needs to be fair – and I know I need to do everything I can to help. That’s why, with zero contribution from the government – which has helped other cities around country – I’ve funded the UK’s biggest-ever scrappage scheme so that people can afford to change their vehicles, investing a further £160m to ensure thousands of pounds in support is available to every Londoner and small business who needs it. I’ve also invested heavily in new transport links in the expanded outer London zone, including the introduction of one million kilometres of additional buses, the new Superloop express bus service and opening the Elizabeth line.‘Green policies are the new Brexit’: a day on the frontline of London’s clean air zoneRead moreThe government has long recognised that clean air zones are one of the most effective tools we have for tackling air pollution in London. It is clear that the Conservatives’ obsession with London’s Ulez has nothing to do with the merits or demerits of the scheme and everything to do with their desperate attempts to cling to power by trying to weaponise green issues. Ulez was originally conceived by a Tory mayor, and is similar to other clean air zones being rolled out across the country with backing from the government. It is based on rock-solid science that is widely accepted both around the world and here at home. The government’s own figures, for example, show that air pollution is causing between 28,000 and 36,000 early deaths nationwide every year. About 4,000 of these premature deaths are in London.The Conservatives have overseen 13 years of decline – with soaring rents and mortgages, devastated public services, sky-high bills and the highest tax burden on working people in a generation. They have nothing to offer.That’s why they are desperate to confect a bogus war on the motorist. Division is both their strategy and overriding priority.Regrettably, fostering this type of damaging politics is more important to Rishi Sunak right now than the harm being done to our children’s lungs by air pollution or the decline forced on our economy because of their recklessness and incompetence.Serious, robust, reasoned discussion is essential in any democratic society, and something I have always welcomed.My objection is not to good-faith debate, but to the Tories sowing discord and division, in a desperate attempt to distract from the mess they’ve made of our country.Sadiq Khan is mayor of London"

        "text": "Litter is blighting the UK’s footpaths, with an average 41 pieces found a kilometre, according to a major study. Particularly frequently found brands included Lucozade, Coca-Cola, Red Bull, Monster and Walkers.The State of Our Trails report, conducted by Trash Free Trails, is the first UK study that aims to establish a scientific understanding of the environmental consequences of the tonnes of litter in our landscapes. It drew together more than 1,600 submissions by 4,500 volunteers and with the data the authors have estimated as many as 9.1m individual pieces of litter could be found across the UK’s 220,000km of public rights of way. The surveys took place between July 2020 and August 2023.Lucozade was the most frequently found brand of litter, according to the report. The authors said they thought this might be “because of its identity as a ‘sports energy drink’. Many recreational trail users will view their activity as a ‘sport’, requiring challenge and exertion, and therefore additional energy. This may be particularly prevalent among those who are relatively new and/or novice trail users, and/or beginners in the activities that they are participating in.”After Lucozade, the most commonly found brands were Coca-Cola, Red Bull, Monster, Cadbury and Walkers.A total of 26,106 of the 216,466 items of single-use plastics found in the report were drinks containers that would be eligible for inclusion in a deposit returns scheme, in which people are given a small sum for placing recyclable drinks containers in a special bin.Campaigners say there is no excuse for the government not to put in place a deposit returns scheme across the UK. There is one planned for England and Scotland by 2025, but there have been years of delays for both. The English scheme was first announced by Michael Gove in 2018. The scheme currently will not include glass containers.The report authors say the word “pollution” should be used rather than “litter” because “there is clear and growing evidence that this human-made detritus is harmful to the health of the ecosystems that it escapes into. This is the definition of pollution, and we should not avoid it any longer.”They add that people litter partly because they feel disconnected from the landscape, so “we believe that outdoor education can no longer be an optional frill alongside the mainstream curriculum. The time has come for students, pupils and educators to be in, with, and for nature as part of their journey through the system.”Trash Free Trails’ communications manager, Rachel Coleman, said: “We believe the negative impact litter is having on our ecosystems is one thing to get motivated by, but knowing the impact it has on ourselves and our enjoyment of the outdoors –that’s something policymakers and single-use product manufacturers can’t ignore.“This isn’t just about reducing litter any more. This is about a complete transformation of our relationships to these environments which are central to our sense of identity and community. If we don’t work to better protect them, who will?”A spokesperson for Suntory, which makes Lucozade, said the company wanted an end to littering and supported the introduction of a “well-designed deposit return scheme” across the UK. “We agree that we have a responsibility to help manage where our packaging ends up, which is something we already do through the Packaging Recycling Notes system and report on with Extended Producer Responsibility.” This article was amended on 10 November 2023 to add a response from a spokesperson for Suntory."

        "text": "Disposable vapes are behind a dramatic rise in fires at recycling plants over the last year, raising the risk of a major blaze releasing toxic fumes and polluting air, industry experts warn.Recycling firms are now dealing with so many vapes that they are struggling to insure their facilities. Some are now using artificial intelligence to detect vapes and their lithium-ion batteries, as well as installing thermal imaging cameras and automatic foam jets.The hazardous material dealt with at waste and recycling plants means they can potentially cause fires similar to 2020’s Bradford tyre fire which burned for a week and forced 20 schools to close and required every firefighter in West Yorkshire.Around 1.3m single-use vapes are now thrown away each week in the UK – an extraordinary rise since the first was sold in 2019 – and many are dumped by the roadside or in general waste. They contain lithium-ion batteries, which easily catch fire if broken, and some vapers have suffered life-changing injuries after theirs have exploded.Research by Material Focus, a non-profit organisation which runs the Recycle Your Electricals campaign, found that more than 700 fires in bin lorries and recycling centres were caused by batteries that had been dumped into general waste.Grundon, which recycles around 80,000 tonnes of household and municipal waste a year, has seen an increase in the number of disposable vapes being picked up by road sweeping vehicles, whose circular brushes usually collect leaves and stones.“They’re sold as disposable so people just throw them on the floor,” said Owen George, division manager for Grundon. “We didn’t see any about a year or so ago, but now they’re everywhere. We probably pick out 100 to 150 on an eight-hour shift. And they’re just the ones we catch.”The ones they don’t catch can end up in their non-recyclable waste stream with items such as Pringles cans, plastic wrappers and disposable coffee cups. These are chopped and packed into bales, a process that can break open a lithium-ion battery, which can then easily catch fire. Grundon has had three or four fires in the past year alone at just one site.Some disposable vapes at Grundon waste management recyling plant in Slough. Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer“We’ve managed to put them out, but the frequency is really growing,” George said. “It’s not just us – it’s affecting everyone in the industry.”Grundon has installed fire detection equipment costing about £250,000 at each of its facilities. “We’ve put in thermal-imaging cameras and, in some places, we’ve got automated cannons that lock on to the fire and hit it with water and foam to put it out.”Insurers have become reluctant to cover the waste industry because of the fire risk, with premiums growing and expensive fire safety systems now a requirement. Artificial intelligence is another option.About 70% of the recycling facilities market in Europe is operated by companies who now use AI developed by Greyparrot.“We have a box that has a camera inside and we take continuous images of the waste stream, then use AI to detect and analyse those images,” said Mikela Druckman, Greyparrot’s chief executive.I tried to properly recycle a disposable vape. It did not go well | Emma SnaithRead moreThe system can recognise 67 types of material which can then be sorted – iron and steel can be picked up magnetically, while lighter PET plastic bottles can be blown off with a burst of air.“We’re doing several projects, mainly in Austria but now also in the UK, where we’re identifying batteries in the waste stream,” Druckman said.Justin Guest, co-founder of Archipelago Eco, which invests in recycling technology, said that banning vapes would be “a blunt instrument”, adding: “It doesn’t solve the problem because it’s not just vapes – there are batteries in so many things now. People will always get stuff and throw it away.“There will be some other consumer craze that comes along and these materials will always find their way into the waste stream. So you need safeguards, and you need technology to solve that problem.”About 138m single-use vapes are now sold in the UK each year, containing enough lithium for about 1,200 electric vehicle batteries. This article was amended on 15 May 2023. An earlier version said that 70% of UK recycling facilities now use AI developed by Greyparrot; it is 70% of the recycling facilities market in Europe that is operated by companies who use this AI."

The ballot box will be more powerful than disruption, 6 October). I understand his reasoning about the Tories’ cynical strategy of using protest as a divisive vote winner. I understand why he’s prioritising climate over economic issues (though the two are of course deeply interrelated). This is indeed a highly important election. Its outcome will contribute significantly to whether humans, and many other species, will survive beyond the next few decades. Politics doesn’t get any more epic than that.However, Vince doesn’t apply the same logic in his statement that “a vote for anyone other than Labour, or no vote at all, is a vote for another Tory government”. Such a suggestion is worse than incorrect, it’s dangerously counterproductive. A Labour vote in constituencies where another progressive candidate has the most support will help the Conservative candidate win.Vince might do well to look at what South Devon Primary group is doing: engaging in a process to ensure the most popular progressive candidate is identified to reduce the risk of wasted votes and ensure the incumbent Tory loses their seat. The more constituencies that adopt a similar approach, the fewer seats the Tories will win. Fund the Labour party if you like, Dale, but South Devon Primary’s intelligent, pragmatic and democratic approach is more worthy, and needing, of your unequivocal endorsement.Gill CoombsMelksham, Wiltshire I am delighted to hear that Dale Vince is withdrawing support from Just Stop Oil. As a rational person I am in 100% agreement with the group’s aims, but its methods are actively counterproductive. You win an argument by making friends, not with aggression. And contrary to its claims, I would say that kettling people indiscriminately in their cars on a motorway, for example, is not a peaceful act.Mr Vince now realises what was always true: antagonising random members of the public is not going to change any government policy, but will make people angry and, for some, that anger will be directed against your aims as well as your movement. A voting drive to get Labour into power on a green mandate is a more positive strategy, and I wish him every success.Jake PrimeDartford, Kent I wholeheartedly agree with Dale Vince’s decision to concentrate his efforts on supporting Labour to end this destructive period of Conservative rule. I still count myself as a climate campaigner and activist, but unfortunately protest, especially by Just Stop Oil, has got us nowhere. In fact, it has sadly fuelled the Tories’ narrative of irresponsible anti-British “woke” people (us) and responsible, patriotic, upright citizens (them). The Just Vote campaign is definitely the way ahead for a constructive vital future free of “business as usual”.Emily ThwaiteRedmarley, Gloucestershire Can I be the 94th person to point out Dale Vince’s political naivety? To state “Labour is green” is seriously wishful thinking, and in some constituencies like ours, a vote for Labour would mean the Tories would definitely get in. Vote for Labour by all means when it will work, but in the meantime vote tactically to get the Tories out.Nick FrancisBath Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

        "text": "Henry Jephson was wandering around the countryside near Bristol during a Covid lockdown when his eye was caught by the ghostly appearance of a lion’s mane mushroom, its shaggy fronds hanging across a tree trunk.Jephson, the head of research at the Bristol Fungarium, knew he was looking at something rare and special. A staple of traditional Chinese medicine, the lion’s mane is also native to the UK, but is under threat. The “absolutely enormous” specimen spotted by Jephson was the first to be seen in south-west England in eight years.Little did he know then that the fungus would change the focus of Jephson’s work. He is now working with Natural England and the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) to get native mushrooms back into England’s woodlands. He helps run a mushroom farm, which has pivoted from growing oyster and shiitake mushrooms for restaurants, to conserving native fungi and creating health supplements from them.Lion’s mane is so rare that it is illegal to collect it from the wild, and it must be left undisturbed. Jephson was happy to admire it on his walks around the farm where he found it, pleased it was thriving in the wild.So he was shocked one day to see the landowner had felled its host tree. Speaking at the Oxford Real Farming Conference, he said: “The mushroom was smashed all over the ground in big soggy pieces. And so finding ourselves in a slightly unique situation because they’re illegal to collect, we picked up a solid lump of lion’s mane and took it back to the mushroom farm and started trying to get a clean culture of it.”Jephson has cloned the mushroom and is keeping its culture going at the farm. He also spoke to the landowner, who was unaware of the rare nature of the fungus, and he has left the tree stump alone, with lion’s mane still growing on it.This led the fungarium down the path of keeping native mushrooms alive. “It was finding the lion’s mane that really got us down that path of cloning rare mushrooms. And now people have been approaching us wanting natural strains.“Natural England and RHS Wisley [have] slightly different projects, and are using our strains to experiment. Wisley are interested in the insects that feed on mushrooms, so have been growing our strains at their site on logs in their garden to monitor the insects which come.“Natural England have several strains of native mushrooms that they want to be putting into woodland. They want to track how spores are travelling through woodland, but also to encourage deep rot fungus. So certainly mushrooms break down different parts of the trees, and we want, in order to encourage biodiversity, to have mushrooms that are good at breaking down.”Rare fungi are not just at risk from unwitting landowners and their axes – there are fears that spores from commercial farms could be spreading into the wild and affecting native mushrooms.“Mushroom farming is getting more and more popular, which is great,” Jephson said, “but all these commercial strains coming in, all these spores being put out in the environment, we just don’t know what they’re doing to local ecology.“I was talking to someone at a truffle festival a few months ago, and they were saying they found yellow oyster mushrooms. And they started in the summer growing on a hay bale. And yellow oysters are an exotic species. They are just not endemic, it was in the middle of nowhere.“She didn’t know if there was a mushroom farm nearby, but I bet there was one somewhere around there, or even a grow kit that someone had been growing in a windowsill, and these yellow oyster spores found their way out into the environment, on to a hay bale.”Native, wild mushrooms could be better for people’s health than commercial strains, Jephson said: “The commercial strains have been selected for high yield, fast growth. Our mushrooms are the opposite. They’re growing in ugly lumps. They grow incredibly slowly. They’re really picky about conditions. But they taste amazing, and our UK strain of lion’s mane has been tested for medicinal compounds in it, and the wild clone has 30% more beta glucans than the commercial strains.”"

Tests on the animals show that the cats’ genetic diversity is so low they will become locally extinct within the next 30 years unless there is urgent intervention.Historically lynxes have ranged across the expanse of Eurasia, but the elusive animals have come under intense pressure in many countries from habitat loss, inbreeding, poaching, and traffic collisions.In the 18th century, lynxes vanished from France entirely. After a re-introduction project in Switzerland in the 1970s some Eurasian lynxes moved across the border to France and re-established themselves in the Jura mountains. But the population failed to reach sufficient numbers to make it stable.Rewilding: should we bring the lynx back to Britain?Read moreScientists at the Centre Athenas, a wildlife protection centre in eastern France, collected 88 DNA samples from injured, dead, or orphaned lynxes between 2008 and 2020 and were able to analyse 78 to form a picture of the population’s genetic health. To avoid distress to the animals the team did not obtain samples from healthy wild lynxes.The tests revealed an alarming lack of genetic diversity. Although researchers believe there are more than 120 adult lynxes in France, the population has a level of diversity equivalent to only 38 animals. “This population has lost a lot of genetic diversity since it was reintroduced in Switzerland,” said Nathen Huvier, an author on the study. “If no new genetic material is reintroduced this population will go extinct, once again, in less than 30 years.”Writing in Frontiers in Conservation Science the researchers describe how the DNA from the lynxes reveals a devastating level of inbreeding, with two mating cats now extremely likely to be closely related.“A lack of genetic diversity can reduce the fitness of the individuals, generate diseases and reduce the ability of the individuals to adapt to environmental changes,” Huvier said. A population that presented those characteristics “was not able to evolve” so was vulnerable to collapse, he added.As an apex predator the lynx was a keystone species in the local ecosystem, Huvier said. One way to bolster the population’s genetic diversity was to introduce more lynxes from healthier groups, such as those in Switzerland or Germany. But such introduction projects were politically difficult, Huvier said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

At the same time the researchers want to see strict enforcement of poaching laws, and road signs warning drivers of the presence of lynxes to reduce the number killed by traffic.“We want this work to support action for lynx conservation,” said Huvier. “Reintroduction, replacement of poached lynxes, and exchange of orphan lynxes between care centres, are the best short-term solutions for this population to remain alive, and it will give it a chance to develop and connect with other populations in Europe.”"

        "text": "Planting more trees could mean fewer people die from increasingly high summer temperatures in cities, a study suggests. Increasing the level of tree cover from the European average of 14.9% to 30% can lower the temperature in cities by 0.4C, which could reduce heat-related deaths by 39.5%, according to first-of-its-kind modelling of 93 European cities by an international team of researchers.The lead author, Tamara Iungman, from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, said: “This is becoming increasingly urgent as Europe experiences more extreme temperature fluctuations caused by climate change.“We already know that high temperatures in urban environments are associated with negative health outcomes, such as cardiorespiratory failure, hospital admission, and premature death.” Her team wants to influence policymakers to make cities greener, “more sustainable, resilient and healthy” as well as mitigating climate breakdown, she added, since heat-related illness and death are expected to present an even bigger burden to health services over the next decade than cold temperatures.The researchers used mortality data to estimate the potential reduction in deaths from lower temperatures as a result of increased tree coverage. Using data from 2015 they estimated that out of the 6,700 premature deaths that year attributed to higher urban temperatures, 2,644 could have been prevented had tree cover been increased.The cities most likely to benefit from the increase in tree coverage are in south and eastern Europe, where summer temperatures are highest and tree coverage tends to be lower.In Cluj-Napoca in Romania – which had the highest number of premature deaths due to heat in 2015, at 32 per 100,000 people – tree coverage is just 7%. In Lisbon, Portugal it is as low as 3.6% and in Barcelona its 8.4%. That compares with 15.5% in London and 34% in Oslo. Study co-author Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, a researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, said the team picked 30% as that is a target that many cities are currently working towards. He said there was no need for buildings to be razed and replaced with parks, since there is enough space to plant more trees in all the cities the team looked at. He praised initiatives such as the EU’s 3bn trees plan, and the UK government’s proposal to ensure every home is within a 15-minute walk from green space, though he noted that policymakers must ensure trees are evenly distributed between richer and poor neighbourhoods.He added that cities which are “too car-dominated” should consider replacing asphalt roads, which absorb heat, with trees. Planting more trees in cities should be prioritised because it brings a huge range of health benefits beyond reducing heat-related deaths, he added, including reducing cardiovascular disease, dementia and poor mental health.Prof Yadvinder Malhi, professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study, said:“More than half of the world’s people live in towns and cities, so trees are going to be critical in making urban areas resilient to climate change and improve urban environments. Urban trees bring many co-benefits beyond climate change adaptation: many studies show just seeing and smelling trees benefit health and wellbeing, as well as enhancing urban biodiversity. But most tree cover is found in wealthy towns and neighbourhoods, so enhancing urban tree cover can reduce this inequity and particularly reduce the high vulnerability of poorer neighbourhoods to climate change.”"

A large amount comes from food and drinking water. Every route through which people ingest more PFAS is undesirable, including via sea foam.”He said no measures were needed regarding sea swimming since levels in the water were “a lot lower”. The RIVM said in a press release that it was unclear what the presence of the chemicals in foam meant “for the health of … swimmers, surfers, or people walking on the beach” due to a lack of data on exposure and acceptable risk levels.According to the Dutch study, which measured foam where available, “just as much if not more PFAS occur in Dutch sea foam as have been measured in Flemish sea foam, with the exception of one sample from Knokke in which very high PFAS concentrations were found”.PFAS are used in everything from waterproof clothing and cosmetics to firefighting foam and pizza boxes. Some are banned but there are concerns about environmental levels because the carbon-fluorine bonds that make the chemicals so useful also resist degradation. Last month, it was revealed that 17 of England’s 18 water companies found them in drinking water sources, including the widely restricted chemical PFOS in raw, untreated water at 18 times the limit for drinking water.Last year, the RIVM notes, the Dutch government tightened drinking water limits for PFAS after they were found to be “more dangerous for health than previously thought”.Flanders advises not playing in sea foam, not ingesting it, and washing after a day at the beach. The EU is considering large-scale restrictions on PFAS."

These are sawsharks and they use their formidable headgear to slash through shoals of fish. The moustache is a sensory device that helps the sharks detect prey.“Sawsharks are something extraordinary,” says Simon Weigmann from the Elasmobranch Research Laboratory in Hamburg, Germany.Details of the unique tooth structure of a Kaja’s sixgill sawshark. Photograph: Simon WeigmannUntil recently, scientists knew of eight species of sawshark, including one that has six gill slits in the side of its body. “This is unusual among sharks,” says Weigmann – as most sharks have five gill slits. With the help of fishers in Madagascar and Tanzania, two more species of sixgill sawsharks have come to light.Q&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world’s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth – and how much there is to protect. Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Long before western scientists named them, people in fishing communities in south-west Madagascar already knew about metre-long, sixgill sawsharks and called them vae vae. In 2017, Malagasy fishers gave two of the saw-like snouts (called rostra) to Ruth Leeney, a biologist visiting from London’s Natural History Museum. Realising they were something different, she sent them to Weigmann. He tracked down more preserved specimens that had been sitting on shelves in museums, and realised they belonged to a distinct species of sixgill sawshark.Specimen of a young female Kaja’s sixgill sawshark. Photograph: Simon Weigmann“Formerly, we thought that we just had one species occurring off South Africa, Mozambique and Madagascar. Now we know Madagascar has a different species,” says Weigmann.It’s important just to give the species a name, to bring attention to itSimon WeigmannThe name he picked for the scientific literature is Pliotrema kajae – Kaja’s sixgill sawshark – after his young daughter who watched on with great interest while he examined the preserved shark specimens at home. Kaja also means warrior in Frisian, a west-Germanic language, which Weigmann thought was appropriate given sharks’ weapon-like snouts.A specimen of a third species of sixgill sawshark came to Weigmann after colleagues visited a fish market on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar. He named this one P annae, after Kaya’s cousin Anna.Something that sets these species apart from previously known sawsharks is that their moustaches (technically known as barbels) lie closer to the tip of their snouts, but Weigmann doesn’t yet know the relevance of this.Discovered in the deep: the squid that makes a decoy out of its own skinRead moreSimilarly, there’s no obvious explanation for why these sawsharks have six gill slits. Out of the more than 1,000 species of sharks and rays, only a handful have six or seven gill slits.Radiographs of the heads of three Pliotrema species. Photograph: Simon WeigmannThe three species of sixgill sawsharks live in different parts of the Indian Ocean. The original species, P warreni, lives off South Africa and southern Mozambique, down to about 900 metres. Kajas have been found between 200 and 300 metres underwater off Madagascar and on the submarine Mascarene plateau that stretches between Seychelles and Mauritius. Annas have so far only been found off Zanzibar, in much shallower waters of between 20 and 35 metres.“It’s important to give the species a name, to bring attention to it,” says Weigmann. The next steps will be to work out just how threatened the species is and whether it needs protecting."

Photograph: Royal Zoological Society of Scotland/PAThese eggs hatched into caterpillars and then pupated into adults, producing a further 497 eggs. From these, 160 caterpillars were released into the wild.The first moths from these caterpillars were found in light traps by conservation scientists monitoring the site.Dr Tom Prescott, the head of conservation for Butterfly Conservation Scotland, said: “I was peering in the moth trap and I could see one on an egg carton in the trap. I couldn’t quite believe my eyes – it was very exciting.“We hope this is just the start of the moth becoming established at this site – it shows that the habitat is correct, and we hope the population will thrive and become sustainable there.”Conservation scientists want to spot some female moths at the site during the species’ short flight season of a couple of weeks but the RZSS said “painstaking” captive breeding would continue for some years.Breeding moths will be carefully paired and managed to maintain their genetic diversity while conservationists also work with landowners to create other suitable sites with lots of young aspen shoots for further releases and to encourage the species – not thought to be particularly mobile – to naturally spread.Dr Helen Taylor, the conservation programme manager at RZSS, said: “This is a really important and exciting step in our efforts to save dark bordered beauty moths, but there’s still a long way to go.“We have made a long-term commitment to help improve the conservation status of dark bordered beauty moths and ideally we would like to see successfully reintroduced, self-sustaining populations at multiple sites to safeguard the future of this stunning, but little-known moth. That’s going to take a few years, but this is a brilliant start.”The moth is one of a number of endangered invertebrates found in the Cairngorms that conservationists are seeking to revive, including the silver stiletto fly, the pine hoverfly and the small scabious mining bee.Taylor said: “All insects play vital roles in the ecosystems they live in, from pollination to waste recycling. Without these often overlook animals, ecosystems start to fall apart. Working with big, fluffy, charismatic animals is also important, but if we want healthy ecosystems to release animals like beavers and wildcats into, then we need to look after little guys like dark bordered beauty as well. I’m really glad that at RZSS we are working at both ends of that scale.” This article was amended on 26 July 2023 to clarify that the people in the second photograph are from the dark bordered beauty steering group."

        "text": "The world is likely to face major disruption to food supplies well before temperatures rise by the 1.5C target, the president of the UN’s desertification conference has warned, as the impacts of the climate crisis combine with water scarcity and poor farming practices to threaten global agriculture.Alain-Richard Donwahi, a former Ivory Coast defence minister who led last year’s UN Cop15 summit on desertification, said the effects of drought were taking hold more rapidly than expected.“Climate change is a pandemic that we need to fight quickly. See how fast the degradation of the climate is going – I think it’s going even faster than we predicted,” he said. “Everyone is fixated on 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels], and it’s a very important target. But actually, some very bad things could happen, in terms of soil degradation, water scarcity and desertification, way before 1.5C.”The problems of rising temperatures, heatwaves and more intense droughts and floods, were endangering food security in many regions, Donwahi said. “[Look at] the effects of droughts on food security, the effects of droughts on migration of population, the effect of droughts on inflation. We could have an acceleration of negative effects, other than temperature,” he said.Poor farming practices were not helping, he said. “The degradation of soil comes with bad habits, and the way we do our agriculture will lead to degradation of the soil. When the soil is affected, the yield is affected,” he said.Donwahi called on private sector investors to get involved and take advantage of opportunities for turning a profit. “The private sector has an interest in agriculture, and the better usage of the soil. We’re talking about [improving] yields. We’re talking about agroforestry, which is another way the private sector can have a return on investment,” he said. “We have to be innovative, to find new vehicles for finance.”Governments around the world signed a treaty pledging to combat desertification in 1992, alongside the UN framework convention on climate change, which is the parent treaty to the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and the UN convention on biodiversity, which aims to safeguard species abundance.But the desertification treaty gains least attention, and last year’s Cop15 on desertification went largely unnoticed compared with the climate Cop27 and the biodiversity Cop15 last December. Desertification Cops are held less frequently than climate summits: the next desertification conference will be held in Riyadh in December 2024, while the next climate summit, Cop28, will be in Dubai in late November.Donwahi said the world could not afford to ignore desertification. “We need to solve all the problems together. Desertification and drought leads to climate change, leads to loss of biodiversity. And when you have climate change you have droughts, floods, storms.“It’s not only the poor countries, everybody is in the same boat [on food security]. Climate change, droughts, storms, floods don’t know any boundaries, they don’t need a visa to go into a country.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It’s a continent where you have the most natural resources. The people who have the finance should help the people who have the natural resources.

It’s good for our wellbeing, our pride of place, for climate resilience and of course for nature’s recovery. Yet far too many people are deprived of its benefits. That’s why the trust is working with partners to invest in urban green space, and calling on others, including the government, to do the same.”The London Blossom Garden at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Stratford, east London. Photograph: James Dobson/National Trust ImagesIn Manchester last year, the trust transformed Castlefield Viaduct into a “sky park” where people can connect with nature in the heart of the city. The trust also acquired Crook Hall Gardens in Durham, which according to the plans will be “the gateway to a green corridor connecting the urban heart of Durham with the countryside on its fringes”.RSPB to give young people free access to its nature reserves in ‘youth revolution’Read moreThe charity is planting blossom trees in urban locations including London, Plymouth, Nottingham, Birmingham and Newcastle, and is part of a coalition forming 18 community organisations across the UK to create people-powered plans for nature in their neighbourhoods, which are mostly in urban areas.The pocket-park garden, which will be shown at the Royal Hospital Garden in west London next spring, has been created in honour of the National Trust’s founder, Octavia Hill, who tried to improve access to nature for the people of the UK. Founding the charity in 1895, she said she believed that “the healthy gift of air and the joy of plants and flowers” were vital in everyone’s life.Ann-Marie Powell, the garden’s designer, said: “In honour of Octavia Hill, we’ve created a place to sit in, a place to play in, a place to stroll in and a place to spend the day in. It is a place of refuge, a place to withdraw from personal challenges and the everyday. In this space, surrounded by wildlife, your spirit can be nurtured and revived.“The garden also shows that the parks, verges and gardens of our cities and towns present a huge opportunity to increase plant diversity and provide habitats and food for wildlife, including pollinators. Many people think of biodiversity as a luxury – a nice-to-have – but it’s the engine that produces everything that we consume. When it is diminished, everything loses out.”The garden is laid out as a series of “outdoor sitting rooms” – a core idea from Hill – where each individual garden compartment has its own atmosphere. It will feature reclaimed brick, timber, stone and thatch, sourced from National Trust places. All plants are peat-free and are climate-change resilient, including the trees. It is an urban community wildlife garden set in a brownfield site, which Powell hopes can be emulated by garden designers across the country for the public realm.The National Trust ‘sky park’ at Castlefield Viaduct in Manchester. Photograph: Annapurna Mellor/National Trust ImagesAndy Jasper, the National Trust’s director of gardens and parklands, said: “What we wanted to do was ask: if Octavia Hill was alive today, what would concern her? Without a doubt, she’d want to provide access to nature for urban communities, because we believe gardens and green space have the power to transform lives in so many ways.“We hope everyone will come away from this garden with an appreciation of Octavia Hill, what she stood for and how important she has been to the formation of the National Trust. We remain inspired by the role she played and we believe that gardens can continue to address the biodiversity crisis.”The trust said Hill’s mission remained relevant today, as its research showed one in three people in Britain still did not have access to nearby nature-rich spaces. While celebrating Hill’s legacy, the garden also aims to inspire people to create innovative gardens that connect people with the beauty and complexity of the natural world."

        "text": "The pesticide companies Bayer and Syngenta have been excoriated in a European parliament hearing after failing to disclose studies on the brain toxicity of their products.European regulators said the companies had breached legal obligations and behaved unethically. MEPs questioning executives from the companies said their actions had been “outrageous” and represented a “scandal”. The companies rejected the accusations and said they had provided all relevant studies.The withholding of nine brain toxicity studies from European regulators over the last 20 years was revealed by the Guardian in June, reporting findings from Swedish academics. They discovered that these toxicity studies had been submitted to the US pesticide regulator but not to the EU authorities.“These studies are performed in order to protect our children and grandchildren from effects on brain development,” said Dr Axel Mie, of Stockholm University, who led the research.He told a special hearing in the European parliament on Tuesday: “If a company decides by themselves which studies to disclose and which ones to withhold, it is obvious that the decisions by the [regulatory] authorities become unreliable.” He said risk management decisions had been delayed by 18 years in one case.Officials from the European Commission, the European Food Standards Agency (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), all of which have a role in pesticide regulation, thanked Mie and his colleague Prof Christina Rudén for their “important” and “valuable” work.“We considered [the withholding of the studies] a breach of the legal obligations of those companies and a matter of very serious concern,” said Claire Bury, the commission’s deputy director-general for health and food safety.“All studies are essential to have available to the regulator, irrespective of the outcome of them,” said Sharon McGuinness at ECHA. “It helps us make a robust assessment and ultimately protects citizens and the environment.”Bernhard Url, at EFSA, called the companies’ behaviour “unethical” and said: “Industry judges the relevance [of the toxicity studies] in a way that we would most likely not agree with.”MEPs were scathing about the companies. The Swedish MEP Emma Wiesner, a member of the European parliament’s committee on the environment, public health and food safety, said: “The behaviour found in this study is really unacceptable. More than a quarter of the studies [sent to US authorities] were not sent into the European agencies – that is outrageous.”The Lithuanian MEP Juozas Olekas said the companies had caused themselves “reputational damage”, while Martin Häusling, a German MEP and member of the agriculture committee, said: “This is a right old scandal. These [are] clear breaches of existing law and previous law. And yet there are no consequences.”The power to impose penalties on companies for breaching regulatory requirements lies with individual member states of the EU, and not with the commission, unlike in cases of breaches of competition law and data protection for example. However, no country is known to have ever imposed such a penalty.Ruden said: “We were not able to identify any legal risks that the company runs when withholding a toxicity study from EU authorities. Companies are allowed to make money at the expense of public health protection.”Dr Cristina Alija, from Bayer, told the hearing: “Bayer has always acted responsibly and transparently to provide the required data for a complete safety assessment of our substances. We have to submit all relevant data and this is what we did.”Dr Alexandra Brand, from Syngenta, said: “We did not submit [the toxicity studies] at the time to EU regulators because they were not mandatory. We determined they did not provide any new information. Our company complies with the rules. We have nothing to hide.”New rules came into force in 2021 requiring any new pesticide study by a company to be reported to the EU when it is commissioned. However, Mie said this did not solve the problem of studies withheld in the past for pesticides still in use.What difference the withheld studies would have made to regulations if disclosed at the start of the process is disputed. Mie said it was plausible in some cases that lower pesticide exposure limits could have been imposed years earlier. Bury said none would have been a “decisive factor” in regulatory decisions and the companies said they would have had no effect.Mie said his research could point to far wider withholding of toxicity studies on thousands of chemicals. “We have looked at a tiny fraction of all available pesticide toxicity studies, which in turn are only a small fraction of all toxicity studies. We have no reason to believe that the problem that we have identified is restricted to that tiny fraction,” he said."

This is nature striking back in a really harsh way.“It’s deeply shocking … the idea that these mountains of rubble still hold people, some of them still alive.“We haven’t really begun to count the number of dead.”He said that a 72-hour period after a disaster was usually the “golden period” for rescues, which had now expired, but that survivors were still being pulled out of the rubble.“It must be incredibly difficult to decide when to stop this rescue phase,” he said.Griffiths said he was launching a three-month operation for Turkey and Syria to help pay for the costs of operations there.Griffiths also told Reuters he hoped in Syria aid would go to both government and opposition-held areas, but that things with this regard were “not clear yet”.Earlier on Saturday, Stéphane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that negotiations were continuing to gain access to more areas in Syria and called for “solidarity” in the relief effort.‘My eyes were full of tears’: shooting the defining image of the Turkey earthquakeRead moreHe said: “Our message is clear, it’s time to put all politics aside. Just focus on the men, women and children who desperately need help in Syria and in southern Turkey.“Wherever we work, we have to work with the authorities in charge. That’s just the way that UN humanitarian aid is structured. So in the rebel-held territories, we work with the authorities there; in the government-held areas, we work with the government.”Responding to criticism of the UN’s response to the urgent need in Syria after the earthquake, he added:“I think if I was standing in the middle of devastation and my community had been hit, I would be unhappy and I would be critical because aid never comes quickly enough. But I can tell you that the UN stands with the people of Syria, whether they live in rebel territories, whether they live in government-held territories.”Reuters contributed to this report"

Preliminary estimates for the year to 31 March 2023 indicated emissions totalled 464Mt CO2-e, or 0.2% lower on a rolling 12-month tally, the national greenhouse gas inventory shows.Between June 2005 and the end of 2022, carbon pollution dropped 24.7%, or slightly more than half the Albanese government’s 43% emissions reduction target by 2030.Australia’s total budget under the Paris climate agreement is 4.353bn tonnes of CO2-e, and so far it has burned through 27% of the total in 25% of the accord’s time period.We need emissions to keep falling at the rate they did during the lockdowns, and well... they are not. pic.twitter.com/hL9ucUvdHS— Greg Jericho (@GrogsGamut) May 31, 2023Of the sectors, emissions from land use, land use changes and forestry decreased by the largest margin since June 2005, the government said. The reported drop of 179.1%, or 144.6Mt CO2-e, was “due to reductions in land clearing and native forest harvesting, increases in plantations and native vegetation, and improvements in soil carbon”.Some analysts, though, have questioned how the land sector can realistically be considered an ongoing carbon sink when land clearing in Queensland and NSW has increased in the past decade.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe reduction in emissions in the power sector is more clearcut, with a limited number of polluting sites closely monitored by regulators. Emissions from this industry have fallen 21.4% or 42.1Mt CO2-e since June 2005, although the sector continues to account for about a third of pollution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2022, though, heavy rainfall in New South Wales and Queensland curbed some coalmining output, resulting in a 1.7% drop, or 800,000 tonnes of CO2-e.Falling emissions from stationary energy, such as that used in manufacturing and gas heating in homes, all retreated in 2022, easing back 1.5% or 1.6Mt CO2-e.As Covid restrictions eased, transport emissions gained 4.9% or 4.4Mt CO2-e, last year, led by people taking more flights. Agriculture was another sector emitting more, with the total up 2.6% or 2Mt CO2-e, as livestock numbers and crop production bounced back to pre-drought levels, the government said."

        "text": "Heat deaths surged by 50% in Phoenix in 2023 – the deadliest year on record after extreme temperatures pummeled America’s hottest city, official figures show.At least 579 people lost their lives to heat this year, with senior citizens accounting for one in three deaths, according to the year’s final heat surveillance report by the medical examiner’s office in Maricopa county, where Phoenix is located. Another 56 suspected heat deaths are still under investigation.A very American death: how Caleb Blair lost his life in the Phoenix heatRead moreAt least 45% of people who died were unsheltered and sleeping behind dumpsters, in car parks or on the burning hot sidewalk – even as daily temperatures hit 115F (46C) or higher on 22 different days. Heat deaths are always preventable given the right resources, according to public health experts.The annual heat death toll has risen threefold since 2019, as the city’s affordable housing and addiction crises have converged with the climate emergency. Almost 1,900 people have died in the past five years, and thousands more have needed emergency medical help.Phoenix, the capital of Arizona and America’s fifth-largest city with 1.6 million people, is accustomed to a hot desert climate, but temperatures are rising due to global heating – made worse by decades of unchecked urban development that created a sprawling heat island.In 2021, the city created a dedicated extreme heat office to tackle the rising death toll and make the stifling urban landscape more livable by increasing tree cover and built shade – especially in low-income neighborhoods which are often the least green and the hottest.In early August, the Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, declared a statewide heat emergency after an unprecedented hot spell with 31 consecutive days at 100F or higher in Phoenix. The previous record was 18 consecutive days, recorded in 1974, according to the National Weather Service (NWS) in Phoenix.The goal of the emergency declaration is to develop a coordinated response to tackle heat inequities across the state, but experts say that this will take time.“Seniors, who are more vulnerable to extreme heat, are being displaced through increased housing costs at a rate faster than government agencies can find shelter for them. We are moving to more sustainable funding for emergency needs like cooling centers,” said Melissa Guardaro, assistant research professor at Arizona State University’s Global Institute of Sustainability and Innovation.“One heat office is not going to make a dent in a housing and substance abuse crisis over the course of a year. We are seeing the impact of an intersectional crisis where extreme heat is exposing fractures in our infrastructure,” Guardaro said.This summer was the hottest on record – in Phoenix and globally – and the prolonged searing heat would have been “virtually impossible” without human-made global heating, climate scientists found.In Phoenix, the climate signal was strongest at night, when the temperature failed to drop below 90F (32C) on 35 days – another record. The hotter nights are particularly alarming for public health experts because heat is cumulative, and the body cannot start to properly recover until the temperature drops below 80F.Unhoused in Phoenix’s perilous heat: ‘If I don’t keep cool, I’ll die’Read moreThere is no accurate nationwide heat death toll, and Maricopa county produces the country’s most detailed heat mortality and morbidity information – thanks in large part to the heat-focused autopsies and field investigations carried out by the medical examiner’s officer.According to the final weekly report, 30% of the heat victims in 2023 were women, compared with 19% last year. People of color accounted for 42% of heat deaths, with Black and Indigenous Americans the most disproportionately affected, census data suggests.One in four people died indoors, and while 90% had air conditioning, in most cases the units did not function. At least two people who died inside had no electricity – a virtual death sentence in such extreme heat.The city’s heat office did not respond to request for comment on this year’s high death toll, but in August the director, David Hondula, said: “We can get to zero deaths with the right resources … obviously no city anywhere in the world has yet demonstrated what the right mix of resources looks like for zero heat-related deaths, but [we’re] at the forefront of pursuing them.”"

Tourists have flocked to California’s Death Valley where temperatures reached a near-world record of 53.3C on Sunday.On the same day, China issued several temperature alerts, including its highest-ever temperature of 52.2C in the remote Xinjiang township of Sanbao.Extreme temperatures recorded across northern hemisphereRead moreIn Europe, a second heat storm, which follows the Cerberus heatwave that began on 10 July, could see temperatures approach the European record of 48.8C, while wildfires burn in Greece and Spain.The current extreme weather comes after previous heatwaves that swept Europe, northern Africa and south and south-east Asia in April and May.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n“I’m not surprised but I’m very concerned, because these events are just persisting for so long,” says Associate Prof Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales Canberra who focuses on heatwaves.“The Mediterranean area is warming twice as fast as the global average, so it’s no surprise that they’re seeing these supercharged heatwaves year on year.”What causes heatwaves?Regardless of location, all heatwaves are driven by high-pressure weather systems – also called anticyclones – which bring calm, stable air over a region, with little wind and few clouds.“Two effects happen: it allows radiation from the sun to come in which is absorbed by the Earth and re-emitted – and that’s what heats the atmosphere,” Perkins-Kirkpatrick says. “Also, you get lots of sinking air come down the centre, which also warms the local area.”00:03:10What is supercharging the global heat? – video explainerDr Andrew King, a senior lecturer in climate science at the University of Melbourne, says heatwaves are influenced by large-scale climate drivers like the El Niño Southern Oscillation (Enso) and also smaller weather systems and local factors such as dry soils or the urban heat island effect.In the northern hemisphere, the polar jet stream – a belt of westerly winds – can sometimes result in “blocking highs”: systems that allow heat to build in specific areas. A “split jet” pattern with blocking highs is currently affecting parts of Europe and Asia, King says.The climate crisis is intensifying heatwaves – making them more frequent and longer-lasting. “We can already see this in our observations and we know this will continue as we continue to warm the planet,” King says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In Australia, they increase the chances of a drier and hotter summer.“If we have an El Niño supercharged by climate change, then we could be in for a very bad summer,” Perkins-Kirkpatrick says.Another climate driver, the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD), is predicted to enter a positive phase in the coming months. “It’s quite common to have El Niño and positive IOD events occur together,” King says. “They do reinforce each other a little bit because they’re both associated with drier, warmer conditions for much of south-east Australia.”Australia has warmed by 1.4C over the past century, compared with a global average of 1.1C.“What we’re seeing in the northern hemisphere is so incredibly extreme,” King says. “It should be a good incentive to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.”"

According to research published earlier this year, the average person eats at least 50,000 particles of microplastic annually and breathes in a similar quantity.The great British tea test: which part of the country brings us the very best brew?Read moreThe researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial teabags from shops and cafés in Montreal, which were cut open, washed and then steeped in near-boiling water for five minutes before being analysed by electron microscopes and spectroscopy.They found that a single bag released more than 11.6bn microplastics, which was “several orders of magnitude higher than plastic loads previously reported in other foods”, according to the study, which was published in the journal of Environmental Science and Technology.Most teabags are made from natural fibres, though many brands that use natural fibres still contain plastic to seal the bags. Some brands have moved away from paper teabags towards plastic bags, and it was these plastic bags that the researchers examined.Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic, which the researchers defined as ranging from 100nm to 5mm in size, which are mostly created by the disintegration of plastic litter. Researchers have found microplastics in the air, soil, rivers and the deepest oceans around the world, as well as in tap and bottled water, seafood and beer. Microplastics were also found in human stool samples for the first time in October.The Canadian team tested the potential toxicity of the microparticles released from the teabags by exposing water fleas to the contaminated water, finding the particles had behavioural effects and developmental malformations on the fleas.There is no evidence so far that the ingestion of microplastics poses a risk to humans, according the World Health Organisation. But, the United Nations body said more research was needed to fully understand how plastic spreads into the environment and works its way through human bodies.Researchers speculated that the reason for the high number of particles being shed by the teabags could be due to the fact that the plastic packaging had been in contact with boiling water, as even “food-grade” plastics may degrade or leach toxic substances when heated above 40C."

        "text": "“I’m not really sure why I’m here, lying in a bin-bag on the side of a hill, but I’m strangely glad that I am,” writes Raynor Winn, part of the way through her latest walking odyssey with her husband, Moth. She won’t be the only one glad. With her previous books, The Salt Path and The Wild Silence, having sold more than a million copies, Winn’s fans are legion and they won’t be disappointed by Landlines. Its pages offer the same potent blend of big themes (the climate crisis, extinction, migration, food security, homelessness, terminal illness, friendship) illuminated by intimate details, small observations, and a sort of magic as simple and complex as love itself. I’ve never met Ray or Moth, but it’s hard not to feel I’d know them at a glance, even from a great distance, by the comfortable glow of their old and intricate partnership, fray-edged and worn to exquisite imperfection.The story of Landlines is another leap of faith, another long walk. Some things have changed: Ray and Moth no longer pass unrecognised, they are no longer homeless, they no longer have to survive on the most meagre of trail rations, but the shadow of Moth’s illness – a condition known as corticobasal degeneration – has not gone away. In fact, it has encroached further, as the doctors said it would, albeit more slowly than anyone expected. After a relapse and a grim consultation, they do what they have done before in the face of disaster, and hit the trail. Not just any trail, but the toughest and wildest Britain has to offer: the Cape Wrath. I’ll resist spoilers, but it doesn’t go according to plan.No matter: like the migrant cuckoos that inspire her, and the resident skylarks and golden eagles whose voices and struggles are woven through the narrative, Winn is someone in whom hope swells larger than doubt. There are other avian totems too. Perhaps the most poignant is the golden plover, which manifests for weeks as a mysterious call in the dark. If that one note, sung night after night, could be said to represent any of the themes in this wonderful book, it would be resilience. There are other recurring motifs too – the gift of friendship and the kindness of strangers, even during the strange phobia-inducing times of Covid-19.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Inside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Photograph: Mike UnwinWinn seems to have a bird’s-eye view of Britain – a map at her feet, a keen eye for detail, particularly for social injustice. Hers is a voice of empathy and integrity, and her points are never made polemically, but by the simple observation of others’ experiences. She highlights the effects of policy and socioeconomic trends as they ripple, sometimes rip, though people’s lives. When they meet dozens of youngsters roaming with plans to spend a night on the Scottish summit of Suilven, she notes that anyone doing the same in most of England would be breaking the law, in a society where there is “no encouragement to further our understanding of our natural heritage … rather the opposite”.It’s not only landscape and geography that make this a very British adventure. There is an obsession with tea and salty chips that will be familiar to most long-distance walkers, and an understandable preoccupation with the weather, particularly precipitation. Water permeates the pages – but it is punctuated by bursts of dazzling light that are a special property of both our beloved rainy isle and of Winn’s writing. The walk becomes, as life often is, a quest for these moments, “a hope, a need, a prayer for the dance of light to resume”. Landlines is published by Michael Joseph (£20).

The filters can take up to 15 years to break down into microplastic.The former environment minister, Sussan Ley, announced a “taskforce to address plastic in littered cigarette butts” in March 2021 as part of a new national plan to tackle plastic waste.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe “industry-led cross-sectoral stewardship taskforce”, which was welcomed by many environmental groups, would have examined potential solutions – including removing butts from cigarettes entirely.The current environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the former government had “no money set aside, no members selected, no staff allocated and no terms of reference”.“Sussan Ley announced a ‘war on cigarette butts’ with a new taskforce that never existed,” Plibersek said.‘Single-use plastics’ to be phased out in Australia from 2025 include plastic utensils and strawsRead moreLey’s office has been contacted for comment.Plibersek did not confirm whether the cigarette butt taskforce would now be established. Instead, she said she had asked her department to report back “with options to sort this issue out”.“I’ve been clear in my public statements that the Albanese Labor government stands prepared to regulate if industry is unable to achieve results by themselves,” Plibersek said.Jeff Angel, the director of the Boomerang Alliance of 53 nongovernmental organisations concerned about plastic pollution, said the federal government should regulate change “rather than just set up a talkfest taskforce”.‘‘The previous government duped the community because its plastic plan with its bans on certain items and cigarette taskforce never got past the press release. I think the community is fast running out of patience and I hope they take heed of this,” Angel said.When the national plastics plan was announced, Ley described the 1m tonnes of single-use plastic consumed by Australians each year as “unsustainable”.Shannon Mead, the founder of the advocacy group No More Butts, recently requested an update on the taskforce given the time lapsed since its announcement and the scale of the problem.“Cigarette butts are the most littered item in Australia, costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars to clean up each year,” Mead said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s that simple,” Whish-Wilson said.Kate Noble, a manager with WWF Australia, said the federal government should be leading on tobacco-related pollution as it did with plain packaging reforms.“Options for regulation at the global level are now being discussed as part of UN plastic pollution treaty negotiations and new laws are being introduced in Europe to make tobacco companies pay for waste management and clean-up,” Noble said.When the taskforce was announced in 2021, a spokesperson for British American Tobacco Australia – the country’s biggest manufacturer of tobacco products – said the company was “not aware of the details” but welcomed “any opportunity to work with the government to address butt litter”."

The devices have also been linked to explosions and fires.Many product stewardship schemes do not accept e-cigarettes or can only process the battery. Disposable vapes often have an encapsulated battery that cannot be removed.According to the New South Wales Environmental Protection Authority, many vaping stores do provide basic information on how to discard products but this is of limited use as regulations vary widely across the state.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nKiernan said there was an “urgent, overdue” need for standardised processes for the disposal of e-cigarette devices to reduce pollution.“We need to set clear standards on environmentally responsible e-cigarette waste disposal and hold the industry accountable for adhering to them,” Kiernan said.“They shouldn’t be disposed of in the general waste bin, or the recycling bin and absolutely not discarded in the environment where they can leach toxic metals, battery acid and nicotine and other chemicals into the soil.”Mead suggested the federal government play a bigger role in regulation and ensure all products can be safely disposed.“If affordability is a reason why so many people are taking up vaping, an increase in the sales price to cover the implementation of a refund scheme could also act as a deterrent,” Mead said.The federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, supports reform although any action would require cooperation from state, territory and local governments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The state government subsequently warned a similar explosion in an underground mine or near explosives could be catastrophic.The Victorian smoking and health survey, conducted by the Cancer Council, found the number of adults vaping had nearly doubled from 154,895 in 2018-19 to 308,827 in 2022.On 1 January Plibersek encouraged Australians to give up vaping as a new year resolution, claiming tobacco companies were intentionally marketing vape flavours and packaging that would appeal to a younger market.“Obviously it’s bad for your health but it’s also terrible for the environment,” Plibersek said."

In the poem The Broken he notes: “The facts are horrific / The evidence overwhelming / And still we carry on / As if no crisis were looming.”Taking in science, politics and future fantasy, the book is a literary howl of frustration at human inaction in the face of existential threat. In A Vision I Once Saw, a re-imagining of the story of Noah’s Ark, a man takes a potion that causes reality to bend before his eyes and during which he hallucinates “the last boat in the world” housing the few surviving animal species and “the last children left in a world that had gone wrong”. In And Peace Shall Return, a future civilisation stumbles upon tattered evidence of a “vanished species” who “altered nothing in their lives to try to avert the disaster that they saw coming and which was evident every day … They accepted, for centuries, that they were fundamentally unable to change.”The London-based actor Ashley Zhangazha is the narrator, capturing the anxiousness of Okri’s visions of a post-apocalyptic world where surviving humans must learn the lessons of the past while shaping their own future, and conveying the urgency of the author’s entreaties to act now to ensure these visions don’t become reality.

        "text": "A European parliament plenary vote, held in mid-July, might normally pass under the radar of all but the most passionate aficionados of Brussels politics. That will not be the case next week, when environmental campaigners will watch through their fingers as one of the most consequential decisions so far is made in relation to the EU’s net zero targets.Before heading for their summer holidays, MEPs are expected to vote on a proposed nature restoration law, committing European governments to rehabilitate and rewild swathes of territory suffering from desertification, deforestation and the draining of peatlands. Along with action on pesticides, this is essentially the biodiversity strand to the EU’s green deal. The law’s role in facilitating carbon capture and creating healthy, resilient ecosystems is deemed indispensable by scientists, if emissions reduction targets are to be met. But as with other aspects of the green transition, Europe’s increasingly dominant right is now mounting a sustained campaign to derail it.In the context of post-Ukraine economic pressures and priorities, the European People’s party (EPP) – which groups together centre-right parties – is arguing for a pause in environmental legislation. To that end, the EPP has allied with the climate-sceptic far right in Brussels, and is set to oppose the restoration law. As a result, next week’s vote is on a knife edge. But the broader picture is still more disturbing.Amid concerns over the cost of living crisis, and a growing challenge from populist anti-green parties across Europe, mainstream conservatives are increasingly viewing opposition to the timetable and cost of the net zero transition as smart politics. In Germany, the extreme nationalists of Alternative für Deutschland are vying for second place in the polls, after leading attacks on government plans for the conversion of home heating systems to renewable energy. The centre-right Christian Democratic Union, which before the last election was contemplating coalition with the German Greens, is duly tacking in the same direction.In Spain – where a snap election this month may see the far right enter government for the first time since the return of democracy – the high-profile conservative mayor of the Madrid region has accused the left of overstating the gravity of the climate crisis. Elsewhere, the rise of the Farmer-Citizen Movement in the Netherlands, which opposes attempts to reduce nitrogen emissions from intensive farming, has come to symbolise a potential rural backlash against net zero targets. Centre-right parties, for which agricultural regions are traditional strongholds, are rushing to represent the cause.The world cannot afford for Europe to cool on its climate commitments. But as conservatives seek to turn the green deal into a dividing line, progressive leaders must respond to the threat where they have the power to do so. Much more needs to be done to persuade the less well-off and rural communities that they will be looked after in a time of upheaval. A renewed focus is needed on meaningful subsidies – for example, for homeowners switching to renewable forms of energy – and viable future pathways for those working in affected industries. Brussels’ plan for a €87bn “social climate fund”, due to be phased in from 2026, is nowhere near enough, given the scale and urgency of the task.A new age of economic and geopolitical insecurity has made a challenging transition even tougher. In the face of political headwinds, it will not be accomplished on the cheap."

Thunderstorms require warm, humid air to form, and strike more commonly in the summer months when solar energy is abundant.There are three key components required to produce a thunderstorm, according to the BoM:\nHigh moisture in the atmosphere, which can sometimes be identified by the presence of low clouds or haziness in the morning.\nAn unstable atmosphere, with high temperatures near the ground that fall sharply with increasing height.\nA trigger that lifts air up vertically in the atmosphere, through differences in air density. This can arise from local variations in heating, or the approach of a front or low pressure trough.\nskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Conditions in the northern half of Australia between October through March were favourable for thunderstorms, it said. “Lower pressure lies across northern and central Australia, and gives rise to the vertical motion and low level convergence that favour thunderstorm development.”But it also said “severe winter storms linked to cold fronts are common in the south-west of Western Australia and south-east South Australia.”What effect does climate change have on thunderstorms?According to the CSIRO’s 2022 state of the environment report, daily rainfall totals associated with storms have increased in Australia since 1979, especially in northern parts of the country. “This is primarily due to an increase in the intensity of rainfall per storm,” it found. In future decades, Australia is projected to experience fewer tropical cyclones, but an increased proportion of high-intensity storms with higher rainfall.Rainfall events are predicted to intensify with global heating, as the atmosphere is able to hold about 7% more water vapour for each degree of warming.Rapid storm-related extreme rainfall events may intensify at an even higher rate, according to the Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub, because “the additional moisture in the atmosphere may also cause more intense convection for thunderstorms”. Short duration rainfall intensity could increase by about 15% for each degree of warming, it has warned.Historical analysis by the BoM found no consistent link between peaks and troughs in thunderstorm frequency and El Niño or La Niña events. However, it found “some evidence that thunderstorms tended to be less frequent over south-eastern Australia” – Sydney, Adelaide and Canberra particularly – during strong El Niño years."

        "text": "Holyrood and Westminster are heading for another showdown as the UK government prepares to block a second policy move by the Scottish government this year.Alister Jack, the Scotland secretary, intends to deny a request from the SNP government for a trade exemption for its flagship recycling scheme, in a move that experts say could fatally undermine the plans.Under the scheme, which is due to start in August, Scottish retailers will have to add 20p to the price of single-use bottles and cans, which consumers can then reclaim by returning them to be recycled.It is a key part of the Scottish National party’s environmental platform, but most experts believe that to work properly it needs an exemption from UK-wide rules that prevent different regulations applying to the same product in England and Scotland.Jack has criticised the scheme as badly designed and inflationary, telling the Commons recently that it would be bad for businesses and consumers. Talking specifically about the likelihood of granting an exemption, he said: “The exemption bar is very high indeed, otherwise what is the point of the UK internal market?”Environmental campaigners say the scheme is vital for reducing litter as well as CO2 emissions. But business leaders say it will add huge costs to their products, not only through the extra price of a bottle, but also with the associated production and administration costs.Jack told the Commons recently that under the scheme the price of a 12-pack of Scottish water sold at Aldi would rise from £1.59 to £3.99.If he persuades the cabinet to agree to refuse Holyrood’s request, it is likely to provoke another constitutional row with the Scottish government just two months after Westminster blocked the Scottish gender recognition bill. That decision triggered acrimony between the two governments, arguably contributing to the decision by Nicola Sturgeon to resign as first minister weeks later.A spokesperson for the Scottish government said: “We expect a decision from the UK government as soon as possible given that this is what is needed to give industry absolute clarity.”One Holyrood official said the bottle deposit scheme was “wholly within devolved competence and approved by the Scottish parliament in 2020 with cross-party support”.Scottish ministers have been planning the DRS for years, with Lorna Slater, the green minister, calling it a “massive national undertaking”, involving 4,000 producers, 10,000 “takeback” machines, and 2bn drinks containers.The rest of the UK is planning its own bottle deposit scheme, but that will not start for another two years – and England will exempt glass bottles. In the intervening two years, separate barcodes will be needed for Scottish drinks to prove where they were bought.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Humza Yousaf has suggested he would exclude small businesses in the scheme’s first year of operation. His main rival, Kate Forbes, has said the scheme would cause carnage for businesses. Ash Regan has said she would scrap the scheme in its current form.Nevertheless, the Scottish government is pressing ahead with the plans, and this month it asked for an exemption from the UK Internal Market Act, which was passed in 2020 to replace the European single market and make sure goods continue to move freely around the UK.The importance of the exemption is disputed. Supporters of the bill recently commissioned a legal opinion from Stuart MacLennan, a professor of law at Coventry, which said the scheme could operate without one.UK ministers believe the exemption is needed for the scheme to apply to the 85% of drinks sold in Scotland that are made elsewhere. Some experts believe that without the exemption the entire scheme would be illegal.Kat Jones, the director of the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland, said: “We know that there has been a lot of work behind the scenes between UK government and the Scottish government officials to establish how the Scottish systems can operate most effectively in a UK context, and so this intervention from the secretary of state feels like an attempt to disrupt deposit return.”"

        "text": "The state-owned New South Wales forestry agency has been ordered to immediately stop logging in parts of a state forest after the Environment Protection Authority found a dead greater glider – an endangered species – nearby.Conservation groups had written to the state government and EPA to investigate Forestry Corporation logging in the Tallaganda state forest, east of Canberra, as it was one of the last known strongholds of the southern greater glider.The EPA said it inspected several active logging areas in the forest on Tuesday after receiving a complaint and found a dead glider about 50m from where Forestry Corporation was working.NSW Labor accused of ‘fundamental breach of trust’ over logging in promised koala national parkRead moreIt ordered all logging, haulage and road and track construction work in the area to stop for at least 40 days while the death was investigated.The EPA’s acting executive director operations, Steve Orr, said the cause of the glider’s death was not known, but it was “extremely concerning”. The species has been increasingly reliant on unburnt forest areas after its habitat was severely damaged in the black summer bushfires nearly four years ago, he said.The greater glider is Australia’s largest gliding marsupial, with bodies up to 45cm long and furry, prehensile tails that extend another 60cm. It was listed as endangered in 2022 after losing significant parts of its habitat to bushfire, drought, land-clearing and logging. Scientists estimate its population has fallen by about 80% in 20 years in some areas.Logging machinery in in Tallaganda state forest. Photograph: Wilderness AustraliaOrr said the Forestry Corporation was required to protect and implement 50m logging exclusion zones around large “den trees” that gliders relied on for food and shelter.“While community reports suggest around 400 southern greater gliders may be living in the Tallaganda State Forest, [Forestry Corporation] has identified only one den tree,” he said. “We are not confident that habitat surveys have been adequately conducted to ensure all den trees are identified.“The EPA has a strong compliance and enforcement program for native forestry, and we will take immediate action where warranted, including issuing stop work orders for alleged non-compliance.”Environment groups praised the EPA and state environment minister Penny Sharpe for acting swiftly, and called for it to make the native forest logging ban permanent.Rachel Lowry, the chief conservation officer with World Wide Fund for Nature Australia, said it showed that promised environmental law reform needed to be accelerated “if Australia wants to live by our nation’s commitment to zero extinctions”.“We applaud all our supporters and the many community groups who have mobilised to expose this destruction,” Lowry said. “The fact that it had to come to this, an actual sighting of a deceased, endangered animal, is beyond sad.”Bob Debus, the chair of the group Wilderness Australia and a former Labor state environment minister, said the group had “long been concerned at the apparent efforts of the Forestry Corporation to undermine environmental policy in NSW”.“As a publicly owned body, the Forestry Corporation should be attempting to miminise environmental damage during logging operations. Instead, they appear to be deliberately targeting the areas of highest conservation value within the state forest estate for destruction,” Debus said.Forestry Corporation said protecting greater glider habitat was crucial, and it had “spent many months preparing for these operations through intensive pre-harvest surveys to identify and map sensitive habitat and ecological features”.“We are fully committed to investigating what has occurred and finding out what the circumstances are around the greater glider found dead in the forest,” a spokesperson said.The state Greens MP Sue Higginson said she had also raised concerns about the logging with the EPA. “These forests are worth so much more to NSW when they’re standing,” she said."

The worker, who has been farming foxes for more than 30 years, says they have stopped after operating at a loss for several years in a row.China is the world’s biggest producer of animal fur, but here in Suning county, its “capital of fur”, business appears quiet. “The whole industry chain – raw fur and garment production – is struggling,” says the farm worker.An average of more than 4,000 fur enterprises deregistered their business licences each year between 2017 and 2019, according to Economic Daily, with an estimated 52% having quit the industry as of January 2022.Data published by the China Leather Industry Association indicates that the total output of fur extracted from minks, foxes and raccoon dogs in China fell from 87m pelts in 2014, to 39m in 2019 and 27m in 2021.Animal welfare campaigners say the industry has been hit by growing awareness of animal cruelty and by the use of other materials, such as hemp and frayed denim, in place of fur.At the Huasi International Fur City, home to more than 1,000 brands, retailers are also pessimistic. “We’ve been running this shop for five years, and business has gone downhill over the past few years, especially since the pandemic,” Mrs Zhang, a fur garment seller, tells the Guardian.A customer tries on a mink coat at a shopping mall in Shangcun, in China’s Hebei province. Photograph: Carlos García Rawlins/Reuters“More and more people are starting to boycott fur products, but I don’t think they see it from our perspective because they themselves aren’t involved in the industry. Some may call it greed, but we also keep pets and eat livestock, that’s because there is a demand, so how is it any different to fur trade?”However, China’s fur production could yet increase after countries including Denmark culled millions of animals bred for their fur, and temporarily banned production because of fears that a Covid mutation could be a hazard to human health.“As its global competitors such as Denmark and the Netherlands are losing their business and profits, there is a chance that China would seize this opportunity to gain a bigger share in the global market,” wrote the authors of a 2022 report published by non-profit group Act Asia.With China’s Covid-zero era coming to an end, fur cities are already hoping revitalise the business. A press release from the Suning local government states: “China has the largest consumer market around the globe, and the end of Covid restrictions is creating sound conditions for a prosperous fur industry.” Suning hopes to become “the world’s capital of fur”.Raccoon dogs and foxes are intensively farmed across Asia for their furAnimal welfare campaigners are outraged at the prospect and have called on countries including the UK to stop importing animal fur. The UK introduced a ban on fur farming in 2003, but does not ban imports. Fur worth just under £30m has been imported from China in the past five years, according to Humane Society International/UK.Recent footage from HSI’s campaign against fur farming in northern China has shown raccoon dogs, foxes and minks living in filthy cages barely larger than their body sizes, while past investigations have also shown foxes being electrocuted, beaten and even skinned alive.Danish farmers turn their backs on mink after Covid mutation cullRead more“If fur is too cruel to be produced here, it should be too cruel to sell here, and until such a ban is introduced, the UK remains complicit in the very same fur cruelty we set out to ban two decades ago,” said Claire Bass, HSI/UK’s director of public affairs.Peter Li, HSI’s China policy specialist, added: “China’s fur production can’t exist in isolation of the global market, and that global market is turning away from fur. China’s ban on the wildlife trade for consumption is a good start but in order to fully address potential future outbreaks, it is imperative that all countries permanently ban wildlife used for any purpose, and that includes fur production.”You can send us your stories and thoughts at animalsfarmed@theguardian.com"

        "text": "The formation of a supercontinent on Earth could wipe out humans and any other mammals that are still around in 250m years, according to a study.The mass extinction would be caused primarily by heat stress as a result of greater volcanic activity that would put twice as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as current levels, an older sun that would emit more radiation and the extent of inland deserts in the tropics.The supercontinent Pangea Ultima is expected to take shape when all the current continents merge together in the distant future. The paper, which was published on Monday in Nature Geoscience, is the first attempt to model how extreme the climate might become from that geological rearrangement.Using a UK Met Office climate model and the University of Bristol supercomputer, the simulation also provided tectonic clues to past extinction events and data that could be of use to astronomers looking for other habitable planets.In the era of Pangea Ultima, the temperature extremes are expected to be dramatic, with more humidity than now along the coasts and extremely arid conditions in the vast inland deserts. In this world, global temperatures could rise 15C (and up to 30C on land) above pre-industrial levels, which would return the world to the extreme heat it last went through in the Permian–Triassic era, 260m years ago, when more than 90% of species were eradicated. Protracted periods of heat in excess of 40C would be beyond the tolerance levels of many life forms.Mammals have been the world’s great evolutionary success story, particularly since the demise of the dinosaurs during the last great extinction event, but mammals’ ability to adapt to heat may be too slow. That includes humans, which have been on Earth for a relatively short period.Hominids emerged about 6m years ago when the world was a much cooler place than it had been during the dinosaur period. Although our species has developed remarkably quickly, we would face enormous challenges in the era of Pangea Ultima, assuming we make it through the current self-caused climate crisis and mass extinction of other species.In addition to the direct impacts of heat, there would be severe food supply problems due to a collapse of vegetation. The paper notes that most plants become stressed at temperatures over 40C and break down completely if exposed to 60C for protracted periods.The paper’s lead author, Alexander Farnsworth, from the University of Bristol, said the prospect of another extinction event, which includes humans, was a sobering reminder of transience. “The Earth has a very changeable environment. Humans are very lucky with what we have now and we should not be pushing our own climate beyond the cooler climate that we evolved through. We are the dominant species but Earth and its climate decide how long that lasts,” he said. “What comes after is anyone’s guess. The dominant species could be something completely new.”The authors acknowledge their prediction has a high level of uncertainty due to the ultra-long-term timeframe, but they hope the study, which was initiated during the pandemic lockdown, will provide useful insights into past mass extinction events and the possible habitability of other planets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The new study indicates that tectonics are also an important factor in determining the climate of a planet.“If Nasa could only send a space shuttle to a single planet, then I would choose one that didn’t have a super continent,” Farnsworth said. “Better to have multiple continents scattered around, as is the case now on Earth.” This article was amended on 27 September 2023.

        "text": "Whales have taken as long as two hours to die during Icelandic hunts, according to a report by the Icelandic food and veterinary authority.A number of the carcasses of the fin whales shot by explosive harpoons during hunts in Iceland last year were examined by the organisation, which found that almost 40% struggled for approximately 11 and a half minutes before they died, while two took more than an hour. A quarter of the fin whales, the second-largest mammal on Earth after the blue whale, considered “vulnerable” globally by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, had to be harpooned a second time. Only 59% died instantly.The report, described as alarming by Iceland’s minister of food agriculture and fisheries, found the killing of some whales had taken too long. The provisions of the animal welfare act on hunting had not been violated, it found, due to the “best known” methods used by the hunt. But it questioned whether hunting large whales could meet animal welfare objectives and referred its finding to an expert animal welfare council to decide.Animal welfare campaigners described the findings as intolerable and unacceptable and called on the Icelandic government to halt all whale hunts.Svandís Svavarsdóttir, Iceland’s minister of food, agriculture and fisheries, said: “This alarming report underscores the need for a discussion in Iceland about the values we want to be known for. I believe that industries incapable of guaranteeing animal welfare should be considered part of our past rather than our future. This report, along with the expert council on animal welfare’s findings, will serve as essential background material for making decisions about the future of whaling post 2023.”Iceland is one of the few countries that hunts whales commercially, along with Norway and Japan, despite a ban on commercial whaling that has been in place since 1986 under the international whaling commission.However, Svavarsdóttir said last year that the country planned to end whaling from 2024 as demand dwindled. Last August, the ministry issued a regulation requiring the food and veterinary authority (MAST) to carry out regular inspections of whaling hunts, in order to promote animal welfare.Patrick Ramage, senior director at the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), said: “Whatever their views on whaling, both Icelanders and the international community will be horrified by these findings. No animal – however it is killed – should suffer for such a long time. Whales are sentient, intelligent and complex creatures that suffer both physically and psychologically during this traumatic massacre.”“There is no humane way to kill a whale at sea. This new evidence underscores how outdated this practice is. It has to end immediately – no one in Iceland is dependent on this meat.”In Iceland, 148 whales were killed in 2022. The hunting of 58 whales was filmed and analysed by experts on behalf of the food and veterinary authority. It showed, of the 36 whales shot more than once, five whales were shot three times and four whales were shot four times. One whale with a harpoon in its back was chased for five hours without success.Árni Finnsson, the chair of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association, said: “This killing is inhumane; it has to stop. There is no economic benefit for Iceland and it undermines the country’s record as a pro-conservation nation.”Danny Groves, a spokesperson for Whale and Dolphin Conservation, said: “We’ve known for a long time that time to death in these hunts can take 20-25 minutes. It will be an agonising death because these are sentient beings. They will experience great pain.“You’re using a grenade-tipped harpoon from a moving ship to a moving target. This wouldn’t be allowed in a slaughterhouse in the UK.”"

The country’s public prosecutor said it is investigating a possible case of “ecocide”.Ukraine and Russia have each accused the other of deliberately blasting the main concrete barrier. Other media point to satellite data that shows a road across the dam was already partly inundated in recent days and that water levels were at a record high.The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, blamed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine for the collapse and described the explosion as an “environmental catastrophe”.Analysts told the Guardian that the scale of the damage would depend on the amount of water released and the extent of the damage to the barrier, both of which are still unknown. At the very least, it has forced the evacuation of thousands of people, flooded national parks and jeopardised water supplies to millions of people.

Photograph: Ed Ram/The GuardianThe International Energy Agency tweeted that its experts at Zaporizhzhia, which is 100 miles (160km) upstream, are closely monitoring the situation. They said there was “no immediate nuclear safety risk at plant”, because the cooling pools are already full.This could change in the future, if the reservoir behind the dam is significantly depleted, which would make it difficult to replenish the cooling system and operate the diesel generators.Former minister of ecology Ostap Semerak told the Guardian that in his opinion this was the greatest threat currently posed by the breach, but other dangers could emerge in the days and weeks ahead as flood waters engulf cities, petrol stations and farms, become contaminated by agrochemicals and oil products and then flow into the Black Sea.“This will have an impact on Romania, Georgia, Turkey and Bulgaria. It will be harmful for all the region” he said. “Our government has announced this is the biggest environmental catastrophe in Europe over the past 10 years, and I think it may be the worst in Ukraine since Chornobyl in 1986.”The turbine room at the hydropower plant is already under water and 150 tonnes of industrial lubricants have been washed away, according to Zelenskiy.Olena Kravchenko, the director of the Ukrainian Environment People Law NGO, said Russia’s “ecocide” risked “unprecedented environmental consequences” to the areas downstream of the Dnipro River, the Dnipro estuary, and ecosystems in the coastal area of the Black Sea.With images of entire houses being washed away, she says the river will be polluted by debris and hazardous chemicals. Water supplies could be reduced or cut in several cities, including Kherson, and irrigation may prove impossible in swathes of agricultural land, affecting crops.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "A first-of-its-kind municipal climate charter in Texas could throw a wrench in US fossil fuel extraction. Residents of a major Texas city just west of the Permian Basin, the largest oil field in the US, will have the chance to vote on the package this spring.If the proposal passes, the city of El Paso would adopt a comprehensive climate policy that would include prohibiting the use of city water for extraction projects outside city limits, such as in the Permian Basin, which makes up roughly 40% of all US oil production.“El Paso is on the verge of potentially passing one of the most progressive pieces of climate legislation in the country,” said Deirdre Shelly, campaigns director for the national Sunrise Movement.Oil wells guzzle precious California water. Next door, residents can’t use the tapRead moreProponents say the climate charter would prepare El Paso to withstand extreme weather events and accelerate the city’s transition to renewables, requiring 80% of its energy to come from carbon free sources by 2030. It also encourages rooftop solar development, proposes establishing a climate department and could move the ownership of El Paso Electric into the city’s hands. The utility company was purchased in 2020 by a JP Morgan-tied fund.“We’re battling the fossil fuel giants in our community,” said Ana Fuentes, a 25-year-old resident of El Paso and a campaign manager for the local Sunrise chapter. “This charter would allow people to have the platform and a space where our concerns will be prioritized over the bottom line of fossil fuel oligarchs.”Last July, Sunrise El Paso and Austin-based Ground Game Texas submitted nearly 40,000 petition signatures to get the climate charter on the ballot for the November 2022 election, but due to a prolonged verification process, the vote on the plan will take place in the 6 May election. Roughly half of the petition signers were people under the age of 35.“Something [we] talk a lot about a lot is climate anxiety, and I think we all feel it and it shows in those numbers,” Fuentes said.The climate charter has the potential to disrupt drilling in the Permian Basin. The proposed policy would ban the use of city water for fossil fuel activities outside of El Paso limits. The annual amount of freshwater used for fracking the Texas side of the Permian Basin was estimated at 72bn gallons in 2019. That is a 2,400% rise from 2010, according to the US Geological Survey.“We would be able to preserve the water within our desert community for household use, instead of having that water be sent to fracking and fossil fuel projects outside the city,” said Fuentes.Fracking uses large amounts of water that is scarce in desert communities like El Paso. On top of that, this process of extracting natural gas has been shown to cause groundwater contamination.Water used for fracking is “laced with chemicals [and then] percolates through to people’s agricultural fields and sometimes wells where people drink them”, said Mark Jacobson, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University. The fossil fuel activities in the Permian Basin, which have been termed a “carbon bomb” by environmentalists, release planet-heating methane and volatile organic compounds associated with poor air quality that can degrade human health.Red states leading the US in solar and wind production, new report showsRead moreThe El Paso chamber of commerce, a membership group representing the interest of businesses, wrote in an emailed statement that it opposes the climate charter, stating that the proposition “has the right endgame in mind – an improved climate, but doing so will cost us the very livelihoods it seeks to enrich”. The chamber claims that the climate charter would pose a “clear detrimental effect to local businesses and regional economy”, according to the findings from the economic impact report that the chamber paid for.Sharon Wilson, an organizer with the non-profit Earthworks who previously worked in the oil and gas industry, said this type of fear mongering from industry stakeholders is par for the course when environmentalists propose bold climate action.“The oil and gas industry actually uses some of the same tactics that the tobacco industry used to deceive the public about the harm of tobacco,” said Wilson. Indeed, there is a documented history of companies like Exxon and Chevron borrowing from the tobacco industry’s playbook.“At some point the tobacco industry was not allowed to advertise any more and that needs to happen with the oil and gas industry.” Wilson said. “Smoking is a choice, breathing air is not.” The headline of this article was amended on 10 March 2023. As the main text makes clear, the Permian Basin is the largest oil field in the US, not in the world as an earlier headline said."

        "text": "Some of Australia’s most famous beaches, including the tourist hotspot Noosa, are increasingly vulnerable to coastal erosion caused by successive years of La Niña, with experts voicing fears for local biodiversity.Beaches along Australia’s south-east coast erode substantially during prolonged La Niña events, a study analysing four decades of satellite imagery has suggested.The research comes amid warnings that erosion along Queensland’s Sunshine Coast, after three consecutive La Niña years, is significantly affecting local biodiversity.Dr Javier Leon, a senior lecturer in physical geography at the University of the Sunshine Coast, has been monitoring the shoreline between Noosa’s Main Beach and Coolum. Global heating to drive stronger La Niña and El Niño events by 2030, researchers sayRead moreHe estimated that over the last three years on average the shoreline has retreated by about 20 metres, while the sand dunes have receded between 7m and 10m and vertically eroded by 2m to 3m.Usually, some turtle nesting occurs along that stretch of coast between November and January – “30 or so every year”, Leon estimates. “This year there have been no nests.”“I’m assuming that it is because the beach and dunes have been eroded so there’s no place where turtles can [make] their nests,” he said, noting that there had been nesting activity further south, where beaches were less eroded.“If you were to leave a coastal system by itself, the beach would move a lot. The real problem is when you have infrastructure behind, or even worse, on those dunes.” Leon cited Main Beach and Maroochydore as particularly vulnerable areas.The Queensland analysis is in keeping with the findings of satellite research that studied more than 8,300km of coastline along the Pacific basin, looking at the effects of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation on wave-dominated sandy beaches.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nEnso oscillates between warm El Niño, cold La Niña and neutral phases as a result of differences in sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean.Of the Australian coastline analysed, the researchers found that between 1984 and 2022, 48% of beaches experienced significant erosion during La Niña years.“That signal is very clear in south-east Australia,” said the study’s first author, Dr Kilian Vos of the University of New South Wales. The erosion during La Niña was linked to a 7% increase in wave power and sea level changes, Vos said.Conversely, El Niño was associated with an accumulation of sand across 75% of beaches analysed. Enso appeared to have the opposite effect on the other side of the Pacific, resulting in the accretion of sand on to beaches during La Niña years along the west coast of the Americas.“Enso is very asymmetric,” Vos said. “El Niño events are very intense and very short, while La Niña events are rarely as strong but they last much longer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If there have been many storms in the past year, the beach will be eroded and will take a long time to recover.”He pointed to 2012-13 as an example, when the most extensive erosion in Australia was recorded. That year the Enso was in the neutral phase, but it followed two consecutive years of strong La Niña conditions.“This highlights how El Niño and La Niña can trigger prolonged erosion phases on sandy coastlines,” the study’s authors wrote.Half the wetlands in Europe lost in past 300 years, researchers calculateRead moreThe researchers studied only wave power but not the direction from which the waves arrived along the coast.Leon, who was not involved in the study, said along Australia’s east coast waves tended to hit the beaches from a south-east direction, but “La Niña usually means more waves from the east”.“As soon as you get too many easterly waves, then a lot of those beaches are not used to it, so they are prone to erosion,” he said. “That’s what we’ve observed in the last three years.”Anthropogenic climate change would further complicate the natural cycle of coastline changes, Leon added. “The projections are that for the east coast of Australia, regardless of La Niña or El Niño, we will see waves shifting anti-clockwise, meaning they will come more and more from the east – because of climate change.”The research was published in the journal Nature Geoscience."

        "text": "The unmistakable influence of the climate crisis helped cause New York City to be inundated by a month’s worth of rain within just a few hours on Friday, scientists have warned, amid concerns over how well the city is prepared for severe climate shocks.A new rapid attribution study, released by scientists in Europe, has found that the type of storm seen on Friday is now 10-20% wetter than it would have been in the previous century, because of climate change.Flash flooding soaked large parts of the US’s largest city, turning roads into rivers, following intense rainfall that broke records. John F Kennedy international airport measured 8in of rainfall in one day, the most since records began, while Brooklyn received a month’s worth of rain in just a few hours. People had to be rescued from swamped basement apartments, subway and bus services were canceled and sewage backed up in overwhelmed pipes.Climate scientists have stressed that such pounding rainfall is a symptom of a warming planet, with a hotter atmosphere able to hold more moisture that is then unleashed in torrential downpours.“Human-driven climate change plays a dual role, both intensifying these storms and warming the atmosphere,” said Davide Faranda, a scientist at the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace in France. “Deeper storms yield more intense phenomena, while a warmer atmosphere can accommodate a greater amount of rain.”Tommaso Alberti, a researcher at Italy’s Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, said that the extreme event that hit New York “aligns with climate change projections”. He added that while natural variability can deliver major storms, “human-driven climate change is the primary driver, underscoring the urgent need for climate mitigation and adaptation efforts”.Global heating has fueled contrasting extremes in rainfall across the US. While much of the arid south-west has faced prolonged drought – punctuated by occasional disastrous flooding events – the US north-east, including New York, has seen a significant increase in heavy rainfall. The amount of precipitation falling in heavy events in the region has increased 55% since the 1950s, a federal government analysis has found, with climate change the main cause of this.Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania and author of a new book on the climate crisis, said that rapid attribution studies can miss some of the mechanisms that cause extreme weather, but that the increased threat of flooding was nevertheless undeniable.“New York is experiencing a very clear increase in these extreme – more than 2in per hour – rainfall events, and that’s clearly tied to a warming atmosphere,” he said.Such flooding can be deadly. In 2021, New York was hit by Hurricane Ida, which caused 11 people to die from flooding that seeped into the basement apartments where many New Yorkers live.Following scenes where parts of New York again resembled a giant, fetid swimming pool, and less than four months after the city’s skies turned a toxic orange from wildfire smoke, questions have been raised about the preparedness of the metropolis, along with many other major cities, to escalating climate impacts.“The sad reality is our climate is changing faster than our infrastructure can respond,” Rohit Aggarwala, commissioner of the New York City department of environmental protection, admitted on Friday. Pipes and drains could not cope with the flood water, while the leadership of the city and state – including the city’s mayor, Eric Adams, and the governor, Kathy Hochul – has come under criticism for responding too slowly to the looming threat posed by the rainfall.“It’s clear that our cities and our aging infrastructure were built for a climate that no longer exists, particularly as a warmed atmosphere holds and releases more water,” said Daniel Zarrilli, the former chief climate policy adviser to New York City.“This requires not only greater investment to deal with the new extremes, but also the creativity to think differently about design for when the capacity of our infrastructure is inevitably exceeded.”"

Once bottled, they make a great gift, and are perfect for a secret Santa or dinner party present.In fact, all sorts of store-cupboard ingredients infuse well with spirits, too. I’ve had a jar of stem ginger in sweet syrup sitting at the back of the cupboard for a couple of years now, well out of date and without any discernible use, so I mixed it with vodka and a spent vanilla pod, and was surprised by how delicious the result was, both neat and super-cold from the freezer and mixed with soda, ice and a wedge of lime. I’ve also recently made marshmallow vodka to use up a packet of deflated and slightly crusty marshmallows.Sweet-infused vodkaI really don’t like sweet cocktails, so I was pleasantly surprised to find this infused vodka really quite palatable, either cold from the freezer or mixed with soda and a wedge of lime. But maybe I shouldn’t have been so surprised, because most cocktails need a little sugar to balance out the flavours.Excess sweets aren’t a commonplace waste product, admittedly, but it’s easy to build up a surfeit at Christmas, especially if you have a house full of children. Any sweet, candy or chocolate will work; in fact, defunct sweets such as whitened chocolate, moist rhubarb and custard, bonbons and gnarly old marshmallows are the perfect ingredient for an infused vodka.Here are a few guidelines to ensure you get the best results. There’s no need to use a high-quality alcohol, because the crude additives in most sweets will taint any subtleties of flavour. Stick to one type of sweet per batch, so you don’t muddle the flavours. Some sweets will dissolve entirely into the spirit, but others won’t, so strain them out and serve as delicious little alcoholic sweets – I’m planning on coating the stem ginger I used to infuse my vodka in chocolate, and turn it into boozy truffles.50-200g sweets – for example stem ginger, toffee, marshmallowsOptional spices – vanilla, star anise, cloves, etc – all to taste75cl vodka, or another spirit (tequila, brandy or grappa, say)Tip the sweets into a large glass bottle or jar (or a range of small reclaimed bottles and jars). Add any spice you think will work as a flavour combination, if you like, Then pour in the vodka to cover. Seal with a lid and leave to infuse for at least 24 hours. Check the flavour every day until you are happy with it, then store in the freezer, where it will keep for up to a year. Serve neat and super-cold or mix into a cocktail."

        "text": "A former North Sea oil and gas boss has been lined up to chair Great Britain’s energy regulator, Ofgem, in a move criticised as “putting the fox in charge of the hen house”.The government said Mark McAllister, who founded two oil and gas companies, Fairfield Energy and Acorn Oil & Gas, had “vital expertise” that would help him in the role.The Lib Dems said it was not a suitable choice given McAllister’s history in the oil and gas industry at a time when companies have been criticised for making huge profits on the back of high energy prices. At the same time, households have been struggling with record gas and electricity bills over the last year, with the government providing about £40bn in support for consumers and businesses.Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem energy spokesperson, said the choice of McAllister as the government’s preferred candidate to chair Ofgem showed Sunak was “woefully out of touch”.Ofgem has a duty to champion the interests of consumers who have faced soaring energy bills and its remit was also recently changed to have regard for net zero policies.Labour has said it would end new oil and gas licences in the North Sea but Sunak has committed to new licences that he says are necessary for energy security.McAllister is chair of the nuclear regulator, is involved in charitable causes, and no longer has interests in the oil and gas industry, according to his declared interests at the Office for Nuclear Regulation.Before this job, he was director of a Chinese government-controlled shipping company involved in the offshore oil industry, and founded Fairfield Energy and Acorn Oil & Gas, as well as chairing an industry safety group for the North Sea after BP’s Deepwater Horizon spill. He previously held roles at British Gas and ConocoPhillips, according to his LinkedIn page.Amanda Solloway, the minister for energy consumers and affordability, said McAllister would bring a “strong track record” in the industry to the role.His appointment will be subject to scrutiny by parliament’s committee on energy security and net zero before it is confirmed.“We will always ensure the energy market is working for families to protect them from sky high bills, including by working closely with our partners at Ofgem,” Solloway said.“Mark McAllister has a strong track record of advising governments and regulators on competition and regulation. His expertise will be vital in the years ahead, as we make sure more households have access to cheaper, cleaner energy.”Doug Parr, the policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: “As soon as the energy bill becomes law, Ofgem will have a mandate to pursue an energy system that delivers the carbon budgets under the Climate Change Act. That means a dramatic shift to renewables in electricity and the exclusion of fossil fuels.“We hope that Mr McAllister can put behind him his past engagement with fossil fuels, and more recently nuclear power, and focus on the technologies needed to make this transition happen, which will also be good for consumers. If he is able to do that, we wish him well.”"

Scientists believe the weekend discovery can help them learn more about how the species develops and lives its life.Sexy secret life of basking sharks uncovered in HebridesRead more“Every time we see a whale beaching or a shark washing up, this is like finding a Roman hoard or Viking daggers,” said Dr Ben Garrod, a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of East Anglia. “The oceans cover 71 or 72% of our planet, however it’s still incredibly mysterious.”He told the BBC studying the carcass could offer an insight into feeding patterns and water temperatures, depending on how healthy the shark was prior to its death.The historian Dan Snow is among those to have called for the missing body parts to be returned – even if only temporarily to allow scientists to examine them. “The head, tail and fin were grabbed before I assembled a big enough team to drag it off the beach to the nearest road. We went to secure the shark for science last night. But we were too late,” he said on Twitter.“Please, please – if you have the head get in touch.

Doing so would unlock a host of new powers for the president, including the ability to speed the energy transition and block fossil fuel projects without congressional approval.Biden’s statement outraged climate activists, who noted that it came amid a summer of record-breaking extreme weather events.“This summer, we experienced the hottest days in the past 125,000 years, wildfire smoke has filled the lungs of people across the country, people are losing their homes and literally jumping into the ocean to avoid flames,” Varshini Prakash, executive director of the youth-led climate advocacy group Sunrise Movement, said in a statement.Biden has referred to the climate crisis as an emergency. But in addition to failing to make an official declaration under the National Emergencies Act, he has overseen the expansion of planet-heating fossil fuels, noted Kassie Siegel, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute.“Practically speaking, Biden has devastated communities and wildlife by backing disastrous carbon bombs from Alaska to Appalachia,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those who warned of diminishing supplies were considered catastrophists and investment was postponed.Three consecutive years of drought have almost emptied the reservoir of fresh water, and to avoid shortages the state-run water supplier, OSE, has since the beginning of the year been gradually adding brackish water from the Rio de la Plata estuary.By early May the mix had reached the maximum levels of sodium and chlorides recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), and now it has double those levels, giving the water a repulsive taste and raising questions about potential effects on health.Authorities maintain that the chemicals only affect the taste and smell of the water and do not necessarily pose a risk to most people’s health.Some vulnerable groups such as babies, pregnant women and people with health conditions have been warned against drinking the water but there have been conflicting claims about its safety for the broader population.A protester holds a sign that reads ‘For water, for life’ in Montevideo in May. Photograph: Santiago Mazzarovich/APÁlvaro Mombrú, the dean of the chemistry faculty at the Universidad de la República, said he would not recommend its consumption at present, while his colleague Arturo Briva, the dean of the medicine faculty, said the water was still considered safe but warned that “as levels rise and time of exposure increases, some repercussions may appear”.Experts have advised taking shorter showers, and there have been increased reports of damage to water heaters.A poll in May found that roughly half of people in the area affected had reduced their consumption of tap water and 35% had stopped drinking it completely.The government has exempted bottled water from taxes and announced it would provide free bottled water to more than 500,000 people.Mario Bidegain, a meteorologist, said calculating the amount of rain needed to bring the situation back to normal was a difficult task. If there are heavy rains as expected by early September, authorities will still have to decide whether to reduce the sodium and chloride levels back to normal or keep some kind of mix to preserve supplies in case the drought continues. “We will probably come out of this slowly,” Bidegain said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Licences have been issued for more than 160,000 eggs to be taken from black-headed gull nests since 2019, government data shows, as conservationists call for the eggs to be “taken off all menus”.Each spring, thousands of eggs are collected from the amber-listed seabird’s nests and sold under licences issued by the government’s wildlife watchdog, Natural England. They are considered a delicacy in fine-dining restaurants, known for their creamy yellow yolks and beautiful speckled shells, and can sell for more than £8 each.While delighting gourmet diners, conservationists are concerned that the taste for these eggs is damaging a threatened species, which has a UK breeding population of only 140,000 and is amber-listed by the RSPB.The number of licences awarded in 2022 was at an all-time low of 2,500, but conservationists say that is still too many and egg collecting should stop completely, particularly given the additional pressure birds are under from avian flu.Jeff Knott, the RSPB’s director of policy, said: “With many of our seabird species under increasing pressure from climate change, food availability and bird flu, the collecting of black-headed gull eggs for food is unsustainable, unhelpful and should stop.”Licensing data seen by the Guardian shows that in 2019 more than 60,000 eggs were allowed to be taken, and licences were granted for more than 95,000 in 2020. In 2021, there was a moratorium on taking eggs in Hampshire over concerns about it being unsustainable. As a result, the total number was much lower, with 7,000 licensed to be taken in 2021 and 2,500 in 2022, as the moratorium was maintained.Martin Slater, the deputy chief executive at Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, said: “Many of our once-common wildlife species are in decline, including black-headed gulls, so we’re surprised to see these licences are still being issued in Yorkshire.“We’d like to see these licences finally ending here too, and eggs from these threatened birds permanently taken out of sale and off all menus,” he added.In 2009, a paper published in the journal Acta Oecologica showed that although most black-headed gulls lay more to replace the eggs that are taken, this uses up a lot of energy, which means harvested sites had “poorer hatching success and chick survival”.According to the study, which focused on a colony in Hampshire, the depletion of the female’s reserves also reduced her chances of survival and successfully breeding in the future. Other birds could also be disturbed during collection.The gulls’ eggs are typically sold to wholesalers, large food markets such as Billingsgate in London and high-end restaurants, where they are promoted as a seasonal delicacy. During the 1930s, nearly 300,000 eggs a year were traded in London’s Leadenhall Market.The licensed collectors are known as “eggers”.Dr Malcolm Hudson, an associate professor in environmental science at Southampton University, and a co-author of the Acta Oecologica study, researched the colony in Lymington, Hampshire. He said eggers visited sites daily and took eggs from nests with only one egg to ensure it was less than 24 hours old, systematically working their way through the colony.Hudson said: “I don’t agree with collecting black-headed gull eggs in the UK – they are a bird of conservation concern, protected by our laws, with declining numbers and few thriving breeding sites.“The collection does nothing to enhance our food security – it’s a very small numbers of eggs consumed by a tiny (affluent and well-nourished) portion of our population.”Natural England only grants licences to people who have a “traditional claim”, which generally means it runs in families, particularly among the fishing community. The window for collection is 1 April to 15 May, with a collector being paid £2 to £3 an egg.Stephanie Bird-Halton, the regulatory director at Natural England, said: “Natural England recognises the collection of black-headed gull eggs as a lawful activity, which is licensable under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.Rack of squirrel, anyone? The chefs putting invasive species on the menuRead more“A relatively small number of eggs are harvested annually, which does not negatively impact the population at the national or local scale, given black-headed gulls can produce multiple egg clutches and continue to breed successfully following egg harvesting.”However, conservationists say the practice is hard to monitor.Dr Alexander Lees, a conservation biologist at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: “Although a sustainable harvest of seabird eggs is theoretically possible, this provision opens the door for the sale of illegally harvested eggs – such depredations have been reported at many sites, including Poole harbour, and have impacted non-target species such as the rarer Mediterranean gull, necessitating police protection.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"

        "text": "President Joe Biden will use his executive authority to create a New Deal-style American Climate Corps that will serve as a major green jobs training program.In an announcement on Wednesday, the White House said the program would employ about 20,000 young adults who will build trails, plant trees, help install solar panels and do other work to boost conservation and help prevent catastrophic wildfires.Green investment boom and electric car sales: six key things about Biden’s climate billRead moreBiden had previously been thwarted by Congress on creating a climate corps. The climate corps had been proposed in early versions of the sweeping climate law approved last year but was jettisoned amid strong opposition from Republicans and concerns about cost.Democrats and environmental advocacy groups never gave up on the plan and pushed Biden in recent weeks to issue an executive order authorizing what the White House now calls the American Climate Corps. The program is modeled after the Civilian Conservation Corps, created in the 1930s by the Democratic president Franklin D Roosevelt as part of the New Deal.“This summer, our country saw heat waves, wildfires and floods that destroyed communities, uprooted families and claimed hundreds of lives,” the Sunrise Movement and other organizations wrote on Monday in a letter to Biden’s White House.“While previous executive orders and legislation under your administration demonstrate tremendous progress toward meeting our Paris climate goals and your campaign promises, this summer has made clear that we must be as ambitious as possible in tackling the great crisis of our time,” the groups wrote.More than 50 Democratic lawmakers, including the Massachusetts senator Ed Markey and the New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also encouraged Biden to create a climate corps, saying in a separate letter on Monday that “the climate crisis demands a whole-of-government response at an unprecedented scale”.The lawmakers cited deadly heatwaves in the south-west and across the nation, as well as dangerous floods in New England and devastating wildfires on the Hawaiian island of Maui, among recent examples of climate-related disasters.A federal climate corps would “prepare a whole generation of workers for good-paying union jobs in the clean economy” while helping to “fight climate change, build community resilience and support environmental justice”, the lawmakers wrote.The White House declined to say how much the program will cost or how it will be paid for, but Democrats proposed $10bn for the climate corps in the climate bill before the provision was removed.Republicans have largely dismissed the climate corps as a do-gooder proposal that would waste money and could even take jobs away from other workers displaced by the Covid-19 pandemic.“We don’t need another FDR program, and the idea that this is going to help land management is a false idea as well,” the Arkansas representative Bruce Westerman, chairman of the House natural resources committee, said in 2021.Congressman Joe Neguse, a Colorado Democrat who has co-sponsored a climate corps bill, said it was important to train the next generation of federal land managers, park rangers and other stewards of our natural resources. Neguse and other Democrats have said the program should pay “a living wage” while offering healthcare coverage and support for childcare, housing, transportation and education.A key distinction between the original Civilian Conservation Corps and the new climate contingent is that, unlike the in 1930s, the US economy is not in an economic depression. The US unemployment rate was 3.8% in August, low by historical measures.The new corps is also likely to be far more diverse than the largely white and male force created 90 years ago.The White House climate adviser, Ali Zaidi, said the administration would work with at least six federal agencies to create the climate corps and would pair with at least 10 states. California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan and Washington have already begun similar programs, while five more are launching their own climate corps, Zaidi said: Arizona, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina and Utah.The initiative will provide job training and service opportunities to work on a wide range of projects that tackle the climate crisis, including restoring coastal wetlands to protect communities from storm surges and flooding; deploying clean energy projects such as wind and solar power; managing forests to improve health and prevent catastrophic wildfires; and implementing energy efficient solutions to cut energy bills for consumers, the White House said."

Now, a group of scientists are hoping they have found a way to deplete the UK’s rapidly growing Chinese mitten crab population and prevent the crustaceans, which can grow bigger than a 10-inch dinner plate and have distinctive furry claws, from “eating us out of house and home”.The group has constructed and installed the UK’s first Chinese mitten crab trap at Pode Hole in Lincolnshire, to catch the voracious predators as they migrate downstream to mate.“The mitten crab are eating our native fauna,” said Dr Paul Clark of the Natural History Museum, one of the scientists working on the project. “If we start capturing these crabs and depleting their population, we might see changes in our environment for the better.”This could include an increase in the local population of spined loach, a freshwater fish which is reported to have declined at Pode Hole, along with water voles, bivalve mollusks, small shrimp and snails.The Chinese mitten crab, so-called because it originated in south-east Asia, was first sighted in the UK in 1935. Since then its population has exploded.Wildcats released in Scottish Highlands in effort to prevent extinction in UKRead more“Females can spawn two series of eggs, and they spawn somewhere between 500,000 and one million eggs in one go,” said Clark. “There’s millions in the Thames and huge populations in the Medway, the Ouse Washes, the Dee, Tyneside and the Humber. They are eating us out of house and home.”He described seeing a mitten crab devouring a snail. “The crab treated it like an ice-cream cone. It nipped off the top, pulled the snail out from its shell – and ate it.”Similarly, he said, his students have filmed a mitten crab “crushing an amphipod against the underside of its carapace, and with its other claw, it killed the shrimp and ate it”.Research has shown the crabs also eat salmon and trout eggs – native fish species which are already under threat in the wild.The scientists plan to freeze the crabs they catch, and then hope to be able to dissect them to find out what they have been feeding on. “If we can, we will do some DNA analysis on the digested guts.”The “experimental” trap, which has a unique letterbox construction, was designed by Mick Henfrey, a foreman at the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board, and Oscar Jones, a graduate of the Department of Engineering at the University of Sheffield.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We hope they will climb into the letter box and then up a tube.”He said the trap will be inspected every day and hopes that, if it is successful, other traps can be installed in rivers such as the Dee, an important salmon habitat.The project is being run in conjunction with the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust and the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board.Members of the public are asked to report sightings of Chinese mitten crab online at mittencrabs.org.uk.

        "text": "For Christmas, nine-year-old Molly Sampson and her sister Natalie, 17, asked their parents for one thing: insulated waders, to “go shark’s-tooth hunting like professionals”, said Molly’s mother, Alicia Sampson.When the waders arrived from Santa, Molly told the Guardian, she declared that she would be looking “for a Meg”, or megalodon tooth, and ventured to Maryland’s Calvert Beach to hunt fossils on Christmas Day with Natalie and their father, Bruce Sampson.Molly said she was hoping to find teeth and other fossils to make necklaces, once the family gets more jewelry-making supplies.There, wading in low tide amid 10F weather, Molly scored big: a 5in tooth of the Otodus megalodon shark species.Molly Sampson with her family. Photograph: Courtesy Sampson Family“I was amazed,” said Molly, who said she knew what she had found after learning different fossil shapes from her dad.“My dad said I was, like, shrieking and screaming.”“She said she got her arms all wet, but it was so worth it. The look on her face is the only thing that makes me regret not going with them because I can’t even imagine the shriek that came from her mouth,” Sampson told CBS News.“I’m excited for her,” said Natalie with a laugh. “A little jealous.”The family took Molly’s discovery to the Calvert Marine Museum, which confirmed it was indeed an ancient shark tooth, from the now-extinct megalodon, a type of shark that lived in seas across the world until it died out approximately 3.5m years ago.The megalodon was regarded as one of the largest sharks in the world, and possibly the largest fish to ever exist, growing to more than 66ft in length.Molly has reportedly found more than 400 teeth during her fossil hunts, Alicia Sampson told CBS, picking up the childhood passion of her father, who also hunted fossils as a kid.“She has always wanted to find a meg, but for whatever reason, she spoke it into existence on Christmas morning,” Alicia said.Stephen Godfrey, curator of paleontology at the Calvert Marine Museum, lauded Molly’s discovery as a “once-in-a-lifetime kind of find”.“Her find is wonderful because she has an interest in paleontology and this will propel her and others her age to explore the sciences,” Godfrey told CBS.Molly said she loves fossils because “they’re cool”.“[They’re] from a long time ago. They’re cool. They’re old and historical.”Despite Molly’s avid interest in fossils and the outdoors, her mother suspects she may choose a a different career path, perhaps involving music.“She is also very good at the violin, and said she may want to teach violin like I do for a living. So she might turn out to be a good mix of her father and I if she can somehow do both,” said Alicia.With the megalodon tooth in Molly’s bedroom amid her other fossil hunting finds, Molly said that many people in the neighborhood have come by to see the tooth, including her friends who are also amazed by her discovery.“They’ve been really excited that I found it.”"

But snow in May is not always a good indicator of the snow season to come, Hines said. Warm and rainy conditions in recent days have melted much of that snow away.Bureau of Meteorology puts Australia on ‘El Niño alert’Read moreMany alpine regions had seen significant snowfall in late May last year, but Hines said it is not uncommon to have little snow in early June.“Most years the alpine areas don’t begin to build their snow base until June and sometimes later.”A brief surge of showers is forecast for Friday, which could bring a dusting of snow to areas above 1,400m, but “no significant snow is expected”. There is also no snow forecast through the long weekend.From next Tuesday, the next frontal system will move overhead. “Although at this stage, that system doesn’t look like it will bring much or any snowfall,” Hines said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What started in 1947 as a personal project, driven by a simple love of nature, turned out to demonstrate with textbook clarity that the long-term trend in Britain has been for spring to start much earlier than it used to. Her 76-year dataset has been used by scientists in climate change modelling, and earned her national recognition in 2009 with appointment as an OBE for services to phenology, the study of periodic events in biological life cycles.Jean’s data first came to the attention of scientists in 1995, when she read about the work of the climate expert Tim Sparks, and contacted him about what she had been doing. Tim later described her records as “probably unique in phenological recording and, as far as we know, the longest recording by a single person anywhere in the world”.Drawing of a dog rose (Rosa canina) by Jean CombesBorn in south London to Ernest Laney, an insurance salesman, and Dorothy (nee Martin), a seamstress, Jean acquired her interest in the natural world when she was evacuated to the countryside with her sister, Pauline, at the start of the second world war. First they lived in Hertfordshire and then in Sussex.After being educated at Chichester girls grammar school she went on to work as a housing manager at various local authorities in the London area. While at Merton council she met Reg Combes, a payroll clerk, and they married in 1951.After raising three daughters as a full-time mother, Jean completed a three-year field biology qualification at London University in 1977. This was the springboard for 25 years of teaching natural history adult education classes, first for the WEA in Surrey, then at Surrey University in Guildford and for the Field Studies Council.Jean also undertook survey work, including 20 years of the common bird census on Ashtead common in Surrey, and was commissioned by the Local Agenda 21 Committee for Surrey to carry out a study of a proposed oil pipeline route through Surrey and Sussex, which got the go-ahead only on the basis that hundreds of rare wild daffodils identified by her were first transplanted to safety.She was involved with a number of wildlife bodies, including on the committees of the Surrey Wildlife Trust and of the City of London body that manages Ashtead Common. After the award of her OBE there was considerable media interest in her exploits, and she appeared on The One Show in 2009 and Springwatch in 2010.Her fine pencil drawings of tree buds, catkins and leaves were exhibited annually for 10 years at the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland. She also had a love for Scottish landscapes, literature, poetry and art, and remained interested in politics and the state of the world.Reg died in 2006. She is survived by her daughters, Sue and me, and four grandchildren, Alex, Lewis, Joe and Jenna. Another daughter, Jenny, died in 2018."

Turnips are good but they’ll probably have to get them from us, he said.Putin’s remarks had a thin veneer of truth. Although Coffey said people should “cherish” specialist British produce, she seemed unaware that Britain’s biggest turnip grower was in her constituency – and had stopped growing them months earlier.00:01:09No tomatoes? What about turnips? suggests environment secretary – videoAW Mortier, near Alderton in Suffolk, had a near monopoly on the few turnips available in supermarkets but gave up in September last year because of stores’ unwillingness to pay higher prices to make up for rising costs of energy and fertiliser.“It just wasn’t worth them doing it,” said Andrew Thorogood, the managing director of S Thorogood and sons, a leading wholesaler that specialises in traditional English fruit and vegetables.“They were tied into all the supermarkets, and being tied down terribly. The open-market price is much higher than the supermarkets are prepared to pay – that’s quite a normal thing these days.”He said there were “two or three” other growers who served independent retailers and restaurants. “Most of our turnips now come from either these two or three growers or France. We import probably 70 or 80% of our product from France, and more and more from Spain and Portugal.”Despite their soemtimes bitter taste and punchline status, turnips had made a minor comeback in the last few years, Thorogood said. “They’re very useful in Asian cooking. It keeps its consistency.” But imports of mooli – a long, white radish – had been replacing turnips, he said.Environment secretary Thérèse Coffey. Photograph: Henry Nicholls/ReutersFarmers are not only cutting back on turnips – they’re devoting less land to potatoes, leeks and brassicas, with some reducing acreage by 25%.Andrew Burgess, chair of the National Farmers’ Union organics forum, said the cost crisis would mean that the proportion of produce grown in the UK – currently about 60% – would fall. “Our level of self-sufficiency is going to be probably the lowest ever recorded, probably below 50% this year. That’s pretty scary when you think about geopolitics at the moment.”Thorogood said that UK supermarkets insist on long-term contracts, which means that growers don’t get any benefit when prices go up but have to absorb costs such as fertiliser and energy. French and German supermarkets set prices for growers every Thursday, so prices rise when crops are in short supply, he said.Supermarkets in France were charging €3.50 for a cauliflower last week, he said. “A cauliflower in Aldi in Chelmsford was 88p. When everyone is struggling with their bills, they look like the good guys. But they are crucifying the producer base.”Will Golding, a farmer in Lancashire, said he stopped growing turnips some time ago. His electricity bill had risen from £50,000 to £125,000.Should we cherish our turnips? Why the British food system may need a rebootRead more“We’re a small family farm,” he said. “We’re kicking and screaming to get an extra penny a pack.”Last year, Sustain, the alliance of food and farming organisations, found that farmers were making less than a penny in profit, which its director of sustainable farming, Vicki Hird, said showed that the UK’s food system was “no longer fit for purpose”.“We need to transition for climate- and nature-friendly farming, and farmers can’t do that if they’re not getting proper rewards,” she said.Defra did not comment on whether Coffey knew that Mortiers had stopped growing turnips. A spokesperson said UK growers were “crucial to the resilience of our food system”, and the government knew that farmers were “facing global pressures, including from the invasion of Ukraine”.“The UK has a highly resilient food chain and is well equipped to deal with disruption,” they said.“Our new farming schemes will support farmers to produce food profitably and sustainably, including £600m in grants for equipment to help farmers become more productive.“This is part of the significant action we have taken to support the sector so far, alongside allocating 45,000 seasonal workers and wider government support on energy bills through the Energy Bills Relief Scheme.” This article was amended on 20 March 2023.

Two frigate birds and one red-footed booby were confirmed to have died from the virus on Tuesday, after samples were sent to Guayaquil on the Ecuadorian mainland for examination.Park guards and veterinarians are redoubling efforts to protect the islands’ 78 species of endemic and native birds, including flightless cormorants, the only species of penguin in the northern hemisphere and one of the largest albatross colonies in the world.The Galápagos Islands’ unique bird species were observed by Charles Darwin in 1835 when he visited the isolated archipelago on HMS Beagle and helped him set out his theory of evolution by natural selection in On the Origin of Species. They are considered particularly vulnerable due to their low immunity, small populations and the effect of rising ocean temperatures.Scientists say the virus was probably brought to the islands by migratory birds. Last year, Ecuador declared an emergency due to outbreaks of avian influenza on farms. In neighbouring Peru, the highly contagious virus ripped through seabird populations, killing as many as 200,000 as well as decimating marine mammals such as sea lions.National park technicians examine birds on Genovesa Island. Photograph: Parque Nacional Galápagos/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Galápagos national park activated emergency health protocols on Sunday following the report of dozens of dead and sick birds on two islands, Wolf and Genovesa, in the northern part of the Pacific archipelago, which lies about 1,000km from the South American continent.Rueda said red-footed boobies were showing a “higher number of dead birds but also more symptoms [such as] erratic behaviour” characteristic of bird flu.Two visitor sites were closed on Española Island, the only place where the critically endangered waved albatross breeds, though there were no confirmed cases of the birds with the virus.“Our main worry is for the endemic species,” said Rueda. “Their populations are quite small and are restricted to the Galápagos.”“It is very worrying to find a dead bird or a bird that has given a positive result, so we have to triple the biosecurity efforts on tourist boats, for tourists and crew members,” he said.Gustavo Jiménez, principal investigator for the Charles Darwin Foundation, said many species including boobies, albatross and the endangered Galápagos penguin were facing scarcer food sources due to El Niño, and the resulting stress made them more susceptible to pathogens such as avian flu.“The endemic species are very sensitive to any disease,” he said. “Our best defence is prevention.”Scientists also fear that, as it has on the mainland, the virus could jump to endangered Galápagos sea lions and fur seals.A warning has been issued calling on tourists visiting the Unesco Natural Heritage of Humanity site not to try to touch affected birds. Avian influenza can be transmitted to humans.Federico Angermeyer, a tour operator in the archipelago, said the disease’s landfall could hurt tourism, the islands’ principal economic activity.“The impact of the [Covid-19] pandemic is not over and bird flu is going to be another big blow,” he said by phone."

        "text": "The forest chorus of South Sumatra in Indonesia has some of its finest singers back: a pair of rare Siamang gibbons, rescued from the illegal pet trade, have been released into the wild.Siamang gibbons (Symphalangus syndactylus) are known for their distinctive large throat sacs. But their powerful, haunting voices, used for communication and marking territory, are a blessing and a curse.“Gibbons are one of the most popular primates for pets in the illegal wildlife trade and Siamangs are one of the biggest targets because of their beautiful forest singing,” said Made Wedana, country director for the Indonesia programme of the Aspinall Foundation wildlife charity.“All gibbons sing, but Siamangs are the loudest. They’re also very beautiful animals, and … very rare in the wild.”Gibbons are popular targets for the illegal wildlife trade, with Siamangs prized for their beauty and powerful singing voices. Photograph: The Aspinall FoundationSiamang gibbons are found in rainforests in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. But the illegal pet trade – alongside habitat loss from plantations, mining and logging – means numbers in the wild are declining, and they are listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List.In 2023, the Aspinall Foundation completed work on a rehabilitation centre in Punti Kayu, South Sumatra – the first of its kind to rehabilitate Siamang gibbons and return them to the wild. On 23 December, the first pair, Jon and Cimung, were released.Jon and Cimung being prepared for release. ‘They took to their surroundings very naturally,’ says Made Wedana. Photograph: The Aspinall Foundation“Both of them were kept as pets. Jon’s condition was extremely bad – he had severe diarrhoea and was acutely malnourished. We were concerned he wouldn’t survive,” Wedana said.The rehabilitation process took five years. Siamangs often have to learn how to find food in the wild and defend themselves from predators. There’s also a pair-bonding process, which gives them a better chance of surviving among other territorial gibbons in the area.“Siamangs are monogamous – they pair for life,” said Amos Courage, director of overseas projects for the Aspinall Foundation. “But pair-bonding can be tricky. In enclosures, gibbons can seem bonded, but once released they don’t always get on.”Wedana, who accompanied the pair to their release, said it went perfectly. “The two Siamangs took to their surroundings very naturally and in the afternoon they started calling, which is a hugely positive sign.”The team will now monitor the gibbons on foot for about four months to make sure they are able to fend for themselves. If all goes well, other wild-born Siamangs rescued from the pet trade will be released in South Sumatra.Siamangs are found crammed into small cages for sale, alongside other wild animals, at markets in towns and cities across Indonesia, as well as online. They are often infants, whose parents were killed so their offspring could be stolen and sold.“It’s a miserable existence,” said Courage. “An animal used to swinging through vast primary forest is shoved in an enclosure, usually in someone’s small house in an urban area, and given completely inappropriate food.The gibbons will be monitored for four months to make sure they are coping with life in the wild.

They pick up diseases and sometimes come to us badly traumatised,” he said.I discovered … chimps using tools – and people wouldn’t believe meRead moreKeeping protected species is illegal in Indonesia. But enforcement of those laws is limited, Courage said, with a lack of equipped sanctuaries that can quarantine and conduct health checks on confiscated animals.“Deforestation is also exacerbating the issue because you have people going into areas they wouldn’t have gone to before and coming across wild animals,” Courage added. “Frequently, the animals are killed and eaten or caught and sold as pets.”The most effective way to protect Siamang gibbons is to reduce demand, Wedana added. “In Sumatra, not many people are aware of this sad situation,” said Wedana, who is helping to develop a public education project. “In the future, it will be better if there’s no need for this rehabilitation centre.”\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X (formerly known as Twitter) for all the latest news and features\n"

        "text": "The movie adaptation of Tim Winton’s novel Blueback is out this week. It focuses on a friendship with a big friendly fish – the blue groper; and the powerful response to humans threatening the animal. As with My Octopus Teacher, it’s a highly emotive story, and seen by most people as unusual or unique. Because humans only befriend domestic animals such as cats and dogs. Or do they?Let’s start with the blue groper. This is a charismatic Australian native, with many interesting characteristics. They are protogynous hermaphrodites, starting life as juveniles with the potential to be male or female; and always starting as green-coloured females. The dominant male has a harem and, if he dies, the largest female will become male and adopt the striking blue hue which gives the fish its name. These fish can live up to 70 years and are the state emblem of New South Wales.Blueback review – Tim Winton adaptation hammers home its climate messageRead moreBeyond the science, these are extraordinarily curious and friendly fish. As a regular snorkeller and diver, I am often greeted by a groper who will shove his face in my camera, rub up against my hands, bop me with his lips and follow me around. Gropers appear to recognise divers and are curious about what we are doing. It is illegal to spear these animals in my home state but such is my emotional response to their friendliness, I can imagine jumping in front of a weapon aimed at one of my friends.Octopuses are similarly interactive and interested in us. They are invertebrates who have developed unique, extraordinary intelligence, diverging from us evolutionarily more than 600m years ago. They use tools and mimicry, construct shelters, steal things and are known to be escape artists when kept in captivity.In Sydney we primarily interact with the gloomy octopus (Octopus tetricus). One of my life’s highlights was the first time one of these creatures unfurled a tentacle and explored my hand. Since then I’ve had many interactions, including octopuses riding on my hand, trying desperately to steal my camera, and some who tell me to go away by blowing sand at me. Unfortunately, octopuses don’t live long – usually becoming senescent after breeding and lasting only one to two years. The ones we see regularly are often eaten by smooth stingrays in the blink of an eye. It’s hard to get too fond of them as the end is always near.Once you have a relationship and an attachment to another living creature, they become part of your sphere of compassionMoving to the land, and most of us are familiar with wild birds seeking human company. Yes, they are often after food, but who isn’t? My neighbourhood is dominated by sulphur-crested cockatoos, but it only takes a little patience to have a rainbow lorikeet or a king parrot work up the courage to stand on a human hand.Even tiny insects can notice humans and change their behaviour to interact with us. Jumping spiders are in almost everyone’s garden but you might miss them if you don’t look hard. Most are less than half a centimetre long. Lock eyes with one, however, and there’s no doubt that they see you, moving their bodies to make eye contact. Also fans of cameras, they sometimes jump right at you!Relationships with wild animals are possible and common – you can have your own Blueback or My Octopus Teacher experience. Return to the same place often enough and you’ll get to know the regulars. Getting to know animals as individuals with varying personalities and behaviour grants them elevated importance. But be aware that it is likely to push you closer to vegetarianism and inspire you towards conservation. Because once you have a relationship and an attachment to another living creature, they become part of your sphere of compassion. And then there is no choice but to protect both the animal and its environment. A “pet” blue groper or a labrador? You can have both, and it will probably make you a better human.\nKate Ahmad is a neurologist and diver with an interest in human and animal behaviour and conservation\n"

        "text": "Tortoise and turtle shells can be used to study nuclear contamination, scientists have found.Just as tree rings can provide snapshots of the Earth’s climate, and ice cores can give us information on past temperature, researchers found that the layers of shells can be used as a time stamp of periods with nuclear fallout.Research published in the scientific journal PNAS Nexus investigates how uranium builds up in the outer shells of chelonians, the order of reptiles that includes tortoises and turtles.“When we consider the legacies of 20th century nuclear deployment, testing, and production, we must now also consider chelonians and their lived experience in areas where these activities occurred,” the research stated.The researchers focused on turtles and tortoises from areas that have seen nuclear contamination, and measured the uranium that was present in the scute, the bony outer shell that is usually made of keratin. Each layer of shell equates to one year of its life, and so can reveal what happened in the tortoise’s surrounding environment.Five different chelonians from natural history collections were studied. One of these came from Enewetak Atoll, and was collected in 1978. Enewetak Atoll and its neighbour, Bikini Atoll, in the Pacific, were the site of 67 nuclear tests, with Enewetak the site of 43 of these. Though the sea turtle was probably not alive during the time of the testing, researchers still found uranium contamination in the turtle 20 years after testing ended.However, consumption of uranium-contaminated algae, or other legacy contamination present in the atoll, may have contributed to the presence of uranium in that turtle.Researchers also looked at an eastern box turtle from Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in the US. Oak Ridge is the site of a nuclear facility that has produced and processed uranium since 1943. The turtle that was studied from there was collected in 1962 and may have bioaccumulated radionuclides, or radioactive materials, from uranium waste products in the area.The researchers were able to identify uranium isotopic composition across the scute from these turtles.The research supports the idea that these animals can bioaccumulate human-made radionuclides, or from the environment. It also supports the idea that these animals, which often live a long time, can record information about human activity with nuclear landscapes over a long period.“We anticipate that combining analyses of historically collected and modern specimens will significantly expand our environmental monitoring abilities as they relate to ongoing nuclear contamination questions,” the study said."

        "text": "The British Heart Foundation (BHF), which has campaigned on the pollution risks of burning wood at home, is being urged to review a charity draw for a £3m London townhouse, with a fire pit on the garden terrace and open fires in the property.A promotional video shows wood being burned in the metal fire pit at the property in north London and an open fire next to a bath. “Take a soak in your sumptuous stone tub and relax to the crackling sounds of the roaring fireplace,” says the promotion.The BHF has been at the forefront of the campaign to highlight the risk of open fires. New data published last year found wood burning in homes produces more small particle pollution than all road traffic in the UK.The draw has been promoted widely by the charity in partnership with Omaze, a for-profit fundraising company, in which 15 entries can be bought for £10 and 320 entries can be bought for £150.Jemima Hartshorn, founder and director of Mums for Lungs, said the BHF’s decision to raise money in this way was “regrettable and highlights a lack of awareness of the link between wood-burning, air pollution and health”.A BHF spokesperson said: “Omaze, who run the Million Pound House Draw, are urgently reviewing this issue and we await the outcome of that review.“As the UK’s leading heart health charity, we have campaigned for legislation to address the health harms caused by air pollution, including its damaging impact on the heart and circulatory system.”The property being marketed by the BHF is in Islington, north London, which is a smoke-control zone where it is an offence to burn unauthorised fuel. Householders can be fined up to £1,000 for burning fuel without an exempt appliance.The website for the mayor of London warns: “Open fireplaces are the most polluting way to burn solid fuels and pose the greatest risk to health and so should be avoided.”While total annual emissions in the UK of the pollutant PM2.5, which are small particles hazardous to health, have fallen in recent years, there has been an increase in emissions from wood burning because of the popularity of wood-burning stoves and open fires.The townhouse offered in the draw has four bedrooms, a garden studio and outdoor seating area. A video on the BHF website, promoted by chief executive Dr Charmaine Griffiths, shows what appears to be wood burning in the outside fire pit and a fire burning in the living room, with wooden logs stored in a nearby container.The BHF has campaigned to warn people of the risks from wood burning. “Few people know that for every minute we spend warming ourselves by the fire, tiny toxic air pollution particles known as PM2.5 are being released into the air, causing harm to our health,” the charity said in a blog in March 2020.The government introduced restrictions in May 2021 on the sale of coal, wet wood and manufactured solid fuels for burning in the home. The BHF said at the time the policy was “a step in the right direction” but that the government needed to move faster to tackle all sources of air pollution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The costs of purchasing the house and marketing fees are deducted from the gross proceeds. Omaze has guaranteed a minimum total payment of £100,000 for the BHF, and the draw closes for online entries on 26 February.A previous Omaze draw in 2021 for a four-storey property in south-west London raised £1m for the BHF. The charity said the partnership with Omaze had provided vital income at a time when donations were adversely affected by the pandemic.Omaze, which has its headquarters in Los Angeles, offers participants the chance to win prizes, including properties, expensive cars and holidays, with a proportion of the proceeds going to charity. The BHF said Omaze has raised £100m that has gone to support more than 350 charities around the world.The venture was founded in 2012 by Matt Pohlson and Ryan Cummins, and has been described as a “celebrity-endorsed juggernaut”. U2 singer Bono and American footballer Tom Brady are reported to be among its investors.Omaze said it would review the promotion and “take any appropriate action”. A spokesperson said: “We take our environmental responsibilities very seriously.”"

        "text": "Deteriorating flood defences mean more than 200,000 homes in England are at risk of flooding, with MPs blaming Environment Agency budget shortfalls.A report by MPs on the public accounts committee said the EA had failed to meet a target of maintaining 98% of “high consequence” flood defences. The agency has had to downgrade the number of properties it aims to protect by 2027 from 336,000 to 200,000.New houses were being built on floodplains without checks being carried out to make sure suitable flood defences had been put in place, the MPs said. They described the failure as “unforgivable”.Some 5.7 million properties were at risk of flooding in England in 2022 and 2023 and this number is expected to increase as climate breakdown brings more intense downpours more often.Flooding across the UK earlier this month damaged nearly 2,000 properties.Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, deputy chair of the Commons committee, said robust flood resilience must become a priority.“The depredations caused by such disasters are a matter of life and death for communities up and down the country,” he said. “This inquiry has uncovered the alarming truth that in a number of ways, the approach to keeping our citizens safe in this area is contradictory and self-defeating, not least in the continuing development of new housing in areas of high flood risk without appropriate mitigations.”The committee said the government should set a measure of how many properties were protected from flooding that took into account the number with poor defences, as well as new constructions.It should also ensure that smaller projects found it easier to get approval so that rural villages had the same right to protection as others, they said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This is emblematic both of the government’s failure to strike the right balance between maintenance and construction, and of not considering the net number of properties at risk.“One of the first steps in delivering any successful policy is clearly defining what success looks like. We hope the recommendations in our report help the government to do so.”Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrats’ housing, communities and local government spokesperson, said: “Areas like mine in Shropshire have had to face year after year of inundation with virtually no support, and what there is is only set to dwindle, ruining more lives.“Under this Conservative government, flood protection plans have been shamefully neglected – and ordinary people’s homes and businesses are being turned upside down as a result.“Enough is enough. The Conservatives must get a grip and give communities like mine the support we deserve.”The government has said its aim was to create “a nation more resilient to future flood and coastal erosion risk”, but the report found there was no numerical target in place, meaning it could not quantify how much progress was being made on this."

        "text": "When Jealous Mpofu was a boy, he overheard his father’s bosses talking negatively about painted dogs, wild African canines with distinct marble coats that are among the world’s most endangered species.“They said they didn’t kill an animal, they grabbed the flesh. They said they were rough animals,” Mpofu said.His father was a farm labourer on the edge of Hwange national park in Zimbabwe. Painted dogs, contrary to what the bosses of Mpofu’s father said, are not scavengers. Nor are they hyenas, which are much larger, only distantly related and steal their prey. But farmers still shoot them. Conservationists and tourists show little interest in them. Poachers aiming for antelopes ensnare them. Cars run them over.Starved of habitat, maligned and hunted, painted dogs have plummeted in number from an estimated half a million to fewer than 7,000, surviving on the edge of oblivion in a few pockets of southern Africa. Scientists believe climate change threatens to wipe them out completely. As underdogs go, they are hard to beat.Jealous Mpofu. Photograph: TuskBut they do have some friends, and none more friendly than the man who has been recognised by the charity Tusk as its ranger of the year for his work over a quarter of a century bringing these curious animals back from the brink.Mpofu, 54, had never seen a painted dog until 1997, he said in an interview from his office to reveal news of his award. He grew up trekking barefoot to school and worked for years as a casual labourer in Zimbabwe’s national park system, but left the job when he saw the country “going down”.His life changed when he met Peter Blinston, a Briton who founded Painted Dog Conservation after learning about the animals in a Jane Goodall documentary at the age of eight.Mpofu became the charity’s first ranger, and as money trickled in he crisscrossed Hwange searching for dogs, often walking 20 miles to the nearest mechanic when the charity’s one vehicle broke down.Tragedy struck in 2006 when the alpha male in Hwange’s last pack was killed and the group dispersed. Mpofu and the team brought the alpha female into a new rehabilitation enclosure. For six months Hwange had no painted dogs in the wild.They released the female and chose an alpha male from the enclosure. In the years that followed the female dog raised as many as 30 puppies. “Now we are following some of these offspring,” he said. “So we did a nice job.”Mpofu is in charge of six rangers who track the five packs the project looks after. Together they amount to between 150 and 200 dogs, roaming more than 1,000 square miles. Each morning he wakes at 4am and heads off into the bush with his radio equipment, sometimes staying days at a time and alerting anti-poaching units to sweep an area for snares when he finds a pack. He knows each of his dogs by the unique markings on their left and right sides.Blinston credits Mpofu with saving dozens of dogs’ lives. Last year he found four in one pack ensnared together. “One by one, as I found them, we got the snares off,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Mpofu is having a classroom built at his old school and has begun to teach rural children his skills.This month he will fly to London to receive his prize, most likely from Prince William, who helped to establish the awards in 2013. Mpofu said he shivered with shock when Blinston told him he had won.He was not aware that he would be receiving a grant of £30,000, and laughed when he was told. He said he would spend it on his wife Tendai and family, but also the community.“I need to show to other people as well that if you get the money you give a little bit to other people,” Mpofu said. “I share that with painted dogs.” They regurgitate food for each other, and puppies get first dibs on meat.“They are not selfish like lions,” Mpofu said. “They always share.”"

        "text": "Rooftop solar is on track for another near-record annual installation tally as households seek to beat rising power prices with new or bigger photovoltaic systems.In the first six months of 2023, households and businesses added about 1.46 gigawatts of new solar capacity in small-scale systems, about a fifth higher than a year earlier, according to Green Energy Markets. For June alone, almost 250 megawatts of new capacity went on to rooftops, 13.2% more than for the same month in 2022.Higher electricity prices in the past year have stoked demand for solar panels, the director of analysis and advisory at Green Energy Markets, Tristan Edis, said. With a further increase of as much as 25% being imposed from this month, 2021’s record for new capacity of about 3.2GW set in 2021 may come close to being broken. Illustration: Green Energy Markets“It’s tracking at the second highest it’s ever been,” Edis said. “I think it’s going to continue to be a robust year in terms of sales because of power prices … and by the end of the year, [new capacity] is probably going be similar to what it was in 2021.”Australia risks failing on renewable energy – but two steps could help fix that | Adam MortonRead moreAustralia has the world’s highest per-capita solar energy penetration, with almost one in three homes hosting PV panels.

        "text": "One of the largest goldmines in the world has been ordered to take immediate action or face further regulatory action after test results showed the mine’s main vent is releasing “an unacceptable level of dust”.The New South Wales Environment Protection Authority said on Wednesday it told Newcrest’s Cadia mine that it must comply immediately with the Protection of the Environment Operations (Clean Air) Regulation 2022, the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997, and its environment protection licence.It comes one month after the EPA launched its investigation into the Cadia Hill goldmine in central west NSW, after dozens of local residents, including children, reported blood tests with high levels of selenium, nickel and copper.EPA begins free rainwater testing near Cadia goldmine Read moreThe test results, provided by Cadia on 6 June, were in response to the EPA’s previous prevention notice issued to Newcrest late last month regarding its management of “emissions of dust and other pollutants”.The EPA chief executive officer, Tony Chappel, said Newcrest’s Cadia mine continued to fall well short of its legal obligations to meet clean air standards.“We know this is strong action, but we will not shy away from doing what we must to prioritise human health and the environment,” he said.“We require the mine to take all necessary steps to ensure dust emissions are significantly reduced and this may include a reduction in production.”\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nChappel said if Newcrest cannot show its subsidiary, Cadia Holdings Pty Ltd, is taking immediate action to comply, the EPA will take appropriate action which could include suspension of the licence, seeking court orders or issuing further directions.The EPA said several new conditions had also been included in the licence variation to address community and environmental concerns about impacts on air quality. Cadia would be required to do a number of things including undertaking vent emission monitoring regularly and providing additional reports on lead dust fingerprinting research, an analysis of dust impacts and sources, an independent health risk analysis, and an updated air quality impact assessment.An estimated 1,000 people who live within a 15km radius of the mine and rely on rainwater for drinking could have heavy metals in their water supply.The EPA said it would continue conducting its free rainwater testing for residents living near the mine as part of its broader monitoring program. It follows five rounds of water testing in an independent laboratory as part of a citizen survey, organised and led by the Cadia Community Sustainability Network.

        "text": "An area of mountain forest larger than the state of Texas has been lost since 2001, with the amount disappearing each year accelerating at an “alarming” rate, a study warns.Scientists found 78m hectares (193m acres) of mountain forest have been lost across the world in the past two decades, which is more than 7% of all that exists. The main drivers of loss were logging, the expansion of agriculture and wildfires.Mountains are home to more than 85% of the world’s birds, mammals and amphibians. These habitats were once more protected than their lowland equivalents because their rugged terrain made them less accessible, the paper notes. Today, they are increasingly threatened as humans exploit harder-to-reach areas of the planet, and lowland forests are given greater protection.Map of mountain forest loss“Our global analysis of mountain forest loss identifies an alarming acceleration over the past two decades,” the researchers, led by scientists from the University of Leeds and the Southern University of Science and Technology in China, wrote in the paper, published in the journal One Earth.They found that logging was responsible for 42% of mountain forest loss, wildfires for 29%, slash-and-burn cultivation 15% and semi-permanent or permanent agriculture 10%.The researchers tracked changes in forests between 2001 and 2018, documenting both increases and decreases in tree cover, and working out possible impacts on biodiversity. They found that Asia, South America, Africa, Europe and Australia were all badly affected. Much of the loss in northern Asia was due to wildfires, especially in large parts of Russia. Droughts and bushfires led to significant losses in Australia.The annual rate of loss rose sharply after 2010, increasing by 50% in 2010-2018 compared with 2001-2009. Expansion of agriculture and logging in the highland areas of south-east Asia was found to be a key driver. During the period of study, more than half of global forest loss happened in Asia.The climate crisis is putting pressure on specialist – and often sensitive – mountain wildlife, as warmer temperatures force species to move to higher ground. At some point, they are likely to run out of suitable habitats, a process known as the “escalator to extinction”.Previous studies have shown that alpine plants are not keeping up with climate breakdown, with invasive species colonising the tops of mountains faster. Botanists working in the Scottish Highlands also found Britain’s rarest mountain plants were retreating higher.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Zhenzhong Zeng from Southern University of Science and Technology, one of the paper’s authors, said: “What needs our attention is that mountain forest loss has encroached on areas of known high conservation value to terrestrial biodiversity, especially in the tropics. Various types of agriculture expansion and forestry activities are key drivers there.”The paper found that creating protected areas within biodiversity hotspots lowered the rate of loss. “Increasing the area of protection in mountains should be central to preserving montane forests and biodiversity in the future,” it said.Dr Marco Mina, a researcher at the Institute for Alpine Environment, Eurac Research, in Italy, who was not involved in the study, said: “My overall opinion is that the use of large-scale data such as remote-sensing satellite products are a great tool to monitor forest change in almost real time. However, we should be cautious to draw global conclusions based solely on remote-sensing products.“A forest that is well managed through a careful planning process can still provide high levels of habitat for plants and animal species.” The headline of this article was amended on 20 March 2023 to remove a reference to “alpine” wildlife.

As a result, nutrient-rich poop remains along the ocean surface and creates plankton blooms, which capture carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and drag it to the ocean floor when they die. And sperm whales in Dominica are believed to defecate more than whales elsewhere, said Shane Gero, a whale biologist and founder of the Dominica Sperm Whale Project, a research program focused on sperm whales in the eastern Caribbean.It is unclear why sperm whales seem to defecate more in Dominica. Gero said it could be they are eating twice as much, or maybe there is something particular about the type of squid they are eating.“In some respects, sperm whales are fighting climate change on our behalf,” Gero said in an interview.Fewer than 500 sperm whales are estimated to live in the waters surrounding Dominica, part of a population that moves along the Lesser Antilles chain, swimming as far south as St Vincent and north into Guadeloupe. Unlike sperm whales elsewhere in the world, the ones around the eastern Caribbean do not travel very far, Gero said.He noted that sperm whales are a matrilineal society, with young males leaving and switching oceans at some point in their lives. As a result, protecting the species is key, especially if few female calves are born, he said.“One calf being entangled can mean the end of a family,” he said.Sperm whales can produce a single calf every five to seven years.In waters around Dominica and elsewhere, sperm whales have been hit by ships, entangled in fishing gear and affected by agricultural runoff, limiting their survival. In the pre-whaling days, an estimated 2 million sperm whales roamed the Earth’s deep waters before they were hunted for oil used to burn lamps and lubricate machinery. Now, some 800,000 are left, Gero said.The government of Dominica said the reserve would allow sustainable artisanal fishing and delineate an international shipping lane to avoid more deaths of sperm whales, which have the largest brain of an animal species in the world and can grow up to 50ft (15 meters).Once the reserve is created, the prime minister said his administration will appoint an officer and observers to ensure the area is respected and that whale tourism regulations are enforced. Visitors can still swim with sperm whales and see them from a boat, but in limited numbers.The move was praised by scientists and conservationists including Enric Sala, an explorer-in-residence at National Geographic.“The government of Dominica has realized that the sperm whales, which were probably here before humans, are also citizens of Dominica,” he said. “These whales will spend most of the year offshore the island. So, they are taking care of some of their citizens in a way that few nations have ever done before.”An estimated 35 families of sperm whales spend most of their time in waters surrounding Dominica. Gero said some are probably more than 60 years old, and they communicate via clicking sounds in a vocalization known as codas.“That’s kind of like asking, ‘I’m from Dominica, are you?’” Gero said. “It’s a symbolic marker.”"

Varma was hiking with a party of six people and about halfway through their walk through the inner canyon, the lowest part of the hike, he became unresponsive. Emergency crews were called and bystanders began CPR, according to a press release from the national park service (NPS).Phoenix sets record in hellishly hot summer – but relief is in sightRead moreRescuers flew a helicopter to the area but attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful.“It definitely is a tragic circumstance. No one comes to the Grand Canyon thinking something like this would occur to them,” said Joelle Baird, a public affair specialist for the NPS.Varma was on his way to the last leg of the “rim to rim” hike, a grueling journey that can take between 12-15 hours with thousands of feet gained in elevation. Each section has a unique elevation, temperature and landscape, making the hike incredibly rigorous and dangerous for people who are unprepared or haven’t done physical conditioning first.While it is unclear what Varma’s exact cause of death was, Baird emphasized the rigorous nature of the hike combined with the recent heatwaves makes it a dangerous time to attempt such an undertaking. On the day of Varma’s hike, the temperature in the inner canyon was over 100F.“People need to be acclimated. Heat can be a factor that a lot of folks – unless they’re from a hot environment – can be blindsided by,” Baird said.Varma is one of several people to die in a national park in recent months as extreme heat has gripped US states from California to Florida and affected nearly all of the nation’s 425 national parks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "A group of 15 crossbench MPs and senators has written to the federal environment minister calling on the Albanese government to end native forest logging, as pressure also grows within Labor for it to do so.All seven teal independents, including Monique Ryan and Allegra Spender, the Greens, MP Andrew Wilkie and influential crossbench senator David Pocock have all called on Tanya Plibersek to end native forest logging in New South Wales and Tasmania as part of upcoming environmental law reform.More than 40,000 hectares of nationally vital koala habitat marked for potential logging in NSWRead moreThe call follows Labor MP Josh Burns urging the government to “act to save our precious natural environment and native wildlife” ahead of the Victorian budget, which will end native forest logging from 2024.Labor’s Environment Action Network (Lean) is also pressing to end native forest logging and transition to 100% plantation timber, with 192 branches endorsing that call ahead of Labor’s national conference in August.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe crossbench letter, sent on Wednesday, argued that at the federal election millions of Australians voted to “lower our carbon emissions, care for our environment, and protect the futures of our children and grandchildren”.It noted that Victoria had become the “second Labor government after Western Australia to end native forest logging”.Last week, Plibersek told the lower house that Labor “believes that we need to protect more of what is precious, restore more of what is damaged and manage it better for the future”.While it is “important to have a forestry industry here in Australia” and Labor supports expanding plantation forestry, Plibersek noted native forests are “very important carbon sequestration providers, [and] they are very important habitat”.“So, we are determined to make sure, as we update the environment protection laws, that regional forest agreements come under new national environment standards.”The crossbench welcomed this commitment but said instead of “tinkering around the edges” the Albanese government should be “brave … by ending native forest logging nationally”. Ending the practice in NSW and Tasmania “will save as many additional carbon emissions as removing almost two million cars from the road each year”, the letter said.The crossbench acknowledged the “challenging” transition for workers and families involved in the logging industry, and called for an “orderly transition” to other opportunities in “responsible forest management, such as carbon offsetting, tourism, and bushfire protection”.Plibersek has said she will unveil Labor’s proposed reforms to the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act this year.Lean convener Felicity Wade said “with native forest logging driving extinctions, the industry in crisis, having over-cut for years and wildfires being fed by the disturbance logging creates, it’s time to recognise this is not a 21st-century industry.“Labor members across the country are joining with Lean in calling for a shift to a plantation-based industry creating high quality, sustainable value-added products.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Michael O’Connor, an official of the Construction Forestry Maritime Mining Energy Union representing timber workers, has warned against the cessation of the industry, saying it employs “thousands of workers” and is vital for the social fabric of many communities.Labor MP Brian Mitchell has said the government supports “a sustainable, well-managed native forestry sector, which supplies vital hardwoods and speciality timbers”."

        "text": "European countries must bridge the vast “planning gap” between their climate targets and action plans, according to a report.The national energy and climate plans (NECPs) that EU member states made in 2019 are outdated, lack key details and do not line up with long-term strategies, according to analysis from the environmental nonprofit organisation Clean Air Task Force. Only half of the states have submitted a fresh proposal two months after an EU deadline for draft plans passed in June.“Three decades is a very short period to plan, permit, and construct the power system that we need in 2050,” said Alejandra Muñoz Castañer from CATF, lead author of the report. Governments have a “one-time opportunity to really take their planning endeavours more seriously, which they haven’t done in the past”.The report calls on member states to use their action plans to support a wider range of clean technologies, send clearer signals to investors of where to put their money, and plan cross-border infrastructure like electricity pylons and hydrogen pipelines.It also calls for a greater focus on solving practical problems like training enough workers and making it easier to get permits for clean energy projects.A spokesperson for the European Commission said it was working closely with the member states to ensure timely submission of their plans, and will issue an assessment of them by the end of the year.The EU has promised to cut greenhouse gas pollution by at least 55% from 1990 levels by the end of the decade and hit net zero emissions by 2050. But a report from the European court of auditors in June found “little indication that actions to achieve 2030 climate and energy targets will be sufficient”.The commission has said that NECPs, which outline how governments will meet their energy and climate goals, are “crucial for mobilising the massive investment needed” for climate neutrality and energy security. The last round of plans were written shortly before the Covid-19 pandemic and the EU’s green-stringed recovery packages.Since then, Russia has invaded Ukraine, sending gas prices soaring and sparking a continental push to boost energy security, while the US has passed a landmark climate bill that has spurred a global race to support clean technologies.The EU has also overhauled its own climate goals. Since the last round of plans it has raised its 2030 targets for renewable energy from 32% to 42.5%, for energy efficiency improvement from 32.5% to 36%, and for carbon removal from land use from 225mtonnes to 310m tonnes.Setting ambitious targets is an important step, said Nicole Pavia, a clean energy analyst with CATF and co-author of the report, “but what we see countries, regions, member states and the EU as a whole struggle with is: How do we get from today to 2030?”Only a handful of countries met the EU deadline for the next round of NECPs at the end of June and as of mid-September just 15 of the 27 member states have submitted a draft.Among the laggards are Germany and France, the two biggest greenhouse gas polluters in Europe, as well as Poland, the fourth-biggest. Italy, Spain and the Netherlands have submitted updated plans, along with a dozen smaller polluters.Raphael Hanoteaux, a policy adviser at climate thinktank E3G, said the EU’s rapid push for increased renewables and reduced consumption of fossil gas mean that “timely submission of these plans is paramount”.Member states have also seen a shift in priorities at home. Germany, for instance, was ordered by its constitutional court in 2021 to update its climate law because of provisions that “irreversibly offload major emission reduction burdens on to periods after 2030”.In August, the German environment agency found that the country has closed 70-80% of the gap between its policies and targets, compared with what it was in 2021, but “additional measures are still needed” to clean up its transport, buildings and industry sectors.Germany’s last NECP “was more of a box ticking exercise,” said Charly Heberer, an adviser on EU climate policy at nonprofit Germanwatch. “We would hope that the next NECP has been thought of a bit more holistically.”In central and eastern Europe, meanwhile, the last round of NECPs was “poorly implemented” and not tied closely enough to EU funds that could have helped drive change, a report from the NGO Bankwatch found in June.The Clean Air Task Force report called on governments to “connect the dots” beyond 2030 to 2040 and 2050, and better track progress to get there. The EU has not yet set a target for its greenhouse gas pollution in 2040 but plans to do so before elections in May 2024.Its scientific advisory board said in a report in June that the EU should aim for reductions of 90-95% by 2040 relative to the levels at which they were in 1990."

        "text": "Almost a third of the globe’s coastal environments rely on kelp to reduce local pollution and sustain fisheries that provide billions of dollars in benefits, according to a new study.But the climate crisis, overfishing, invasions of voracious sea urchins and pollution are putting at risk the world’s kelp forests, threatening the economic benefits they provide and the huge array of species they support.The dead sea: Tasmania’s underwater forests disappearing in our lifetimeRead more“They are the forests of the sea,” said Dr Aaron Eger, the study’s lead author. “If we lose these kelp forests, then we lose the oceans as we know it across massive regions all over the globe.”About 740 million people around the world live within 50km (30 miles) of kelp-dominated marine environments, the study published in Nature Communications said.But the critical role kelp plays in absorbing nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon, and keeping coastal environments healthy had gone underappreciated and understudied, said Eger, a marine ecologist at the University of New South Wales.He led the study alongside 18 other researchers from 10 countries to examine how six common types of kelp provided so-called “services” that benefit societies.They calculated the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon dioxide being absorbed by kelp forests worldwide and monetary values for each – the first time a global assessment of the value of kelp forests has been attempted.The world’s kelp forests absorb excess nitrogen and phosphorus running in to oceans from the land, and were likely absorbing the equivalent of about 18m tonnes of CO2 every year.Kelp also offers the building blocks for fisheries of abalone, lobsters and reef fish. Every hectare of kelp forest provides habitat for an average of about 900kg of harvested fish and seafood annually, the study says.Eger said when nitrogen washed into oceans from activities on the land, such as farming and industry, this could promote the rapid growth of microscopic algae that, when it died, depleted the waters of oxygen.But the world’s kelp forests were absorbing vast amounts of nitrogen which, in turn, improved water quality and gave marine life habitats to live.“This is just a baseline study, so we expect the approximations will get more accurate as the field advances,” Eger said.“There were also many other services we didn’t assess, including tourism, educational and learning experiences, and kelp as a source of food, so we anticipate the actual value of kelp forests in the world to be higher.”In some areas, including northern Tasmania, Western Australia and northern California, losses of up to 95% of kelp have been recorded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Samanth Subramanian captures perfectly the vast scale and longevity of the effort needed to clean up Sellafield (The long read, 15 December). As Britain and other states with nuclear power industries grapple with how to go about an effective, safe and economical nuclear clean-up, it might be better to explain the challenges with less reliance on suggestions that in its early days the nuclear industry never thought about decommissioning (though the point has validity). Instead, we need more honesty about the fact that nuclear power inescapably generates large quantities of hazardous human-made waste, the worst of which will remain hazardous probably beyond Homo sapiens’ time on the planet.The industry’s solution to this is a network of deep disposal facilities. But none have yet been created, their cost is enormous and there is no certainty that they will perform the long-term task required of them. These are considerations that sadly receive little attention in current debates about the need for new nuclear-generation capacity.Coincidentally, you published a letter (14 December) suggesting that nuclear radiation is less dangerous than emissions from a wood-burning stove, a curious comparison to make. Wood-burning stoves are pollutants, no question, but they could never lead to a Windscale, Three Mile Island, Chornobyl or Fukushima. Nor will decommissioning them cost billions and take decades.Tom SmithChair, Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, 2017-20 In 1993, a government official told me that “it was sometimes right to do the wrong thing”. For reasons of political expediency, it was right to give political consent for the operation of the thermal oxide reprocessing plant (Thorp) at Sellafield. This huge facility, not mentioned in Samanth Subramanian’s fine long read, had been built over the previous decade to reprocess British and foreign, especially Japanese, spent nuclear fuels. Abandoning it would be too embarrassing for the many politicians and their parties that had backed it, expensive in terms of compensation for broken contracts, and damaging to Britain’s and the nuclear industry’s international reputation.It was wrong to proceed, as the government well knew, because the primary justification for its construction – supply of plutonium for fast breeder reactors (FBRs) – had been swept away by the abandonment of FBRs in the 1980s (none were built anywhere). Because returning Thorp’s separated plutonium and radwaste to Japan would be difficult and risky. Because decommissioning Thorp would become much more costly after its radioactive contamination. Because there was a known win-win solution, favoured by most utilities – store the spent fuel safely at Sellafield prior to its return to senders, avoiding the many troubles that lay ahead.Thorp operated fitfully until its closure in 2018. The 30 tonnes of plutonium that it separated remains at Sellafield – another waste to trouble generations to come. William Walker Edinburgh Anton van der Merwe makes the compelling point that lack of investment in nuclear power over the last 40 years has had a disastrous impact on carbon emissions and therefore has exacerbated the climate emergency (Letters, 14 December). However, in the same issue, the long read discusses plans for new nuclear without mentioning the huge beneficial impact that low-carbon nuclear will need to have if we are to avoid climate catastrophe. The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on 1.5C temperature rises published in 2018 presented mitigation scenarios in which nuclear generation would grow on average 2.5 times from today’s level by 2050. Without this, the chances of meeting climate targets are much reduced.Neil SmithSolihull, West Midlands Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

        "text": "Rachel Reeves has said she wants to be “Britain’s first green chancellor” ahead of a speech in which she will call on ministers to extend relief on energy bills and promise that Labour will reduce these in the longer term with a massive green power programme.Addressing the Fabian Society conference on Saturday, the shadow chancellor is to argue that investment in renewable energies, plus a huge programme to retrofit insulation to homes – part of Labour’s flagship £28bn-a-year investment in climate measures – could save households up to £1,400 off annual bills each year.Reeves, newly returned from Switzerland, where she and Keir Starmer attended the World Economic Forum annual gathering in Davos, will also criticise ministers over the planned cut to support for rising energy bills from April.In comments to the Guardian ahead of the speech, Reeves stressed the party’s commitment to renewable energy. “When I said I want to be Britain’s first green chancellor, I meant it. This is something that really matters to the Labour party,” she said.“I want the electorate to judge me by my actions on tackling climate change and boosting energy security. I know our plans will bring down family energy bills, boost energy security and curb our reliance on fossil fuels.”Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves fill a vacuum in Davos charm offensiveRead moreReeves is set to say Labour would maintain the support, financed by an expanded tax on energy companies’ profits. By backdating this to the start of 2022, this could raise up to £13bn, the party claims.“Millions of households are still looking at a 40% increase in their energy bills in April,” Reeves was to say. “In a week when temperatures fell below zero, I know many families and pensioners will be feeling the pressure particularly acutely.“And at the same time, energy companies continue to enjoy record profits. That cannot be right.”While the government is spending vast sums on its scheme to give every household £400 to set against rising energy bills – the so-called energy price guarantee will cost £25bn in just its first six months – Labour believes the scale of the cost of living crisis means the support should be extended.The party also believes the government is vulnerable more generally in not having better prepared the nation for a possible energy crisis, both through the provision of UK-based renewables and by making homes and businesses more energy-efficient.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "The climate activist Greta Thunberg has pulled out of an appearance at the Edinburgh book festival, accusing its lead sponsor of “greenwashing”.Thunberg was scheduled to speak at the 3,000-seat Playhouse theatre to discuss her appeal for climate action, It’s Not Too Late to Change the World, as part of a series of “climate positive” events at this year’s festival.Her decision came after Scotland’s investigative news site The Ferret claimed that festival sponsor Baillie Gifford had billions invested in firms that profit from fossil fuels.In a statement released through the festival, Thunberg said: “As a climate activist I cannot attend an event which receives sponsorship from Baillie Gifford, who invest heavily in the fossil fuel industry.“Greenwashing efforts by the fossil fuel industry, including sponsorship of cultural events, allow them to keep the social licence to continue operating. I cannot and do not want to be associated with events that accept this kind of sponsorship.”A spokesperson for Baillie Gifford denied the company was a significant fossil fuel investor.Organisers had hoped that Thunberg’s appearance, along with Booker prize winners and political leaders, would help reverse last year’s dramatic decline in ticket sales.Nick Barley, the festival’s director who is curating his last festival after 14 years in charge, said: “While I am disappointed that Greta will not be joining us on 13 August, I fully respect her decision. I share Greta’s view that in all areas of society the rate of progress is not enough.”He defended Baillie Gifford’s sponsorship, saying: “We strongly believe that Baillie Gifford are part of the solution to the climate emergency. They are early investors in progressive climate positive companies, providing funds to help them grow. While they acknowledge there is still work to do, we have seen them make rapid progress throughout our 19-year relationship”.Barley apologised to all those who had bought tickets for the event “and especially to the hundreds of young climate campaigners who we had invited to come along because of their hard work to change the system in Scotland”. He said all tickets would be refunded in full.In its own statement, Baillie Gifford said: “We are not a significant fossil fuel investor. Only 2% of our clients’ money is invested in companies with some business related to fossil fuels. This compares to the market average of 11%. Of those companies, some have already moved most of their business away from fossil fuels, and many are helping to drive the transition to clean energy.“We are investing on behalf of our clients to grow their savings and retirement funds. When we invest in companies on their behalf, we do so over long time periods – typically 10 years or more – so this has naturally led us away from traditional fossil fuel firms. Currently, 5% of our clients’ money is invested in companies whose sole purpose is to develop clean energy solutions.”"

        "text": "Ministers have been urged to “open their eyes” to the need to build a vast network of new electricity grids to allow countries to hit climate goals, the chief of the world’s energy watchdog has said.Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), has warned that the equivalent of the entire global electricity grid – 80m km of grid – needs to be added or refurbished by 2040 to hit climate targets and ensure reliable power supplies.Global investment in energy grids needs to double to more than $600bn (£492bn) a year by 2030 to hit national climate targets after “over a decade of stagnation at the global level”, the IEA said.Households in Great Britain at risk of losing winter energy help, charity warnsRead moreDemand for electricity is predicted to surge as many consumers switch to low-carbon alternatives to traditional products, such as heat pumps and electric vehicles. Companies in heavily polluting industries, including steelmakers, are also looking to electrification to help them decarbonise.The Inflation Reduction Act introduced by the US president, Joe Biden, has encouraged investors to back renewable projects in America, while Europe is attempting to respond. There are fears that these efforts could be hampered by poor connections between where power is generated and where consumers live, as well as a logjam in hooking up to national grids.Renewable energy developers have repeatedly complained about their struggles to gain connections for their projects to the grid and accused the government of lacking vision. In the UK, some projects face waits of up to 15 years, and National Grid is attempting to cut delays.The IEA said renewable projects offering at least 3,000 gigawatts of power were waiting for connections to their national grids – five times as much as the solar and wind capacity added globally in 2022.Birol told the Guardian: “Governments need to open their eyes – if we want clean electricity, we not only need clean electricity generation, but we need to build grids. It has been a blind spot of the clean energy transition programmes of governments.”There are also concerns over a decline in grid investment in “emerging and developing economies, excluding China”.The IEA warned that delays in grid investment and reforms would increase the reliance on gas, pushing up carbon emissions and putting a goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels “out of reach”. It said that the world’s electricity use needed to grow 20% faster in the next decade than it did in the previous one to hit stated goals.The agency said governments needed to support the expansion of supply chains and extra training to upgrade grids, and planning systems needed to be improved.It recommended better coordination between planners of grid upgrades and renewable projects, improved processes to engage with the public on planning, and the increased use of digital tools to counter intermittency, when renewable power supply does not match demand.In the UK, National Grid last year laid out plans for a £54bn upgrade of the electricity network to accommodate the growth in the offshore wind industry, the biggest investment since the 1960s. However, last month’s failed energy auction saw no new offshore windfarms secure contracts, prompting criticism of Rishi Sunak’s government.Birol last month warned that countries and companies planning to expand their fossil fuel production were taking “very unhealthy and unwise economic risks” as their investments may not be profitable.Oil prices have since risen sharply in the fallout from the Israel-Hamas conflict, to more than $90 a barrel. Birol said: “If we see a physical disruption of oil in the markets, as usual, we are there to comfort the markets.”"

National Grid data showed that 21.6GW of electricity was supplied by wind early in the evening, about 50% of the power needed across Britain at 6pm and 6.30pm.This is a time of day where demand is traditionally high, as people return from work or start to prepare evening meals.It is the second time in two weeks that the wind record has been broken in Britain, after a previous best was set on 30 December.The German energy giant Uniper, which owns the Nottinghamshire plant, said: “As requested by the government, Uniper is now looking at whether we can make the unit available to run under standard market arrangements until the September 2024 coal phase-out date.“We have prequalified the unit to take part in the capacity market T-1 auction for 2023/24 [an auction for back-up power]. This means further investment to extend the life of the unit. The power station is set to close at the end of September 2024.”A government spokesman said: “The UK has a secure and diverse energy system, and we remain confident in our security of supply.“Working closely with Ofgem, National Grid Gas and other key industry organisations, we continuously monitor our energy supply and ensure we are ready for a range of scenarios.“In line with our net zero target, the government is planning to phase out unabated coal-fired power generation by the end of 2024.” This article was amended on 12 January and 13 January 2023 to clarify in the text and headline that three of the four units at Ratcliffe-on-Soar were already due to remain open until 2024."

        "text": "Australia could swing from three years of above-average rainfall to one of the hottest, driest El Niño periods on record, as models show an increasing likelihood the climate driver may form in the Pacific in 2023.The latest climate models used by the Bureau of Meteorology – which will update its forecasts on Wednesday – indicate sea-surface temperatures may exceed El Niño thresholds in the key region of the equatorial Pacific by June.Scientists caution that models may be less accurate ahead of the “autumn predictability gap” in April – the time of year when the Pacific enters a reset mode, allowing small influences to have big effects. But they suggest that after three consecutive La Niña years, the ocean is primed for a switch.“The Pacific must be quite charged with heat ready to have an El Niño,” Cai Wenju, a senior CSIRO climate scientist, told Guardian Australia. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we had an El Niño by the end of the year.”Agus Santoso, a senior researcher at the University of New South Wales’s Climate Change Research Centre, agreed. “Definitely an El Niño is a prospect [for 2023]”, he said. “You could have a weak El Niño. A strong El Niño is a possibility but neutral conditions are also a possibility.”\nSign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads\nPeople living on the east coast of Australia will be glad to see the end of the La Niña, which sees strong easterly winds cause the build-up of warm waters north and east of the country, supporting the formation of rain clouds and storms.Australia notched three straight years of above-average national rainfall to the end of 2022. Extensive flooding in some regions of NSW and South Australia remain ongoing, and Indonesia has also been affected by flooding.In an El Niño the trade winds stall or even reverse, increasing the risk of severe heatwaves, droughts and fires.Australia’s record-breaking weather in 2022: a very wet and sometimes very hot yearRead moreThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which uses different thresholds than the BoM to determine La Niña and El Niño events, last month rated odds of an El Niño forming by August-October as a two-in-three chance.The current La Niña had been of “moderate” strength compared with the 2010-11 event and “is on the way towards decay” by autumn, Santoso said.One factor in favour of an end to the string of La Niñas is that there are no recorded instances of four in a row, he said. While a La Niña event can be followed by an El Niño, the reverse combination is more common.Both Santoso and Cai caution that having conditions tilting towards an El Niño does not guarantee one will develop.They point to 2014, when models indicated an El Niño was very possible but one failed to develop. However, the following summer of 2015-16 produced one of the strongest El Niños on record.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Five Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

For the fossil fuel industry it’s still business as usual | Bill HareRead moreShould an El Niño develop, 2023 could turn out to be one of the hottest years in history, building as it would on the background rise of greenhouse gases and global heating.“When the next El Niño comes, we are going to have much, much worse conditions in terms of heatwaves,” Cai said.A typical El Niño might add about 0.1C to global mean temperatures but he warned the next one might top that “because there’s so much heat in the equatorial Pacific”.The intensity and frequency of La Niña and El Niño were likely to increase in a hotter world, Santoso said. The processes that trigger such events were reinforced by the warming of the sea-surface temperatures, enhancing the coupling between atmosphere and ocean.“We don’t know whether [the next dry spell] is going to be a long one or not,” Santoso said."

        "text": "Wildlife and environmental TV programmes have “failed wholeheartedly” in the past to spark action on the climate, biodiversity loss and the growing human population, Chris Packham has told an audience of TV executives.The Springwatch presenter said that although recent series had “turned a corner”, programme-makers must “shout more loudly” to tell the truth about environmental crises and call out politicians’ lies.He said future generations may come to regard today’s leaders such as Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Jair Bolsonaro and Scott Morrison in a similar way as current generations see Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot, because they could by then have caused the deaths of millions of people.“If we let them, they have the capacity to become genocidal maniacs because of their inactions, because of their actions when it comes to caring for our planet,” he said in the annual Bafta television lecture at the Barbican in London on Tuesday evening.Packham, whose Horizon documentary 7.7 Billion People and Counting was broadcast on BBC Two on Tuesday night, read the audience a short story he had written, set in a future where starving people queue to look at the last tree on the planet. He said science fiction might become science fact given the rising population, the “terrifying” collapse in biodiversity and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s warning that runaway global heating must be tackled within 10 years.In a video segment filmed in Tanzania, Packham said he was often told while making wildlife documentaries that it was not his job to make statements of environmental fact, “because that’s news, that’s something that’s got to be reported by journalists”. He said the recent UK general election had been marked by many journalists’ failure to challenge lies.“If someone tells you it’s sunny and someone else tells you it’s raining, you don’t quote them both, you look out of the bloody window and see whether it’s sunny or raining and then you tell the truth about it,” he said.“At this point in time, when it comes to environmental journalism, it is dangerous to lie because we have to tell the truth. Truth is the most essential component of progress.”Packham added: “For most of the last 30 or 40 years we’ve been making bits of the world look like paradise, absolute utopias. We go to places, there are never any people there, everything is functional, everything is beautiful. OK, we’ve excited people, we’ve fascinated people, we’ve shown them things they could never, ever have dreamed of, and they have fallen in love with that environment through awe and wonder and affinity – but has their love actually transformed into making a real difference? No.”Packham praised Blue Planet II for bringing plastic pollution to global attention and the One Show’s campaign to raise awareness on the same issue. The BBC’s Seven Worlds, One Planet contained some “hard-hitting stuff”, he said.“We are starting to make these programmes and the BBC has a real commitment to make more,” he told the Guardian before the speech, describing his Horizon documentary as “like a smack in the face with a sledgehammer”.“It’s going to hurt a lot,” he said. “It’s pretty hardcore. It’s the hardest programme the BBC have done yet.”Packham said Bafta’s We are Albert campaign, which encourages the film and TV industries to reduce their environmental impact, was a step in the right direction but he urged programme-makers to set meaningful targets to become carbon neutral within three years.He described recent environmental TV productions that used single-use plastic, where crew members flew home for weekends and where two camera operators flew to a location in a private jet. Such practices were “an open door for enormous and justified criticism”, he said.He told the audience: “You’re going to say it’s going to come with a cost, budgets are getting smaller. They are not getting as small as the wildlife populations out here in the world … you can’t have your cake and eat it too. It’s that simple.”"

        "text": "A study shows that the impact of air pollution on GP and A&E workloads may be greater than previously thought. Put another way, improving air quality could ease pressure on the NHS.Researchers compared the timing of 114,930 GP and 9,878 A&E respiratory visits in Bradford with air pollution measured around the city. Polluted days were followed by increased health service use for breathing problems, with impacts persisting for more than 100 days.A third of GP and half of A&E respiratory visits were attributed to nitrogen dioxide that was above World Health Organization (WHO) daily guidelines. This pollutant mainly comes from diesel vehicles and was estimated to cost the NHS in Bradford about £1.95m over the four-year study. There is also the hidden cost of time away from work and lost education, as well as the way that illness affects people’s lives.Separate research in south London between 2009 and 2013 also found increases in GP visits and inhaler prescriptions in the days immediately after pollution peaks.Prof Rosie McEachan, the director of the NHS Born in Bradford research programme and co-author of the new study, said: “There is no safe level of air pollution. We need more ambitious city-wide policies: clean air or low-emission zones, greater regulation of industrial pollution, cheaper and more reliable public transport, and infrastructure to enable people to use greener ways to get around.”The size of the air pollution impact may be related to underlying health problems in the area. Long-term respiratory illness in Bradford is greater than the national average. Even before the cost-of-living crisis, 15% of homes were living in fuel poverty and 22% of children were below the poverty line.A separate study of more than 300,000 people across the UK found that people on lower incomes were more vulnerable to breathing problems from air pollution.McEachan added: “Like other deprived cities in the UK, Bradford has high levels of respiratory illness. This is likely due to air pollution as many deprived urban areas are also pollution hotspots. High pollution events make these problems worse, with clear impacts on health service use.”The UK government’s air quality information service would classify most of these pollution events as low.McEachan commented: “UK air quality information systems should reflect the more stringent levels recently endorsed by the WHO. It is really important that the public understand the impact that dirty air has on their health.”New research from ISGlobal, the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, has quantified the impacts from different pollution sources to help local and national politicians to prioritise action. For Bradford nearly half the attributable deaths from nitrogen dioxide in 2015 were linked to traffic. Agriculture in the surrounding area is the top source for health impacts from particle pollution, but reducing pollution from transport, home heating and energy generation will help, too.Prof Mark Nieuwenhuijsen of ISGlobal said: “In this day and age, no one should die of air pollution in Europe. Bolder measures are required to drastically reduce pollution and deaths associated with traffic. At the same time, we need to tackle other sources including industry and shipping, along with limiting home wood burning and emissions from farming.”"

At least 10 humpback whales have died in east coast waters in 2023, six near New York and New Jersey, CBS reported.Noaa Fisheries is investigating the cause of such “unusual mortality events”, data for which has been collected since 2016.Conservatives and some conservationist activists attribute the rise in deaths to increasing offshore wind projects, calling on federal authorities to do more to protect the coastline.But federal officials have pushed back against claims that wind turbines are to blame, saying evidence does not support the contention wind energy projects cause whale fatalities.Noaa Fisheries said: “[T]here is no evidence to support speculation that noise resulting from wind development-related site characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of whales, and no specific links between recent large whale mortalities and currently ongoing surveys.”Local whale recovery and animal welfare organizations have faced threats, over accusations that they are “hiding” wind turbine-caused deaths, Time reported.Sheila Dean, 75, from the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in New Jersey, said one resident accused the center of covering up whale deaths.“He just starts [yelling], ‘I want to know, I demand to know,’” Dean said. “He was very frightening.”Humpback whale strandings have been increasing for seven years. Of 178 east coast whale deaths scientists examined, 40% were caused by ships or whales becoming entangled in fishing gear.Under the Biden administration, offshore wind projects have been initiated off New Jersey in an effort to create 30 gigawatts of energy by 2030, CBS reported.At least 12 New Jersey mayors have written to their state congressional delegation, calling for a pause on offshore wind activities until “further investigation is held by federal and state agencies that determine these activities are not a contributing factor to recent whale deaths”.A rally to demand that the New Jersey governor, Phil Murphy, pause all wind turbine projects will be held by an activist group, Protect Our Coast NJ, on Sunday."

        "text": "I have covered the Amazon as a journalist for almost 25 years. It started in 1998, with a trip along the Trans-Amazonian Highway. In 2017, I moved to the city of Altamira in Pará, northern Brazil; it is the centre of the deforestation, forest fires and social devastation caused by the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam. I moved here because I no longer wanted to be just a “special correspondent to the Amazon”, but so I could describe what was happening to the largest tropical forest on the planet from the inside. Despite this long experience, 2022 was the first year in which I watched the forest burn from the window of my home. I didn’t need to go to the fire, as journalists normally do. The fire had come to me.The photo I’ve chosen, taken by my husband, is from the night of 27 August. Later, Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research revealed that it was the worst August for fires in the Amazon since 2010. Fires and deforestation rose considerably under Jair Bolsonaro who, this year, was narrowly defeated in the presidential election by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, or Lula, as he is better known.Watching the forest burn from my window is, for me, like some kind of anti-metaphor. When Greta Thunberg said: “Our house is on fire!”, in the Amazon the image is literal. It already feels like a cliche to say we don’t need to read scientific reports to understand the climate crisis, we just have to open our windows. International agencies list Brazil among the countries with the highest number of murders of environmental defenders, or of people killed in “conflicts” over land. For me, it is more than a statistic. I know people who have died, I have suffered with their families. And I reject the word “conflict”. “Massacre” would be more appropriate.The lack of difference between the metaphor and the literal demonstrates the need for an urgency that has unfortunately been lacking at climate summits and other global events. This is why calls for the UN’s Cop summit to be held in the Amazon, on the forest floor, make complete sense. It is vital that negotiations advance at the speed the climate catastrophe demands. Knowing – from books, newspapers or scientific reports – is not the same as living. I know that, on a planet in a state of climate collapse, the real centres of the world are where life is found – not where the markets are.In the global climate negotiations, however, the markets still speak louder than the people who remain among nature. If we have any respect for future generations, it is time for the markets to be silenced and for nature to be heard. We will not escape the abyss that “we have dug with our own feet” (as the Brazilian singer Cartola put it) with the same thinking that has brought us to that abyss. It is obvious, but the obvious has so far been ignored.What my image here doesn’t communicate on its own is the pain. The forest is not an object and it is not only the trees that burn. The forest is a composition of living beings that exist in a constant state of exchange, in noisy conversation. Every time a tree dies, a world of non-human people burn along with her. I watched that fire and knew that no one would do anything for those who at that moment were suffering excruciating pain before their deaths. And the day after, there was silence. Silence, because this is the sound of the forest in death. This strengthens my conviction that in the 21st century, democracy will only make sense if it also includes the non-human species, from termites to primates, from fungi to corals.Capitalism, invented as we know and understand it in the country of the Guardian, has corroded the survival instinct of most of humanity. We must recover it. If, in the coming year, urgency is not met with urgency, you can be sure that my photo of 2022 will be yours one day soon.\nEliane Brum is one of the creators of the trilingual news platform Sumaúma and the author of Banzeiro Òkòtó: the Amazon as the Centre of the World, which is published in the UK in 2023.

        "text": "Air, water, soil, food and even blood – microplastics have found their way virtually everywhere on Earth, and now that list includes clouds.Bits of plastic particles were recently discovered above eastern China, with new research showing that these microplastics could influence cloud formation and the weather.‘We can’t carry on’: the godfather of microplastics on how to stop themRead moreA group of scientists from Shandong University in China collected cloud water atop Mount Tai, finding microplastics in 24 out of 28 samples. They include polyethylene terephthalate (otherwise known as PET), polypropylene, polyethylene and polystyrene, all particles commonly found in synthetic fibers, clothing and textiles, as well as packaging and face masks.“This finding provides significant evidence of the presence of abundant MP’s [microplastics] in clouds,” the researchers stated in the paper published today in Environmental Science and Technology Letters.Earlier this year, a study out of Japan showed that microplastics were present at the peak of Mount Fuji and Mount Oyama, suggesting that the particles may have originated from plastics in the ocean and been transported via air masses. The concentration of microplastics in Mount Tai cloud water was up to 70 times that of Japan’s mountains’ cloud water.“Most pollution we tend to think of is in liquid form,” said Fay Couceiro, a professor of environmental pollution at the University of Portsmouth. “We tend to think of that going into the river and the sea. Whereas microplastics, because they are a physical particle, are not following the normal rules. We’re finding microplastics in these pristine environments at the tops of these extremely hard-to-reach mountains.”So, how are they getting there?Other than contamination from people visiting these sites, the particles may be transported through the air. Samples from low-altitude and denser clouds had larger amounts of microplastics in them.Aged plastics – in other words, ones that have already been weathered from ultraviolet radiation – were smaller in size and had rougher surfaces. They also contained more lead, mercury and oxygen compared to pristine, untouched plastics. Scientists found that clouds can modify microplastics, possibly resulting in these particles affecting cloud formation.“Cloud formation has a huge implication for not just our local weather patterns, but for our global temperatures,” said Couceiro, who was not involved in the study.Clouds affect the climate in a plethora of ways. They produce precipitation and snow, affecting global rainfall and vegetation. Clouds block sunlight, cooling the surface of the planet and providing shade on the ground. But they can also trap heat and humidity, subsequently warming the air.The study authors state that more research is needed to fully determine the impact of microplastics on the weather, but what remains clear is that more can be done to address this.“There’s only one group of animals on this planet that use plastic, and that’s us human beings,” said Couceiro. “We really need a global response to this, as it’s not going to be solved by a single country, because air doesn’t respect boundaries.”"

        "text": "The number of tigers spotted by hidden cameras in the core of Thailand’s biggest conservation area rose last year, while a rare sighting of a mother and her cubs has spread hope that the species is breeding in new areas.Camera traps in Thungyai-Huai Kha Khaeng wildlife sanctuaries captured 120 tigers during an exercise that concluded in April 2023, up from 100 the previous year.Somphot Duangchantrasiri, the head of Khao Nang Ram wildlife research station at the Department of National Parks, said the increase was a promising sign. “It shows we are going in the right direction but still we are alert, and still watching the situation,” he said. “If we stop what we are doing then the number could go down.”In 2007, only 46 tigers were spotted in Thungyai-Huai Kha Khaeng wildlife sanctuaries, he said. Conservation work had taken years, he added: “Now we are starting to see the results.”He attributed the growth in numbers to stronger patrolling to stop poaching, as well as efforts to recover the numbers of animals that tigers hunt as prey, such as sambar deer.Thailand’s tiger population was thought to be between 148 and 189 in 2022. Most of country’s tigers live in Thungyai-Huai Kha Khaeng wildlife sanctuaries, the core area of the country’s Western Forest Complex. However, there are signs that tiger populations elsewhere may be recovering, too.In December, the Department of National Parks released images from camera traps at Salak Phra wildlife sanctuary, in the south-east of the Western Forest Complex, showing a mother and her two cubs – the first time cubs have been spotted on camera in the area. Identification work by Panthera Thailand later found there were three cubs.“This is a big news for us,” said Rattapan Pattanarangsan, the conservation programme manager at the NGO Panthera Thailand. Previously the location had attracted tigers that had been born in the core area of the forest and moved outwards, he said. “But now we are the source, we can produce tigers from our place. That means our place is safe enough, and has enough prey for the mothers to eat and breed.”In 10 years of monitoring, conservationists had not detected cubs born in the area, according to Panthera Thailand, which estimated the animals were about eight months old.According to the WWF, the global wild tiger populations may have reached 100,000 at the beginning of the 20th century. The numbers have plummeted as their range has been cut by 95% due to poaching and habitat destruction.In 2010, when the global population was estimated to be 3,200, 13 tiger-range countries, including Thailand, pledged to double the number of tigers by 2022.Progress has been mixed, and there are now an estimated 5,574, according to the Global Tiger Forum. India and Nepal have doubled their tiger populations, and numbers remain stable and increasing in Bangladesh and Bhutan respectively. Russia’s population has increased, while China is also restoring numbers in some pockets, according to the forum.Thailand is one of the few countries in south-east Asia to make progress in rebuilding its tiger population. The animal is at risk of extinction in neighbouring Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.Rattapan said since anti-poaching work had been increased – including through the installation of poacher cameras, which in areas with phone signal can alert ranchers to poachers by sending a text message – this posed far less of a direct threat to tigers.Conservationists say reductions in other human activities, such as livestock raising, commercial bamboo collection and the hunting of tiger prey, have also enabled numbers to recover in Salak Phra wildlife sanctuary.However, threats to tigers remain, including from human encroachment and forest fires. The climate crisis was also a concern, though its impact was difficult to measure, Rattapan said."

        "text": "Scientists have solved the mystery of why tens of thousands of octopuses cluster on the foothills of a giant underwater mountain, two miles down off the coast of California. The pearl octopuses, so named because from a distance they look like scattered gems, seek out warm water seeping through the seabed and use it to speed up the hatching of their eggs.This was the initial hunch scientists had when they discovered the “octopus garden” near Davidson Seamount in 2018, the second of four known deep-sea octopus aggregations.Instead of this horde of octopuses, they turned into a bunch of individualsDr Jim BarryReturning more than a dozen times with a remotely operated deep-diving robot, a team led by researchers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) gathered evidence that backs up this theory and provides astonishing new insights into life in the deep.The mauve, grapefruit-sized female octopuses each lay about 60 eggs and cement them to the bare rock, then guard them until they hatch. Temperature probes showed the water bathing the eggs ranged from 5C to 10C (40-50F), while less than a metre away it dropped to a frigid 1.6C.Revisiting individual nests, the team saw that rather than taking a decade or longer to hatch, as would happen in the very cold deep sea, baby octopuses emerge from their cosy nests after less than two years, dramatically boosting their chances of survival.A remotely controlled submersible filmed female pearl octopuses guarding their eggs in a warm-water vent two miles down and showed how they support other creatures such as anemones.   Photograph: MBARIThe warm water comes from hydrothermal springs, which are not as scorching as hydrothermal vents, also known as black smokers. “It never gets super-hot [enough] to cook the eggs of an octopus,” says Dr Jim Barry, from MBARI, who led the study.Based on photographs covering a small portion of the site, Barry and colleagues estimate the entire 333-hectare (823-acre) garden contains more than 20,000 octopuses, the largest aggregation scientists have found.Time-lapse cameras left among the nests tracked the molluscs’ comings and goings. “Instead of this horde of octopuses, they turned into a bunch of individuals,” says Barry.Q&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world’s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth – and how much there is to protect. Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.All through the year, new adult females and males arrived. They were never seen feeding and were never joined by smaller octopuses, indicating that the site is used exclusively for mating and nesting.As with most octopuses, male pearl octopus die shortly after mating, while females try to hang on until their eggs hatch. Barry describes seeing sea anemones chewing on octopus carcasses.Discovered in the deep: the squid that sees both ways at onceRead moreThese and other scavengers – including fish, shrimp, sea stars and snails – form a thriving ecosystem sustained by the dead octopuses. A short way off, in similar areas of rocky seabed, animal life is far less dense.Mysteries remain, including how far the octopuses migrate to the nest sites and whether, like salmon, they return to the spot where they were born. Octopuses have a good sense of smell and may follow the scent plume drifting from so many of their dead relatives.Barry expects there are more deep-sea octopus nurseries to discover. But while this octopus garden is protected within the Monterey Bay national marine sanctuary, other sites may be vulnerable to trawling and deep-sea mining.“It’s important that we consider the value of these little spots, and not indiscriminately wipe out areas of seabed,” he says."

The waste is now stored at Lucas Heights outside Sydney, and more than 100 institutions across the country.“Given the sensitivity of the project and the need for certainty of tenure that provides exclusive use of the site for the duration of the project, there appears to be no practical alternative to the extinguishment of native title,” the submission said.But the government would need to provide “benefits” in return, and be prepared for legal challenges. The submission also suggested a media strategy, saying that ruling out having intermediate waste (leaving just low-level waste) would “deprive the SA government of the argument the national repository was the thin end of the wedge, and that the government has a hidden agenda to site the national intermediate waste store in the state”.The current government plan is to use the Napandee site as permanent storage for low-level waste, and temporary storage for intermediate-level waste (the long-term plan for the intermediate waste is not clear).skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "The Baltic Sea faces “critical challenges” due to the climate crisis and degradation of biodiversity, a report has said, as Sweden’s coastguard battled to contain the impact of an oil spill off the country’s southern shore.In the most comprehensive audit of its kind to date, experts at the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission (Helcom) said on Tuesday there had been “little to no improvement” in the health of the body of water between 2016 and 2021.Fish stocks were at dangerously low levels, while pollution, land use and resource extraction continued to put pressure on the sea, the report said.Swedish authorities battle to stabilise stricken ferry leaking oil into Baltic SeaRead moreOn Monday the Swedish coastguard extracted about 20 cubic metres of oil from the Baltic, bringing the total to about 50 cubic metres, after a ferry ran aground three times off Hörvik in southern Sweden.The coastguard said on Tuesday it hoped the Marco Polo would be salvaged on Wednesday and taken to a port in Karlshamn to prevent a risk of further oil spills.Surrounded by nine countries including Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Russia, the Baltic’s relatively shallow, low-saline, brackish enclosed water makes it a unique marine environment. These properties also mean it is especially vulnerable to pollution and changing environmental conditions.The State of the Baltic Sea 2023 report found that despite efforts to improve its environment, overall conditions had not improved while some indicators had worsened.Jannica Haldin, the deputy executive secretary of Helcom and coordinator of the report, said: “The findings serve as a sobering reminder that the Baltic Sea faces critical challenges stemming from human activities. The importance of transboundary cooperation, a shift towards genuinely environmentally sustainable practices and long-term commitment cannot be overstated.”Human activities including pollution, overfishing and habitat destruction had affected the ecosystem, leading to an overall decline in biodiversity, the report found.Eutrophication – a largely human-made phenomenon in which excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus cause algae blooms – was also a problem, it said.The Baltic’s poor environmental status was also affecting the profitability of fisheries and tourism, the report found.There were some bright spots. Reductions in nutrient inputs and hazardous substances, as well as work on biodiversity and conservation, were found to have shown signs of success in some parts of the Baltic and several former pollution hotspots were removed from the latest assessment. The share of marine protected areas in the region was found to be increasing.But the climate crisis was increasingly taking its toll, the report said, resulting in reduced ice cover, more extreme weather and rising water temperatures.A Baltic Sea action plan, devised by Helcom in 2021, calls for strengthened biodiversity, a reduction in environmental pressures and an improvement in the overall health of the Baltic’s ecosystem.“Still, the current assessment results suggest that the recovery rate for biodiversity today is too slow,” Haldin said. “The deteriorated status presented in this report is directly linked to the activities and priorities of us as a society.”She added: “Ensuring that the Baltic Sea ecosystem maintains and improves its function is entirely dependent on how well we can manage our activities to ensure that they are truly sustainable and enhance the resilience of the ecosystem, both in the near future and long term.”"

Now I’d rather get arrested protesting them | Abigail DisneyRead moreThe meeting came during a summer that has put the climate crisis on full display. Deadly floods have struck New England. Canadian wildfire smoke has choked US cities. And tens of millions of people have been placed under heat advisories, with areas across the US south and west breaking temperature records.“We are seeing unprecedented changes all over the world,” Schmidt said.Though the changes may feel shocking, they are “not a surprise” to scientists, he added. “There has been a decade-on-decade increase in temperatures throughout the last four decades.”Earth saw its hottest June on record, according to Nasa’s global temperature analysis, the agency announced last week.All this heat, Schmidt said, is “certainly increasing the chances” that 2023 will be the hottest year on record. While his calculations show Earth has a 50% chance of setting that record this year, other models say there is as much as an 80% chance, he said.Scientists anticipate that 2024 will be even hotter than 2023, as an El Niño weather pattern – known for a tendency to boost global temperatures – will likely peak toward the end of this year.The last major El Niño, from 2014 to 2016, led to each of those years successively breaking the global temperature record, and 2016 is currently the Earth’s hottest year ever recorded, Schmidt said.Experts at the meeting raised the alarm about the changes Earth is experiencing and said they are directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions, though they stopped short of naming the source of the majority of those emissions: fossil fuels.“What we know from science is that human activity and principally greenhouse gas emissions are unavoidably causing the warming that we’re seeing on our planet,” said Calvin. “This is impacting people and ecosystems around the world.”The agency leaders touted its many climate-focused initiatives, which they said can help governments better mitigate the climate crisis and also prepare for its effects.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

An in-person exhibit in the agency’s headquarters opened to the public last week, and next week an online version will launch on Nasa’s website, Nelson said.Leaders detailed an array of other projects tracking environmental changes, including ones that track air pollution, methane emissions, and tropical cyclones and hurricanes. And they said the agency is aiming to help curb planet-warming pollution as well, for instance by researching lower-carbon forms of air travel.Some rightwing lawmakers are attempting to curtail funding to climate-related projects, including some of Nasa’s.Nasa’s earth science division director Karen St Germain said the agency does not merely want to accelerate scientific discovery. It also wants to make sure new research boosts climate preparedness, “ranging from a farmer assessing what to do with a single field, to global leaders weighing decisions impacting the entire world”.“Our goal is to put scientific information and understanding out in ways that help the public,” she said."

        "text": "The Liberal Democrats and green groups have accused the government of “an environmental crime” after it emerged that potentially large-scale oil drilling is to take place inside the South Downs national park, despite widespread local opposition.In a statement, UK Oil and Gas, which is part of the consortium wishing to drill at the Avington site near Winchester, said work was to resume in the hope of extracting “potentially significant” amounts of the estimated 59m barrels there, lasting up to 2025.Drilling had taken place previously at the site, but was shut down in 2017, with the South Downs park authority subsequently refusing permission for it to resume.However, this was reversed on appeal by the Planning Inspectorate, an agency of the Levelling Up Department, meaning the oil extraction can resume. The plan is also opposed by Winchester council, and by the local Conservative MP, Steve Brine.UK Oil and Gas is also involved in a separate scheme to drill for oil and gas near an area of outstanding natural beauty in the Surrey Hills, which is likely to go ahead after campaigners lost a judicial review.Jeremy Hunt had previously expressed opposition to drilling at the Surrey Hills site, but as chancellor in Rishi Sunak’s government, which has pledged to “max out” UK fossil fuel reserves despite warnings from scientists and green groups, now declines to comment.The Lib Dems are hopeful of using local opposition to such schemes as part of efforts to unseat MPs in Surrey, and are heavily targeting Brine’s constituency, held by the Conservatives in 2019 by less than 1,000 votes.Ed Davey (right) speaking to Paul Follows, a prospective Lib Dem candidate, at the planned drilling site in Dunsfold, in the Surrey Hills. Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesEd Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said: “Selling off national park land to rich oil barons is an environmental crime and must be stopped. Yet this Conservative government is making a habit of it. The government risks destroying wildlife habitat and ruining a popular walking route just to let this firm make a quick buck.“It is scandalous that Conservative ministers have ignored the concerns of local people and environmental impacts when making this decision.”Greenpeace UK’s policy director, Doug Parr, said: “This government is so hell-bent on fossil fuels that it’s now willing to trash many of the things it is said to hold dear, like our cherished national parks and community consent.“Despite being the cheapest, cleanest energy source there is, onshore renewable projects are blocked if so much as one person objects. It beggars belief then that the government can overrule the very sensible decision of a council to reject an application for more oil drilling in a national beauty spot, during a climate crisis.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A program in New York offered tenants the chance to do just that and found striking differences in the levels of harmful indoor chemicals after the switch. ‘I use it because it’s better’: why chefs are embracing the electric stoveRead moreThe pilot program took place in a 96-unit public housing building outfitted with gas stoves in the Bronx. Twenty low-income households participated, and at the beginning of the study half were given induction stoves, which use electricity to heat the cookware directly and don’t emit pollutants.Researchers performed a controlled cooking test and found that the baseline level of nitrogen oxide (NO2) – which forms in the air from burning fossil fuels – in homes with gas stoves was 18 parts per billion (ppb).It rose to an average of 197ppb during cooking. That is almost twice the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) threshold for outdoor exposure deemed unhealthy for sensitive groups, such as people with respiratory illnesses, seniors and young children. Long-term exposure to NO2 can exacerbate asthma, lung disease and increase the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.(The EPA does not have standards for indoor air pollution, even though Americans on average spend 90% of their time indoors.)In the homes with induction stoves, by comparison, the background NO2 level of 11ppb saw a negligible change to 14ppb during cooking.Bronx resident Maria Leger with an induction stove. Photograph: We Act for Environmental JusticeOn average, households with gas stoves were exposed to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations 190% higher than those with induction stoves when cooking a meal. Over 10 months of air quality monitoring, households with induction stoves experienced a 35% drop in daily NO2 concentrations in their apartments.“One of our participants who has asthma said that when she would turn on the gas stove she would always start coughing,” said Annie Carforo, a climate justice campaigns coordinator at We Act for Environmental Justice, a New York City advocacy group that spearheaded the pilot with Columbia University and Berkeley Air Monitoring Group. “And she noticed that now with the induction stove, that doesn’t happen. Her assumption is that it was the gas that was leading to that reaction and she does feel a sense of relief knowing when she turns her induction stove on she’s not breathing in air pollutants that are exacerbating her asthma.”In the focus group conducted by Columbia University researchers, all participants said that one of their greatest fears around gas stoves was their homes catching fire due to a gas leak, a stove malfunction, or the gas not being turned off properly. Participants overwhelmingly preferred cooking with induction stoves and at the end of the study no one asked to return to gas. The entire building is scheduled to be fully electrified by the New York City housing authority, which also partnered in the pilot program.“Intervention studies such as this one are important to determine the benefits of electrification, especially for people living in lower-income housing who are most at risk,” said Rob Jackson, a professor of earth system science at Stanford University, who was not involved in the New York program.A recent study he co-authored revealed that gas stoves are constantly emitting methane, even when turned off. “I’m not surprised to see higher NO2 measured in homes cooking over gas stoves compared with induction stoves. I’m also not surprised to see NO2 concentrations rise quickly above safe thresholds. Gas stoves pollute more than electric stoves, especially compared to newer induction technologies.”US renters have growing worries over gas stoves – and few optionsRead moreHouseholds buying a new induction stove can apply for credits and rebates available in the Inflation Reduction Act, but these incentives leave out low-income renters, who often do not have a choice over their appliances. A similar gas stove replacement study is in the works in multifamily housing units in Buffalo, New York, with data collection anticipated to begin this year.“We should always be using the cleanest energy we have access to,” said Darby Jack, an associate professor of environmental health at Columbia University and one of the authors of the report about the program. “For a long time, induction electric was really expensive and the cost of induction stoves has come way down.”"

        "text": "“Bears are made of the same dust as we, and breathe the same winds and drink of the same waters.” So wrote John Muir in his journal in 1871 after finding a dead bear in Yosemite – presumably Ursus arctos horribilis, a grizzly. If one considers the characteristics of the grizzly, this is quite a remarkable thing to write. We are not closely related to bears (their closest living relative is a seal), and grizzlies make for terrible company. And yet Muir was not alone in feeling that bears are somehow kin: we (or at least we in the west) tell stories about friendly bears; we fall asleep beside toys formed in their image; some have even tried to keep them as pets or live with them in the wild.This imagined kinship forms just one thread in Gloria Dickie’s book Eight Bears. It’s a family album of the remaining varieties of bear, but the book does more than its title suggests. Just like a good photography critic, Dickie is attuned to the person behind the camera: how we have framed bears over the centuries, enmeshing them in the stories that we tell about ourselves. As Dickie shows, bears are in deep trouble, and her book is a compelling attempt to see through their eyes: to explore what it means to be a bear in a warming world that is short on space.Spectacled, sloth, panda, moon, sun, American black, brown and polar bear: so wondrously varied are Dickie’s subjects in physical form, character, diet, range and habitat that it is sometimes hard to fathom that they all belong to the same family. Were you to invite them all to dinner you would need an impossibly varied menu (salmon, seal, insects, bromeliads, bamboo, honey) and impractical seating arrangements (a sun bear may weigh 60lb; a grizzly, 600lb). The sun and spectacled bears, shy tree dwellers, might retire early, while others, notably the sloth bear, might dominate proceedings (sloth bears are prone to aggressive behaviour, possibly due to their precarious position in the food chain, just below India’s leopards and tigers).Despite our fondness for bears, a vein of cruelty runs through human-ursid relations, and Dickie writes in painful detail about the ways in which we have turned them into entertainment or natural resources: Roman bloodbaths in which bears fought, sometimes reluctantly, against other wild animals or prisoners; bearbaiting, a popular pastime in medieval England, which was only banned by parliament in 1835; and bear “dancing”, a practice from which the Kalandar nomads of northern India historically made their living. In one chapter Dickie travels to Vietnam to learn about bear bile “harvesting”, a practice that resembles a form of torture; Asiatic black and sun bears are held in cages, their bile extracted from punctured gall bladders (it is used in traditional medicine in some Asian countries to reduce inflammation and lower cholesterol).Although hideous, the destruction wrought by such practices pales in comparison to that caused by habitat loss and climate change. According to Dickie, only three bears – American black, brown and panda – may survive into the next century. Theirs is a future not just characterised by loss, but by uncanny changes in behaviour and biology: Dickie writes of black bears that no longer hibernate, pandas that cannot survive in the wild and “pizzlies” (the offspring of polar bears and grizzlies).The book is full of brave scientists and conservationists, but their acts seem dwarfed by the scale of these problems – problems that challenge the nature of human heroism and the utility of storytelling itself. Towards the end of the book one Canadian polar bear expert tells Dickie that it is “vainglorious to study the natural history of polar bears” given “how much they are screwed up”; to pause to admire the fur or claws of a bear is akin to lingering on a severed artery. Yet, thankfully for her readers, Dickie does pause to capture the majesty of these creatures as they navigate our crowded and warming world. Even epitaphs can have their beauty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to BookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s.

The net effect of that is more sunlight gets reflected back to space.”The result was a phenomenon akin to what’s known as June gloom in the US, “where you have very cold ocean conditions but very warm atmospheric conditions above this cloud layer – that’s referred to as an inversion,” Fasullo said.“Winds carried these anomalous conditions into the deep tropics, and that instigated the feedbacks that are commonly associated with La Niña,” he said. “The winds became stronger as a consequence of the surface cooling off, and then the flow going into the tropics was also drier, because a cold surface means you have less humidity in the atmosphere.“Because of that, the whole band of precipitation that usually exists in the tropics move northwards, and that’s a critical component for getting a La Niña.”\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nEast-to-west equatorial trade winds strengthen in the Pacific during a La Niña, increasing the chances of above-average rainfall in the spring and summer over much of Australia and south-east Asia. It has the inverse effect in other regions, such as in the southern US where the chance of drought is increased.Cooler surface temperatures over the south-eastern Pacific persisted until 2022.La Nina graphic“We were surprised by how long the cooling lasted even with knowledge of these feedback loops,” Fasullo said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the recent [triple] La Niña … was preceded by weak El Niños in 2018 and 2019.”He added: “In 2020, the forecast for La Niña was not very reliable. It was not clear whether we were going to have a La Niña or not.”Incorporating wildfires into ENSO prediction systems could be beneficial, Santoso said, adding: “It seems like it is only when we have really strong bushfires that the mechanism can work.”Though the 2019-20 bushfires ejected smoke aerosols high into the stratosphere – the second layer in Earth’s atmosphere – the 2020 La Niña resulted from interactions between smoke and clouds in the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere, Fasullo said."

It is clear a stronger co-regulatory framework that brings in and aligns the entire packaging system and creates an even playing field for all will help to further reduce environmental impacts and deliver community and economic benefits.”The review outlined continuing challenges for industry, such as “cost, competitive risk, hard-to-recycle items, recycling capacity, limited access to high quality recycled content, inconsistent policy, poor data to support decision making and measure impact, and uncertainty about future outcomes”.Kate Noble, a plastics policy expert at WWF-Australia, said: “Industry self-regulation has proven to be a failed experiment.“Industry has said loud and clear they can’t deliver these targets without additional government intervention.

        "text": "For residents of Montpellier, the new year has brought new travel possibilities. Since just before Christmas, locals have been able to sign up for a free pass to the entire bus and tram network in France’s seventh‑largest city. The majority of a population of 300,000 have, not surprisingly, taken up the offer. Yet the city council is not presenting this as largesse on its part. Rather, says its head of transport, Julie Frêche, it is making the change “because mobility is a right”.Slowly but surely, the dial on public transport policy across Europe is shifting. The pandemic – and the apparently long-term change to working patterns it triggered – has played a part, as has the cost of living crisis. Prior to both, the environmental need to rely less on cars had already begun to chip away at longstanding assumptions about how we get around.In 2013, Tallinn, the Estonian capital, became the largest city in the world to introduce fare-free public transport, financed by the city’s resident tax. Luxembourg’s 640,000 citizens became entitled to the same in 2020. In France, the Observatory of Cities with Fare-Free Transport estimates that 43 towns and cities now offer at least some access without charge. In Germany and Austria, heavy public subsidies on tickets introduced during the cost of living crisis look as if they are here to stay in modified form.In England, the sense of transport as a public good was lost amid the late 20th-century drive to privatise the bus and train networks – subsidising operators rather than passengers along the way. But even here, change is in the air. Liverpool city region is set to emulate Greater Manchester in moving to take buses back under public control. Following a public consultation, West Yorkshire Combined Authority may follow suit. The widely adopted £2 bus fare cap scheme, in place in England until the end of this year, is further evidence of a changing zeitgeist. Removing it in 2025 would be a deeply unpopular political move.For larger European cities, which are generally more heavily dependent on ticket revenue, a move to totally fare-free services would be challenging in the short term. But for places like Montpellier, where fares generally finance a smaller proportion of the running costs of the transport network, it is both eminently doable and transformatory. In Dunkirk, where bus services have been funded by tax revenue since 2018, the result has been a boom in usage and perceived service quality, along with a widespread sense that the new system enhances the town’s image.Such experiments and innovations have a particular relevance in the context of Covid and the cost of living crisis. But they should not merely be seen as a policy option in hard times. Flourishing and accessible public transport systems are an essential feature of sustainable 21st-century living. They are a means of social inclusion and wellbeing, helping to generate a sense of place and collective belonging.They are also politically smart. Various studies have pointed out that moves to restrict car usage achieve more reliable results in cutting congestion, carbon emissions and pollution. But the politics of the green transition needs pull as well as push factors to ensure popular consent and change lifelong habits, while inculcating new ones in young people. Reconceiving public transport as a common good similar to health, education and other services can become part of the wider cultural reset that is the task of our times."

Either way, the levels will be very high.”The intense heat is expected to last for about two weeks in central and southern parts of Italy, while slightly subsiding in the north.Naming the anticyclone after Cerberus, the three-headed monster-dog that in Greek mythology guards the gates to the underworld, was not a coincidence, the meteorologist Stefano Rossi told La Stampa. Cerberus appears in Dante’s Inferno, where it guards the third circle of hell.“Metaphorically, the three heads indicate the three main climatic zones into which Italy will be divided,” Rossi said, adding that humidity levels would be “skyrocketing” and that nighttime temperatures would not drop below 22C.A heatwave is also sweeping across France, Germany, Spain and Poland.In Spain, where the second heatwave of the summer could bring temperatures of up to 44C to some southern parts of the country, the Red Cross has urged people to take extra care and to check on those most vulnerable to the high temperatures, such as children and older people.It is calling on people to remember to stay hydrated, to avoid caffeine and alcohol, and to watch for signs of heatstroke, which can include vomiting, confusion, hot, dry skin and fainting.Spain’s state meteorological office, Aemet, said temperatures on Monday could reach 38C across many parts of the Iberian peninsula, rising to 40C in southern areas and 44C in parts of the Guadalquivir valley.The heatwave, which is forecast to last until Wednesday, could bring temperatures of up to 43C to Mallorca and the Ebro valley on Tuesday.Searing temperatures were also expected to affect Greece where the Athens National Observatory forecast they would reach an average of between 42C and 43C as of Wednesday. The heatwave, the first this summer, is slated to peak on Friday, although forecasters predicted the extreme weather could trigger forest fires and be prolonged, “insidious and dangerous”.In a rare step, the country’s health, labour and citizens’ protection ministries issued emergency warnings on Monday calling on employers to ensure staff did not work outdoors between noon and 5pm and advising older and more vulnerable people to remain hydrated, eat lightly and stay indoors.The City of Athens announced it would open special air-conditioned spaces to host citizens, in operation between 8am and 8pm from Tuesday. The Greek capital’s large stray animal population will also be taken care of, with about 150 watering stations in place around the city. Greek scientists have taken the unprecedented step of naming and ranking heatwaves in a bid to better prepare policymakers and affected populations of the perils posed by the “invisible killers.”Heatwave last summer killed 61,000 people in Europe, research findsRead moreResearch has found there were 61,672 heat-related deaths last summer, the hottest ever recorded in Europe. The mortality rate was highest in Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal.In every week of summer 2022, the study found, average temperatures in Europe “uninterruptedly” exceeded the baseline values of the previous three decades. The most intense heat was between 18 and 24 July, when it killed 11,637 people.Human-caused climate change is making every heatwave in the world more intense and more likely to happen. According to a report by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, last year’s heatwaves in Europe would have been virtually impossible without global heating."

This time, the creature is a caterpillar, its pale green body blending with the grass – and it is setting one hell of a pace as it traverses the bare earth.Now, its colouring and extravagant white fluff stands out. Four buff tufts sprout from its back, and a pinky red tail of hairs reaching up from its rear like a flag. As it flexes, it flashes black. As it flexes, it flashes black. I resist the urge to put out my hand and invite this pale tussock moth larva to crawl over my skin. They can cause severe allergic reactions.Pickers of hops – one of the caterpillars’ food plants – used to call them “hop dogs”, and there is something curiously dog-like in the way they move, as if following a scent. And this one is on a mission. With autumn sinking softly around us, it needs a safe place to overwinter as a cocoon. In spring, it will emerge as a furry-legged, pale tussock moth.A pale tussock caterpillar looking for somewhere to pupate. Photograph: Kate BlincoeA nearby hum reminds me that I’m approaching the hornets’ nest in a hollow tree, cordoned off to save walkers from a fright. A constant stream of chestnut-coloured European hornets (Vespa crabro) whiz in and out of the hole – I’m surprised the nest is still so active.At this time of year it is dying, with the males, old queen and workers reaching the end of their lives. Females that will become new queens are filling up on nectar, ready to hibernate. Despite their large size, hornets are not as aggressive as wasps, but they would defend their nest site. Seeing one hornet is often a shock, and seeing several together really should instil respect.But I’m a fool. I’d like a photo for this article. I climb under the rope fence for a better view. Almost instantly, a hornet buzzes close to my ear. It’s loud. I take a hasty photo but it’s rubbish. Maybe if I go forward a bit? Maybe if I go forward a bit? I take one more step and a hornet bumps my shoulder, then flies back to the nest. It probably didn’t see me. But I am soon nudged again, this time on my cheek, and I can be in no doubt that I’m being politely but firmly warned. I take the hint and leave, with as much urgency as the caterpillar.‘A nearby hum reminds me that I’m approaching the hornet’s’ nest in a hollow tree, cordoned off to save walkers from a fright.’ Photograph: Kate Blincoe"

        "text": "Two of Europe’s most innovative pop singers, Björk and Rosalía, have collaborated on a new song to benefit activists fighting against industrial salmon farming in Björk’s native Iceland.The song’s title has not been announced, but it will be released later this month; a 75-second preview has been published online.In a statement accompanying the announcement, Björk wrote: “People at the fjord Seyðisfjörður have stood up and protested against fish farming starting there. We would like to donate sales of the song to help with their legal fees and hopefully it can be an exemplary case for others.”She heralded Iceland as “the biggest untouched nature in Europe and still today it has its sheep roaming free in the mountains; in the summers its fish have swum free in our lakes, rivers and fjords. So when Icelandic and Norwegian businessmen started buying fish farms in the majority of our fjords, it was a big shock and rose up as the main topic this summer. We don’t understand how they had been able to do this for a decade with almost no regulations stopping them.”Thousands of salmon escaped an Icelandic fish farm. The impact could be deadlyRead moreIn 2022, a merger worth £118m was completed between the two largest salmon fisheries in Iceland, with Ice Fish Farm acquiring Laxar Fiskeldi; a majority stake in the company is held by Norwegian company Måsøval. Ice Fish Farm controls the Seyðisfjörður fjord as well as three others in the east of the country, and aims to process 10m salmon each year.This industrial farming of salmon, Björk claims, “has already had a devastating effect on wildlife and the farmed fish are suffering in horrid health conditions. And since a lot of them have escaped, they have started changing the DNA in the Icelandic salmon for the worse, and could eventually lead to its extinction.”Ahead of the merger, Ice Fish Farm chief executive Guðmundur Gíslason said: “The long-term goal is to create a company that delivers high quality premium salmon with high efficiency and full respect to nature.” The Guardian has contacted Ice Fish Farm for a response to Björk’s criticisms.Björk concluded: “Our group would like to dare these businessmen to retract their farms! We would also like to help invent and set strict regulations into Iceland’s legal system to guard nature.” She claimed: “The majority of the nation already agrees with us so this protest is about putting the will of the people into our rule-systems.”Björk – her 20 greatest songs ranked!Read moreBjörk has long been a strident environmental activist. In 2008 she founded the Náttúra Foundation to support Iceland’s natural habitats and protest against aluminium factories being built there, and in 2015 campaigned against the construction of an energy project in the country’s highlands, calling for a national park to be created in its stead. She has celebrated the natural world in her music, and has supported activist Greta Thunberg, saying of her anthology The Climate Book in 2022: “I’m inspired and sad because the situation is worse even than we thought it was, but there are some hope-inspiring moments there, to encourage us to act.”The song marks her first collaboration with Spanish singer Rosalía, who has become a global star in recent years for her bold interpretation of various Latin music styles. She credited Björk as an inspiration after winning a Latin Grammy award in 2018, saying: “I want to thank women like Lauryn Hill … Björk, Kate Bush … shout out to all the women in the industry that have taught me that I could do this because thanks to them I am here.” Björk has expressed admiration in turn, telling Spanish newspaper El País that Rosalía had “activated” wider enthusiasm for Spanish-language music.Their collaboration is Björk’s first release since her 2022 album Fossora, which she recorded in her home country and described as an “Iceland album” for its engagement with folk traditions and nature."

If climate policies are accelerated to meet the goal of limiting global heating to within 1.5C of pre-industrialised levels then fossil fuel use would decline by more than 75% by 2050.Birol said rising public outrage against the fossil fuel industry was likely to grow as the link between extreme weather events and carbon emissions became better understood.“This is a very important development. The more we see these extreme weather events the harder it will be for the industry to justify a failure to act. Many claim that they want to be part of the fight against climate change but it’s time that they show this,” he said.Oil and gas companies spend about 2.5% of their capital on clean energy technologies such as renewables and electric vehicle charging, compared with 97.5% on traditional business areas, according to Birol.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The agency said about half of this was paid to governments, and 40% went back into investment, leaving about 10% to be returned to shareholders or used to pay down debt."

        "text": "The UK should “level up” its investment in green technologies to match the US and the EU, according to the chief executive of the FTSE 100 packaging company DS Smith.Speaking days before the chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s spring budget, Miles Roberts said the UK government needed to give a clear signal of its long-term plans, particularly for low-carbon power generation.The US is spending $369bn (£310bn) on subsidies for green technologies under the Inflation Reduction Act, while the EU has been scrambling to come up with a response after some companies warned that they were considering prioritising America for investment.“We need to make sure that the UK levels up to the US and Europe,” Roberts said, speaking at the company’s new head office in west London. “That is a formidable package of support. We’re saying to the UK government: ‘How do we make sure that we don’t fall behind?’”Uncertainty over the Conservatives’ plans for green power generation was making it more difficult for DS Smith to invest in new facilities in the UK, Roberts said. Packaging companies are recognised by the government as energy-intensive industries because they require large amounts of heat to reform recycled cardboard into new boxes. Demand for packaging has risen inexorably in recent years thanks in part to the boom in online deliveries.“Going forward, we have to decarbonise, but what are your plans? Where are they?” he said of the government’s energy policy. “We come to the UK and say: ‘Can we just understand what is your policy?’”Roberts also said the government should extend the “super deduction”, which is scheduled to end in April. The two-year tax break has allowed companies to offset 130% of investment spending on plant and machinery against profits.“What can we do in two years?” Roberts said. “If they said: ‘We’re going to do this over a 10-year period,’ and actually stick to their word, then these things would help.”The Labour party, which has a large lead over the Conservatives in the polls, has said it will consider similar long-term tax breaks. Roberts said Labour should offer detailed guidance on its policy plans to industry.Bloomberg reported on Saturday night that Hunt would announce a temporary “full-expensing” regime for corporation tax, to replace the super deduction. Full-expensing will let companies deduct the full cost of certain investments from their taxable profits in the year it was incurred, rather than spread over several years. The Treasury has estimated that it could cost £11bn a year.Rishi Sunak’s government has not so far signalled any intention to subsidise Britain’s green industry on a similar scale to the US or EU, although it is thought to be considering some large investments in decarbonisation, such as a request for £500m to support a battery “gigafactory”, and £300m apiece to upgrade the UK’s two steelworks with blast furnaces.However, the government on Thursday delayed one major infrastructure project, the HS2 rail line, because it wanted to spread the cost over a longer time period.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Currently, it says, Britain produces almost every component required to manufacture tomorrow’s zero-emission vehicles. But its capability to manufacturer components such as batteries, powertrains, fuel cells, power electronics, anodes, rare earth magnets, graphene and silicon carbide wafers must be “scaled up quickly”, the SMMT said.“Britain boasts a firm foundation of EV production, backed by low-carbon energy, outstanding R&D and a highly skilled and productive workforce. We must not squander these advantages,” said Mike Hawes, SMMT’s chief executive.“With other parts of the world turbocharging their support for the zero-emission vehicle transition, we need to step up to compete in this global race. Every part of the country has a stake in the switch, and with fast, decisive action, we can deliver for Britain the growth, jobs and green prosperity it deserves,” Hawes added."

        "text": "One of the world’s biggest scientific publishers has retracted a journal article that claimed to have found no evidence of a climate crisis.Springer Nature said it had retracted the article, by four Italian physicists, after an internal investigation found the conclusions were “not supported by available evidence or data provided by the authors”.Climate sceptic groups widely publicised the article, which appeared in the European Physical Journal Plus in January 2022 – a journal not known for publishing climate change science.Nine months later the article was reported uncritically in a page one story in the Australian newspaper and promoted in two segments on Sky News Australia – a channel that has been described as a global hub for climate science misinformation. The segments were viewed more than 500,000 times on YouTube.Sky and the Australian find ‘no evidence’ of a climate emergency – they weren’t looking hard enough | Temperature CheckRead moreThe article claimed to have analysed data to find no trend in rainfall extremes, floods, droughts and food productivity.“In conclusion on the basis of observational data, the climate crisis that, according to many sources, we are experiencing today, is not evident yet,” the article said.Several climate scientists told the Guardian and later the news agency AFP that the article had misrepresented some scientific articles, was “selective and biased” and had “cherrypicked” information.After those concerns were raised, Springer Nature announced in October it was investigating the article.In a statement Springer Nature said its editors had launched a “thorough investigation”, which included a post-publication review by subject matter experts.The authors of the article also submitted an addendum to their original work during the course of the investigation, the statement said.“After careful consideration and consultation with all parties involved, the editors and publishers concluded that they no longer had confidence in the results and conclusions of the article,” the journal said.“The addendum was not considered suitable for publication and retraction was the most appropriate course of action in order to maintain the validity of the scientific record.”A retraction note appearing on the article says concerns were raised “regarding the selection of the data, the analysis and the resulting conclusions of the article”.The note says the article’s conclusions “were not supported by available evidence or data provided by the authors”.“In light of these concerns and based on the outcome of the post publication review, the editors-in-chief no longer have confidence in the results and conclusions reported in this article,” the note adds.The article is still available for download, but the manuscript now has the words “RETRACTED ARTICLE” stamped over each page. According to the journal’s website, the article was accessed 92,000 times.The Guardian asked why the issues with the paper were not picked up before publication. Springer Nature said it could not discuss “the specific history or peer review process of a paper with anyone other than the authors”.The publisher and editors were “committed to maintaining the highest possible levels of integrity in the content published in the journal, and we are taking steps to ensure that similar issues do not occur in the future”.“For example, we are supporting our editors-in-chief in increasing oversight of editors and guest editors to ensure that our policies and best practice are adhered to,” a statement added.Alarm at exodus of climate voices on Twitter after Musk takeoverRead moreProf Steven Sherwood, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales who was among those critical of the article, said it was important the journal had allowed the authors to defend their work.“This shows the journal did not rush to judgment against the paper,” he said.“I commend the journal, both for giving this initial benefit of the doubt to the authors and for having the resolve to retract the paper when the authors could not justify their claims.”Two of the study’s four authors, retired nuclear physicist Renato Ricci and known climate science sceptic Franco Prodi, signed a declaration in early 2022 that there was “no climate emergency” and that “enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial”.The study’s lead author, nuclear physicist Prof Gianluca Alimonti, argued in 2014 that there was no consensus among climate scientists that global warming was caused by human activity. At least six separate studies have shown that between 90% and 100% of climate scientists agree warming is caused by humans.The Guardian emailed Alimonti for comment but did not receive a reply. The Australian newspaper and Sky News Australia were also approached for comment."

A seaside minibreak, wringing the last drops of summer from the year. A squabble of herring gulls argue over a chip. Crows loiter with intent to scavenge. A pied wagtail bounces overhead, lands on a patch of sandy grass, and struts its wind-up toy walk, on the lookout for scraps. British seasiders play fast and loose with the foodstuffs, and there are easy pickings to be had. So the chatty bush is no surprise.They are house sparrows, the ultimate LBJ (little brown job) and as enthusiastic a devourer of our leftovers as you’ll find. Thirty of them, give or take, babbling and chattering and falling over each other to say hello. Spadger, spug, squidgie, sparky, sprog – the wealth of folk names is a reflection of their former ubiquity.This encounter lifts the heart in strange and unfathomable ways. Back in the day they were so commonplace that 30 in a bush would barely have merited a glance. But times change, and now, on the comparatively rare occasions I do see them on my south London patch, I greet them with the exuberance reserved for old friends. The population decline has been sharp – up to 70% between 1977 and 2018, with signs of a slight increase since then. The usual reasons are suspected – habitat loss, lack of suitable food, closing up of the little spaces where they like to nest.But sparrows are hardy and adaptable, and they like being around us. Recent research shows that the relationship goes back 11,000 years, to the development of agriculture. Their worldwide dispersal only actually came in the last two centuries, coinciding with Victorian expansion of empire, and enabled by genes that allow them to digest starchy grains – an ability lacking in their ancestors.Further along the beach, a Punch and Judy show – another declining species – blares out a tale of cartoon violence and sausages to an appreciative crowd. The gulls and crows – Jets and Sharks – bicker over a discarded sandwich. A lone sparrow pops up to the fringe of the bush and gives an enquiring chirp.

        "text": "Water metering should be made compulsory for all households in England, the government is likely to be told this week, as water supplies come under pressure from increased demand and more frequent droughts and floods.Strain on the UK’s water networks is increasing under the more extreme weather conditions generated by the climate crisis and, under increasing demand, investment by water companies has not kept up.No new large reservoirs have been constructed in England in at least 30 years, and leaks from pipes still amount to about a third of water wasted.Managing demand through metering is therefore unavoidable, a panel of independent experts convened by the government is likely to find.The National Infrastructure Commission will publish its comprehensive assessment of the UK’s critical infrastructure, the first for five years, on Wednesday.Covering everything from energy and transport to water and waste, it is expected to find large gaps in investment and many areas in which the UK’s existing infrastructure is poorly maintained and inadequate.The commission, set up under George Osborne when he was chancellor of the exchequer with the aim of advising government on vital investment, is also likely to warn that the UK is falling behind on the infrastructure needed to meet the legally binding goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and to protect against the probable impacts of the climate crisis.Many of the commission’s findings are likely to be controversial, particularly in light of recent government announcements. The cancellation of the northern leg of HS2 has thrown out plans for public transport across the north of England, and delays to the phase-out of gas boilers have implications for gas use and energy needs for decades.Water is likely to be one of the most hotly contested issues. Sewage in rivers has provoked widespread public anger and, although few people have yet experienced problems with their water supply, that too is likely to start happening, as water supplies are not keeping pace with demand.Water companies have extracted about £72bn in dividends since privatisation, but are asking for investment of about £96bn to alleviate the sewage crisis and safeguard supplies. Most or all of that will have to come from billpayers under the current system.The commission is likely to find that up to nine new large reservoirs are needed, as well as enlargement of some existing reservoirs, and a plethora of water recycling plants. Nine new desalination plants could also be necessary.Increases in supply are unlikely to solve the problem on their own as the climate crisis gets worse and droughts and floods become more common across the UK. Managing demand will therefore be necessary, and compulsory water metering is viewed as the best means of achieving that.Water metering has been controversial in the past, as social campaigners have raised concerns over the impacts on large families on low incomes. However, water companies could be empowered to offer a range of tariffs that would mean large households, or households with special needs, could afford their bills.Water metering would also ensure that people on high incomes who use outsize quantities of water for leisure purposes were fairly charged.At present, people with large water usage, such as for big gardens or swimming pools – including the prime minister, Rishi Sunak – are able to use as much water as they wish, without having to install compulsory meters.Downing Street did not respond to the Guardian’s question of whether Sunak had a water meter installed with his swimming pool at his home in North Yorkshire. The pool required an upgrade to the local electricity grid, with the cost paid by the prime minister, the Guardian revealed earlier this year.Government intervention will be required to install compulsory meters, as in many areas water companies lack the powers to install them, outside areas judged to be under water stress.A legally binding target is already in place to reduce water consumption by 20% a person by 2038, falling further by 2050, from about 145 litres a day to 110.The National Infrastructure Commission has hinted in the past that more water metering would be needed, though it has previously stopped short of making it an official recommendation.Sir John Armitt, chair of the commission, said as drought gathered pace last summer that he viewed water metering as a necessary step."

        "text": "Sir Keir Starmer has been admirably straightforward about his mission to make Britain a “clean energy superpower”. Blocking new oil and gas fields is a sine qua non to realise that ambition. The Labour leader even went to the lion’s den of Davos earlier this year to give business leaders that message.But judging from the headlines over the past few days, you might be forgiven for thinking that Sir Keir had never uttered a word about his plans. Or that Labour had not argued that a big public investment programme was needed to green the economy. The Conservative press instead said Labour’s ideas were a “gift to Putin”; raised a “£28bn question”; and were a sure sign that eco-friendly donors were being appeased. Such a tendentious reading of policy gives opportunistic bunkum a bad name.It is hard not to think that the reason for all the fuss is the imminent decision on the North Sea’s biggest undeveloped oil and gas field, Rosebank. Rishi Sunak has drawn a clear political dividing line with Labour by saying it makes “no sense” not to invest in it. Yet this is the economics of the madhouse. Equinor, the majority Norwegian state-owned company behind Rosebank, made £62bn last year. But it only has to lay out £350m to develop Rosebank because Mr Sunak will subsidise the venture to the tune of £3.75bn. The jobs created are those of a fading industry, not a future one.There are dozens more offshore fields coming up for approval over the next four years. None should go ahead – with or without government handouts – because the carbon extracted would contribute to wrecking the planet. This is not about energy security. Fossil fuel prices are set on international markets – and any piped from the UK’s continental shelf would not insulate the country from global shocks. Rather than attacking Labour, the current Tory party chair, Greg Hands, should remember he had made this very point last year. Neither would North Sea hydrocarbons reduce Britain’s exposure to fickle markets over which petrostates and dictatorships attempt to exert control.The opposition’s plans are more in tune with the government’s expert advisers on the climate change committee who said last year: “The best way of reducing the UK’s future exposure to these volatile prices is to cut fossil fuel consumption on the path to net zero – improving energy efficiency, shifting to a renewables-based power system and electrifying end uses in transport, industry and heating.” Labour’s “Green Prosperity Plan” needs sharpening, not discarding. As the thinktank Common Wealth has shown, every aspect of the UK’s energy system is privatised, which has led to structurally higher prices and a lack of state control over its development. Using public money to stoke a private investment boom won’t guarantee a green transition, let alone a just one.That is why it is heartening that Labour is looking at government solutions again. The opposition plans an £8bn green sovereign wealth fund that would take public stakes in clean investments as well as the creation of a publicly owned renewable energy producer called Great British Energy. Both see democratically controlled industrial policy, rather than a pro-corporate one, manage the transition from fossil fuels. There currently exists a chasm between the ecologically necessary and the politically possible. Sir Keir’s policies attempt to bridge the gap, while the Tories are merely content with letting delusions rush in to fill it."

        "text": "For centuries, narwhals and ringed seals have provided food for Inuit communities on the ice floes of Mittimatalik, or Pond Inlet, on northern Canada’s Baffin Island. But now, the Inuit – who have hunted, trapped and fished in the region since long before the Hudson Bay Company opened its first Arctic trading camp here in 1921 – say they no longer find the narwhals where they should be. They say shipping noise is to blame.Narwhal can only be spotted further out to sea, near Baffin Island, Canada. Photograph: Wildestanimal/AlamyResearchers have likened the passing of a single ice-breaker, increasingly present in the Arctic, to an underwater rock concert. Ship noise can be caused by everything from propellers to hull form to onboard machinery. It can disrupt activities that marine mammals need to survive, by shrinking their communication space, causing stress and displacing them from important habitats.Underwater noise from increasing ship traffic has doubled in intensity in the Arctic over the past six years, and is expected to at least double again over the next decade, as the ice melts and new shipping routes open due to the climate crisis.“The Inuit community on Mittimatalik has observed an increase in shipping and shipping noise, and harvesters are not seeing narwhals in their usual spots,” said Lisa Koperqualuk, president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC). “They have to go further away to hunt them, which carries risks, costs more in fuel and affects the transfer of cultural knowledge.”Local children stand on the shore as the Coast Guard ship Des Groseilliers sits in the waters near the Arctic community of Pond Inlet, Nunavut Photograph: Reuters/AlamyThis week, the ICC, a body representing 180,000 Inuit in Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Chukotka in Russia, has urged the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) to adopt mandatory measures to reduce underwater shipping noise, which they fear is affecting marine mammals.Although the Inuit depend on shipping for essential goods and services, they want to ensure ships have a low impact on the Arctic environment, which is sensitive to underwater noise as well as other pollution, Koperqualuk said.A sign outside a cultural centre on Baffin Island. Inuit groups fear that disruption to hunting will also affect the transfer of knowledge to younger generations. Photograph: Karen Foley/Alamy“Bowhead whales, belugas, ringed seals and narwhals – these are the main marine mammals that we depend on and Inuit harvesters harvest every year,” said Koperqualuk. “If the Inuit hunt is impacted, then the transfer of knowledge is also impacted. There is less opportunity for the younger generations to learn.”Underwater ship noise is known to affect some species of whale, including narwhals and belugas, as well as fish such as Arctic cod, according to the Arctic Council, an international forum of the eight Arctic countries and six Arctic Indigenous groups, including the ICC.In 2014, the IMO approved guidelines for reducing underwater noise from commercial shipping, and this week it is discussing whether to revise them at a London meeting on ship design. The Inuit body wants mandatory guidelines, while Canada proposes a working group specifically to look at noise.The committee is also responsible for incorporating Indigenous knowledge into its work, enabling Inuit and Indigenous communities to engage in the process as well as exploring ways to increase uptake of the guidelines.Inuit groups and other NGOs say the voluntary nature of the guidelines mean there has been little progress on underwater shipping noise reduction. A study by Transport Canada, the Chamber of Shipping of America and WWF Canada reported that a key barrier limiting uptake of the guidelines was their non-binding, non-regulatory nature.High levels of ‘forever chemical’ found in endangered orcas in CanadaRead moreMeanwhile, underwater shipping noise continues to double approximately every decade, disproportionately affecting the Arctic and Norwegian seas.Sarah Bobbe, Arctic program manager at Ocean Conservancy, urged the IMO to act. “In addition to global measures, even more stringent regional measures to reduce acoustic pollution from vessels in areas such as the Arctic will be necessary,” she said.The Arctic is a special case, she said, because of the way in which sound propagates over long distances, how it can affect marine life and because the resulting effect on Inuit communities."

He was well known in environmental health and housing circles for his work on regulatory reform of housing renewal assistance in 2002 and his drafting, in the early 1990s, of a consultation paper on the licensing of bedsits and other houses in multiple occupation.The proposals in his paper were blocked by the government at the time, but licensing eventually came into being with the Housing Act of 2004. Jeff was also involved, behind the scenes, in the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002, which introduced the concept of commonhold as an alternative to leasehold for flats and other properties.Born in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, the second son of Olive (nee Butts), a homemaker, and James, a local government officer, he went to Wintringham grammar school and then Manchester University, where he read economics. After graduating in 1970 he joined the civil service as an economist, later gaining an MSc at the London School of Economics in 1974, which he worked on part-time.He switched to work on policy and administration, ending up as a principal civil servant, although he could probably have gone higher were it not for his tendency to be outspoken and to vigorously defend his staff when he thought superiors were in the wrong.His first area of work at the DoE (and its successors) was on derelict land regeneration, and later he was at the Government Office for London, looking at policies to regenerate the East End. There was then a secondment to the London borough of Kingston, where he prepared a report on how tram systems could be provided in the area.Always a popular speaker at conferences for environmental health officers, he could be charmingly indiscreet and, unlike so many civil servants, did not always play a straight bat. He was also unusually keen to leave the office and meet those affected by decisions taken in Whitehall.Held in high regard by local government employees, who saw him as one of the good guys, he was a member of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health’s Commission on Housing Renewal and Public Health until he took early retirement at 58.Afterwards he worked for Citizens Advice in Kingston for eight years, taking great pride in helping clients through the maze of local and national government bureaucracy, before spending time enjoying his allotment, walking, birdwatching and sampling good food and wine.Jeff is survived by his wife, Ann O’Sullivan, whom he married in 2004, two children, Tessa and Adam, from his first marriage to Linda (nee Ross), which ended in divorce in 1995, and his brother Doug."

Scientists think this stops eggs being smothered by detritus that floats down and settles in thick layers on the sea bed.   Photograph: Courtesy of William T White/CSIROA scientific survey 40 years ago collected one of these cases and for years it sat on a museum shelf. More recently, scientists examined it again and realised it was unlike any other shark eggs, with unique, T-shaped ridges running along its 5cm (2in) length.This finding sparked a shark egg hunt through museum collections, which eventually led to a new species being discovered. This is Apristurus ovicorrugatus – the ghost catshark with corrugated eggs.A lot of sharks give birth to live young, and some – including more than 40 species of ghost catsharks – lay eggs in which the pups gestate for as long as a year before wriggling out into the sea.When the unusual Western Australian egg case was first examined in 2011, scientists found a tiny embryo preserved inside and identified it as a ghost catshark.But they did not know which of a number of species it might be. They ruled out several Australian varieties that lay smooth egg cases, including the Pinocchio and bulldog catsharks, and narrowed it down to either a bighead or freckled catshark.In 2017, Will White, an ichthyologist with the Australian National Fish Collection, picked up the trail of the enigmatic fish. He and his team searched collections and found more ridged egg cases that had been caught in the same region off north-western Australia, as well as a preserved female catshark.Inside her body was an unborn egg case. They carefully took it out and saw it was a perfect match for the other ridged cases, proving this was the species they were looking for.“We were lucky in the end with this one that we managed to find all the pieces of the puzzle,” says White.The half-metre-long female had previously been identified as a freckled ghost catshark. When White and the other researchers took a closer look they decided it was something new, partly because of the shining white irises in her cat-like, oval eyes.There’s a lot of potential risk to the species, even though it might not be getting caught itselfWill White, ichthyologistThere are various ideas as to why these ghost catsharks evolved deeply ridged egg cases. “It’s such a unique design and a very strong design,” says White. The ridges are similar in shape to iron girders. “It definitely adds a lot of strength to the walls of those egg cases.”The ghost catsharks may have evolved this shape to evade predators. Sea snails are known to attack shark egg cases, drilling a hole then slurping out the contents. “There’s no way a snail would be able to stick on to the surface of a ridged egg case,” White says.An embryonic egg case showing the distinctive ridges.   Photograph: William T White/CSIROAs for their habit of laying eggs on tree-like corals, White thinks this probably prevents the eggs from getting buried in organic detritus, known as marine snow, which floats down into the deep sea and smothers the seabed.More than 5,000 new species discovered in Pacific deep-sea mining hotspotRead moreBut this puts the ghost catsharks at high risk from human activities that disturb seabed ecosystems, such as deep-sea trawling and mining.“If [trawling and mining are] wiping out all the corals, then there’s a lot of potential risk to the species, even though it might not be getting caught itself,” says White."

They emerge in early summer, when we hope the skies will be bluest, and make them bluer still. “The jacaranda flames on the air like a ghost,” the Australian poet Douglas Stewart wrote, “Like a purer sky some door in the sky has revealed.”Their blossoms fall, turning the ground to the sky, like still water reflecting clouds, and in the middle is us, bobbing happily up and down.Johannesburg, where I grew up, has South American jacarandas, too. They were introduced there by the English, too. The light in my home city isn’t as thick or as soft as Sydney’s; it is thinner and brighter. But the landscape, with no sea to interrupt it, is more thoroughly blanketed by trees, any trees, than Sydney is, and viewed from on top of a hill, it is purpler.A man pushes his bicycle under jacaranda trees as they bloom in the Melville suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa. Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/EPAIn summer, when my sister and I were small, my father would take us around our quiet neighbourhood on the way home from school or the shops to find the purplest streets. We would open the windows and drive round block after block, close to the kerb, to hear the blossoms popping underneath the tyres. My sister, my father and I were perfectly happy in those moments: content with just us and our neighbourhood and the groceries in the car.I like to think about it but, when I do, I also think about walking through the neighbourhood with my mother (my parents were divorced and lived a few blocks apart) and cornettos, and her warning us to be careful picking up the flowers because there might be bees inside them. I practise jacaranda magical thinking to keep the worlds apart: driving gleefully over the flowers to hear them pop, and walking gently near them to be careful of the bees.Jacarandas in Sydney.

Bee eyes evolved before flowers did, and a bee has an eye that is, “maximally sensitive to blue, green and ultraviolet”.A bee flies above the jacarandas, so pleased with herself for having bent an entire city to her will. Then she dives into a purple tree and crawls into a jacaranda flower – which is nothing if not a perfect sleeping bag for a bee. Her tiny weight causes the flower to fall to the ground. This is her reward for making us so happy: nobody experiences the purple light as totally as the bee inside her petal trumpet.\nHelen Sullivan is a Guardian journalist.

        "text": "Drought is threatening some British moth species with local extinction, a study has found, as the insects are no longer being seen in areas which are becoming drier and hotter.The new research, published today by wildlife charity Butterfly Conservation and Northumbria University, looked at data gathered over a 40-year period by volunteers of Butterfly Conservation’s National Moth Recording Scheme.It found that cool-adapted moths, which once thrived in many habitats in Britain, have retreated towards the north-west where temperatures are lower, with some species dying out completely in warmer, drier more southerly and easterly parts. Most of the cool-adapted moth species have declined in number in recent decades.One moth that has suffered is the garden tiger, whose numbers fell by an alarming 89% between 1968 and 2002. The caterpillars are adapted to survive long frosty winters.Scientists said these local extinctions occurred in the warmest parts of Britain, but that the threat to the moths was greatly reduced where annual rainfall was also high. While further research is needed as to why this is, researchers said it could be because the plants that the moths’ caterpillars rely upon for food survive better when there is more rainfall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

All of these activities would retain water which would benefit moths and other wildlife.Dr Lisbeth Hordley, a postdoctoral researcher at Butterfly Conservation and lead author of the study, said: “Cold-adapted species, like the British moths in our study, are likely to be the first to struggle as the climate warms. Unfortunately, as climate change worsens, more areas in Britain will see the high temperatures that are driving these moths to extinction, so adapting land management to increase water retention is even more important to safeguard such species.”As the climate continues to change, the UK is becoming more susceptible to droughts, with a bout of dry weather last year causing record-breaking low rivers, which is continuing to have effects this year.Dr Richard Fox, head of science at Butterfly Conservation and co-author of the research, added: “Thanks to the efforts of thousands of volunteer moth recorders over the past 40 years, we now know that there is a strong link between warming temperatures and the decline of many species that live in cooler parts of Britain. Although that’s really bad news for the insects, the records gathered by these citizen scientists have also shown how we can increase the resilience of these species, at the same time as benefiting people, by retaining more water in river catchments.“Existing Butterfly Conservation projects such as the Bog Squad, which is re-wetting damaged peat bogs in Scotland, are already providing such benefits but much more is required to protect wildlife and people as the climate crisis grows.”"

        "text": "Last month, twin cyclones tore through Port Vila, the capital of the Pacific nation of Vanuatu. The category-four storms left corrugated iron roofs crumpled like leftover wrapping paper, flooded the streets with waste-ridden mud, cut residents off from water and electricity for several days, and sent many fleeing to hastily established evacuation centres.Devastation of this sort is becoming more common throughout the Pacific, where rising sea levels are leaving shorelines increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather made more intense by climate change.It is partly because of such crises that Vanuatu has introduced a resolution to the UN, co-sponsored by more than 100 other nations and set to be voted on this week, calling for the international court of justice (ICJ) to set out for the first time the obligations states have under international law to fight climate change, and specify any consequences they should face for inaction.The resolution emerged out of frustration with the mismatch between the global community’s rhetoric and action on climate change, which routinely left Pacific activists and diplomats feeling “very disillusioned and disappointed”, says Kevin Chand, the legal adviser to Vanuatu’s mission to the United Nations. The global community “has been making progress, but it isn’t making progress fast enough when we in the Pacific are very vulnerable to climatic events”.As Pacific islanders, we are leading the way to end the world’s addiction to fossil fuels | Ralph Regenvanu Seve PaeniuRead moreAdvisory opinions by the ICJ are not binding on domestic courts. By establishing international legal rules, however, they can be influential sources of pressure on judges and governments. Vanuatu hopes an advisory opinion that sets out stricter climate obligations would strengthen climate-related lawsuits around the world and empower vulnerable nations in international climate negotiations.Vanuatu already appears to have won majority support for its proposal, which is scheduled for a vote in the UN general assembly on Wednesday; 117 nations are co-sponsoring the draft resolution.The campaign to secure an advisory opinion began four years ago in a classroom at the Fijian campus of the University of the South Pacific, where several law students were debating how best to draw the plight of their Pacific homelands to global attention. After striking upon the idea of an advisory opinion, they began lobbying their governments to support it.Previous attempts by the Marshall Islands, Palau, and Bangladesh to seek an advisory opinion had stalled. But Pacific nations soon took up the law students’ call. They gradually won support from other small nations in Africa and the Caribbean, then secured the backing of more ambitious developed nations.Vanuatu avoided singling out individual countries in its request to the ICJ, which has helped it draw support from large emitters like the UK and Australia. Other influential nations like the US and China have not yet expressed a public opinion on the proposal, but one person involved in the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity says both countries have indicated they would support it.The person believes that Vanuatu’s campaign had been aided by the Pacific’s growing geostrategic prominence as the US and China compete for influence in the region. “Politics in the Pacific is very charged at the moment. It’s worked in our favour because it means that we have some leverage,” they say. “It gives us some opportunity to make moves like this because the big players don’t want to offend the Pacific Islands.”Meanwhile, as these international debates play out, several thousand people in Vanuatu are still living in evacuation centres after the damage wreaked across their country by the twin cyclones. For them, advocates say, an advisory opinion strengthening the obligations on large emitters cannot come soon enough.“Extreme weather events are becoming the new normal in our country as a result of climate change,” says Odo Tevi, Vanuatu’s ambassador to the UN. “For low-lying countries, it’s an existential threat.” Accordingly, says Tevi, “We need the global community to act.”"

Then, as support grew, they set up the Vidyasagar Jeev Daya Parivar Trust last year.It began, says Amit, with a chance encounter in 2018. “One day, during our commute to work, we came across a heartwrenching scene. A helpless bird was entangled by its wing, dangling from a branch. We couldn’t remain passive,” he says.After trying to free the trapped bird for half an hour, the Jain brothers called in the local firefighters.

They blamed melting glaciers as well as the thawing of permafrost due to the climate crisis for the collapse, which occurred on Sunday and was captured on film by mountain rescuers training in the region.The witness video, which was published in the Tiroler Tageszeitung, showed scree and rocks hurtling towards the valley. Authorities said that no one was hurt.Police helicopters flew above the 2 sq km area affected, looking for people who might have been caught up in the avalanche but reported finding no evidence of anyone having come to harm.Last month the Swiss village of Brienz in Graubünden had to be evacuated after its 50 residents were warned that similar conditions on the huge, 2m cubic metres of rock formations overlooking the community were in imminent danger of collapsing.Since the clearance of the village, a number of rocks, small and large, have broken off and fallen in the direction of the village. The Swiss tabloid Blick has erected a camera in the area to capture the drama via a livestream link, but experts say they have been unable to judge how much rock has so far fallen.Since Sunday’s collapse of Fluchthorn, mountaineers have raised concerns about one of the most popular summits in the Allgäu Alps, the Hochvogel, which is just kilometres away in southern Germany.But authorities have said despite the fact it has been slowly disintegrating over several years, and a massive rock avalanche was a possibility, the danger of it collapsing was not thought to be imminent.If the mass of rock – estimated to be up to 260,000 cubic metres in size, which is showing visible cracks and fissures on its 2,592-metre high summit – were to fall, it would land in an uninhabited part of the area. At the most, inhabited areas would be affected by resulting clouds of dust, a spokesperson for the Oberallgäu district told local media. A hiking path in that location was closed more than a decade ago because of the dangers of rockfall."

As well as preserving the food, lacto-fermentation has also had the benefit of improving the flavour, adding complexity and umaminess.This recipe is an effective way of preserving a glut of super-ripe, extra-flavourful tomatoes, or turning unripe, flavourless tomatoes into something delicious. Now they are in season, keep your eyes peeled for bargain bags of ripe tomatoes at the market.When fermenting food, it is important that it is well salted, to create an environment suitable for the good bacteria to thrive and dominate. Although some fermented foods contain less salt, a ratio of 2% salt to the weight of the rest of the prepared ingredients is normally recommended as safe.Lacto-fermented harissa ketchupHarissa is delicious, but super spicy. This is my version, which is made with squishy, ripe tomatoes to soften the heat and allow generous application. We serve it at Poco Cafe on a slow-roast lamb kebab and in a halloumi wrap. It’s also lovely with brunch, or almost any dish you fancy a little spicy ketchup on. It’s a great way to preserve a glut of super-ripe tomatoes or to turn flavourless unripe tomatoes into something very flavourful. Add between 100 and 200g chillies, depending on whether you prefer a mild or medium-hot sauce. I usually make a mild sauce with 100g chillies, then add extra chilli flakes to a dish if I want additional heat.Makes About 900g2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil1 small red onion (about 70g), roughly chopped 4 large garlic cloves, peeled2 tbsp cider vinegar3½ tsp sea salt2 tsp sugar2 tsp cumin seeds2 tsp smoked paprika2 tsp caraway seeds1kg very ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped100g or 200g red chillies (for a mild or medium hot sauce)1 red bell pepper (about 150g)Put the oil in a saucepan on a medium heat. Add the onion and saute, stirring, for five minutes. Add the whole garlic cloves, along with the vinegar, salt, sugar, cumin, smoked paprika and caraway, then fry, stirring, for two minutes more. Add the tomatoes, bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, or until reduced by half.Meanwhile, in a dry frying pan, blacken the chillies and whole bell pepper . Once charred on one side, turn and char another. Repeat until blistered all over and softened.Pluck off and compost the stalks, then put all the chillies and pepper in a blender with the spiced tomatoes. Pulse blend into an even but textured sauce. Transfer into clean bottles or jars, with the lids loosely placed on top. Leave at room temperature to ferment for four to 14 days, or until bubbles begin to form. Keep in a cool, dark cupboard or fridge for three to six months.\nThis article was amended on 27 June 2023 to increase the amount of salt in the recipe. Text was also added to offer further information about safe fermentation methods.\n"

        "text": "The Scottish government has ditched controversial marine protection plans after a furious backlash that united coastal communities, grassroots campaigners and sectors of the fishing industry.Holyrood’s net zero secretary, Màiri McAllan, promised “further community and industry engagement” as she announced on Thursday the end of proposals to implement highly protected marine areas (HPMAs) that would impose strict limits on human activity such as fishing, aquaculture and tourism in at least 10% of Scotland’s waters by 2026.Restating her government’s commitment to enhanced marine protection, McAllan said a new pathway and timetable would be published after the summer recess.Advocates say “no-take zones” are a moderate step, widely used across Europe and piloted in England by the UK government, and that they are essential for the recovery of depleted coastal fish stocks and seabeds. Local attempts to “rewild” the sea, such as the no-take zone established in 2008 in Lamlash Bay on Arran, have been successful, they add.But grassroots campaigners, usually at odds with each other over other issues, argued the plans – a key part of the Bute House agreement that brought the Scottish Greens into government with the SNP in 2021 – would devastate island cultures, in particular. The Scottish government also faced cross-sector criticism of the policy as poorly evidenced and dismissive of local experience.The plans exposed significant tensions within the SNP, in particular over the influence of its Green governing partners on controversial policy and a Holyrood vote on the subject resulting in the first backbench rebellion since Humza Yousaf became first minister.Responding to McAllan’s statement, the Scottish Greens coastal communities spokesperson, Ariane Burgess, accused opposition parties of trying to “weaponise the nature emergency” and welcomed the commitment to “community-led input”.The former SNP leadership contender Kate Forbes, who rebelled against her government on the issue, said the announcement would “come as an immense relief to those who understood the risk to coastal communities from the very beginning”.“It is now critical that any new proposals for marine protected areas take into account communities’ views, fishermen’s lived experiences and the importance of a truly just transition,” she said.Phil Taylor, the director of the conservation charity Open Seas, who previously spoke of “complete entrenchment” over the proposals, said: “The Scottish government are now learning an important lesson that deep community engagement and participation is fundamental to effective environmental action.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scottish ministers must prioritise action on these most destructive fishing methods to secure real sustainability for our seas and fisheries.”"

If Al Jaber is serious – if we are serious – we must immediately reject the CCS [carbon capture and storage] false solution and tackle the existential oil and gas problem head on.’’The research, based on production data from industry analysts Rystad, found that between 2023 and 2030 Adnoc’s oil and gas would produce an estimated 3,430m tonnes of carbon, including emissions from producing and burning fossil fuels.By 2030, the company has pledged to increase the amount of carbon it captures to 10m tonnes per annum – a big jump from its current level. But even if it reaches that target, it would still take the company more than 340 years to capture the carbon it produces between now and 2030.Noronha Gant said: “Carbon capture is a dangerous red herring, and Al Jaber need to look no further than his own oil company for proof.”Campaigners are concerned that Al Jaber is going to use the Cop28, which starts next month in the United Arab Emirates, to promote technical solutions instead of pushing for large and rapid reductions in fossil fuel production and emissions.In May this year he said: “If we are serious about curbing industrial emissions, we need to get serious about carbon capture technologies.”Earlier this year, the Guardian revealed that the United Arab Emirates has the third biggest expansion plans for oil and gas in the world – surpassed only by Saudi Arabia and Qatar.And as the climate crisis accelerates, with 2023 on course to be the hottest year on record, there has been widespread criticism of UAE as the host nation for Cop28 and of Al Jaber as president.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A fellow youth climate justice organiser, Eric Njuguna from Kenya, called it “a stab in the back for poor countries to have a fossil fuel CEO on top of efforts to constrain the climate crisis”.Campaigners have long rejected CCSas a climate solution, arguing it is being used by fossil fuel companies to claim they are cleaning up their act, while expanding their fossil fuel operations and pumping millions of tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere with devastating consequences.In the US, a large percentage of CCS projects have failed, and a study in 2021 found that even among those that were successful, 81% of the carbon captured was actually used to produce more fossil fuels, as it was pumped underground to force out oil and gas.In response to today’s findings, Adnoc said it had “taken significant steps to decarbonise” its operations.The company also said that CCS was a “critical tool in holding back emissions” and that the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said CCS would play an “important and diverse role” in meeting climate goals."

        "text": "There comes a time in a dung beetle’s life when the only hope of overcoming an obstacle without losing their prized ball is a partner who can pull off a decent headstand.When their path is blocked, pairs of dung beetles carefully coordinate their actions, with males grabbing the dung ball from above, and females going into a headstand to push the ball off the ground with their legs, researchers say.The unusual, cooperative behaviour between spider dung beetles is believed to be a unique example of animals other than humans working together to move objects around without knowing their final destination.While ants coordinate to haul food to their nests, and social spiders cooperate to carry prey to their shelters, both know where they are heading and when they have arrived. With dung beetles, couples start rolling their dung balls with no idea where they will stop.“It’s the first species that’s been recorded that can coordinate transport in this way,” said Dr Claudia Tocco, who studies animal behaviour at Lund University in Sweden. “They don’t know where they are going, but they can still coordinate to move the object together.”Tocco investigated South African spider dung beetles in the hope of learning what pairing-up achieved. In other species of dung beetle that roll balls in pairs, females catch a ride by clinging to balls of dung, or walk behind their ball-rolling male.She gave dung beetles access to cow dung and compared how well single beetles and mating pairs rolled the balls when obstacles of different heights blocked their path. The particular species live in forests and face constant obstructions in the shape of plants and rocks. They bury the balls for food or to lay eggs in.The researcher found that male beetles always took the role of dung ball dragger, grabbing the ball with their front legs as they walked backwards. Females always helped from behind, walking backwards with their rear legs up on the ball.On flat ground, pairs of beetles rolled no faster than single males, but faced with hurdles, the couples surged ahead. When challenged by walls up to 9cm tall, males started to climb and drag the ball up, as females worked themselves into a headstand and pushed with their legs to help the ball off the ground. The females then held on to the ball as the male pulled it up – lifting about 10 times his body weight.At times, males clung to walls with only one claw and females repeatedly saved them from falls when they lost grip, the scientists wrote in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Pairs of beetles were faster than single ones and more efficient over obstacles, which would be “extremely beneficial” in the forest, the authors noted.But while pairing up makes sense, how the beetles coordinate their actions remains a mystery. “How does a beetle with a brain smaller than a grain of rice communicate? And how do they coordinate with each other in performing this task?” said Tocco. “They don’t know where they are going.”"

        "text": "Rishi Sunak has made a series of claims about the UK’s climate record in defence of his net zero rollback. Speaking at a press conference during a short visit to the Cop28 climate conference in Dubai, the prime minister insisted he had not faced any criticism from other world leaders for watering down his climate pledges.Claim: the UK has decarbonised faster than any major economyThis is true to an extent: according to some models, since the 1990s the UK has decarbonised faster than other large economies. This is because it was once very dependent on coal and was fast to phase it out. However, look at more recent times and the picture changes. Recent data shows Germany has cut greenhouse gas emissions faster than the UK since the 2015 Paris agreement to limit global warming. The UK was good at moving past the age of coal but it is going to be difficult to keep up with countries that have less stringent planning rules on solar and wind, more nuclear power stations, and less leaky, better-insulated homes.Claim: the UK is one of the largest climate donorsAccording to Seek development, the UK is the world’s 13th largest climate donor. As it is the sixth largest economy by GDP according to the World Bank, the UK could do better.Claim: the UK will meet its climate targets even with rollback on net zeroSunak claimed the UK would still be on track to meet its carbon targets despite the changes he announced. The government’s own climate change committee has worked out that the changes will make this more difficult.Claim: rollback on heat pump and insulation pledges will save families thousands of poundsThis is debatable. While Sunak has brought forward some exemptions for the gas and oil boiler phase-out, there were always going to be exemptions for people who would find it difficult to heat their home any other way. No one was ever going to be forced to have a heat pump – they could heat their home by another method that did not involve a fossil-fuel boiler. And the insulation rules he scrapped were only for landlords, who were going to be made to ensure their tenants lived in a home they could heat affordably. So while this will save landlords thousands of pounds, it may end up costing renters more.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "The toppling of a tree, without injury, in a city churchyard would not normally make news headlines, but the mighty ash outside London’s Old St Pancras church was one of the capital’s most venerated natural landmarks and a destination of literary pilgrimage. Encircled with gravestones that it seemed to be absorbing into its root system, the Hardy Tree acquired its name, and its celebrity, from a story that the poet and novelist Thomas Hardy, then a young architect’s apprentice in a rapidly growing London, was personally responsible for stacking its trunk with stones cleared to make way for the expansion of the Midland railway line in the mid-1860s.By Hardy’s time, the literary pedigree of Old St Pancras churchyard was well-established. It was the original resting place of the pioneering feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, whose daughter Mary Shelley was said to have gone there for secret trysts with her future husband, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. Hardy himself wrote of overseeing the exhumations. He was charged with turning up at unexpected times to ensure that the clerk of works was doing a respectful job and not simply dumping the bones, as had happened in previous cemetery clearances.What is missing is any evidence that Hardy had any direct involvement in the arrangement of the stones. Moreover, photographs of the churchyard, unearthed by an assiduous amateur historian, suggest that the current ash grew between 1926 and 1960, only later becoming known as the Hardy Tree. That it had no greater verifiable connection with the Victorian author than, say, Sherwood Forest’s Major Oak had with Robin Hood, or Berkshire’s Ankerwycke Yew had with the signing of the Magna Carta, hardly matters. By mere dint of their longevity, trees collect myths and become lightning rods for the historical imagination.The Ankerwycke Yew is the National Trust’s oldest tree, believed to be up to 2,500 years old, and is also said to have witnessed Henry VIII’s courtship of Anne Boleyn. The enduring fascination with Tudor history has ensured its protagonists more than their share of legendary trees, from Queen Mary’s Thorn in St Andrews to the Queen Elizabeth Oak, which has been holding court on its side in Greenwich Park since falling over in 1991.Oaks and yews live for thousands of years; ashes survive for a few hundred if lucky. They are the opportunists of the arboreal world which, until the recent catastrophic arrival of ash dieback, have pushed their way up in the most unlikely of places, providing 5% of the UK’s tree cover. This is what the Hardy ash appears to have done before it succumbed to a common fungal infection.The demise of an old tree is always sad. But perhaps the real story of the Hardy ash is that it wasn’t special; it didn’t witness the canoodlings of the Shelleys, fall in a freak storm or die in a scary, imported pandemic. The entanglement of root and stone reveals a history of nature and humanity competing and coexisting in a swiftly changing industrial landscape. In death, it has grown into its own urban myth."

But just days before they were due to arrive, unprecedented floods devastated the region.While the university’s Lismore campus never flooded, the museum team faced a nervous wait as they assessed the risk to the collection and of heading into the flood zone.Nearly two months later, on 26 April, it was deemed safe for the team to gather the collection and transfer it to the museum in Sydney.Prof Shane Ahyong, the head of marine invertebrates at the Australian Museum, said another week later the site again became inaccessible because of more flooding.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n“The floods continued to get worse and the disaster was in full train. So it was very serendipitous that we were able to get in just in time,” he said.Ahyong said spiny crayfish need pristine water to survive, unlike their inland cousin the yabby, which can tolerate poor water conditions.He said the crayfish have thorny armour – “like little battle tanks” – to protect them against predators, but they are susceptible to habitat change, whether from land clearing or natural disasters.“These can be quite large, spectacular animals,” he said, adding that they are also very diverse.“They only have very narrow distributions, so each river catchment down the coast basically has its own species.”Half of all spiny crayfish species in Australia were affected by the black summer bushfires, and efforts to protect the remaining populations are at risk from further natural disasters and climate change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many of these species are endangered.Birds of Australia: Elizabeth Gould’s stunning illustrations – in picturesRead more“These reference samples make a big difference, because we need to be able to study their anatomy precisely when we discover a new species and distinguish them from the known species,” Ahyong said.“Every specimen that we have increases the accuracy of the work.”Erich Wittstock, a laboratory team leader at Southern Cross University, said the donation of the collection to the Australian Museum meant the museum’s taxonomists could properly preserve specimens for the future.“Without this endeavour, the collection would have been lost,” Wittstock said."

        "text": "Sales of private jets are likely to reach their highest ever level this year, placing an increasing burden on the planet, while many of the owners escape aviation taxes, and there are few curbs on the greenhouse gases emitted, according to a report.The global fleet of private jets has more than doubled in the last two decades, and more private flights were made last year than ever before, according to a thinktank report published on Monday. Greenhouse gas emissions from private aviation have increased by nearly a quarter since the pandemic, when flying of all types nearly ceased in many countries for an extended period.Will flying ever be green? – podcastRead moreThere were 5.3m private flights globally in 2022, according to the report compiled by the US Institute for Policy Studies thinktank and the Patriotic Millionaires US group, which is made up of wealthy individuals pushing for higher wealth taxes.Last year was the first time that private aviation surpassed its previous peak, which came in 2007, before the financial crisis of 2008-09 and global recession. Sales of pre-owned and new private jets are forecast to reach $34.6bn (£27.6bn) this year, up from $34.1bn last year.Although private jet travel makes up only 4% of the global aviation market, it produces about 10 times as much greenhouse gas per passenger.Stephen Prince, the vice-chair of the Patriotic Millionaires, and founder of Card Marketing Services, said he was giving up his aircraft. “Flying on a private jet is amazing, it’s the best travel experience ever,” he said. “But having read this report, I’ve decided to sell my jet. It’s virtually impossible to square any iota of concern about the environment and humanity with the supreme selfishness of jumping on a big jet all by myself. It’s simply not right.”In the US, still the global leader in private and business jet travel, passengers on commercial flights are in effect subsidising private flying. Taxes on private aviation raised only 2% of the tax revenue that is the primary funding for the Federal Aviation Administration, which operates air traffic control, even though private jets accounted for 17% of the flights handled.Chuck Collins, co-author of the report, director of the programme on inequality and the common good, at the Institute for Policy Studies, said: “Private jet travel by billionaires and the ultra wealthy imposes a tremendous cost on the rest of us. Not only do ordinary travellers and taxpayers subsidise the airspace for private jets, but the high flyers also contribute considerably more pollution than other passengers. If we can’t ban private jets, we should at least tax them and require them to pay to offset their environmental damage and subsidies.”The Patriotic Millionaires group recommends a 10% tax on all purchases of second-hand private jets, and a 5% tax on new aircraft. This would have raised $2.6bn in tax last year, the report found. The group also wants at least a doubling of fuel taxes on private jet travel, compared with commercial aviation.Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter and founder of Tesla, who was outraged earlier this year when a tracker published details of his private jet activity, was named in the report as “the most active high flyer in the US”. He bought a new jet, made an estimated 171 flights in 2022, including one that lasted only six minutes, and contributed to the consumption of more than 800,000 litres of jet fuel, and was responsible for more than 2,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.He would have paid $4m in private jet taxes last year, if the proposed tax increases were implemented."

Santos has approval to build a pipeline that would transport the gas from the gas field to Darwin. That approval was paused following the direction issued by Nopsema.Santos wrote in its quarterly report that, after research and interviews, an independent expert had concluded “there were no specific underwater cultural heritage places along the planned Barossa pipeline route that may be affected by the activities covered by the pipeline environmental plan”.Tiwi people questioned this claim and pointed to a section of the expert report that noted a total of 163 features of “palaeogeographic interest and archaeological potential” in the study area.They also said community members had provided “countless testimonies attesting that this site is of critical spiritual significance to Tiwi people”.“Our connection to sea country is way too strong, and it has been since the creation of time for us,” Munupi senior cultural leader and elder Pirrawayingi Puruntatameri said.“The water may have risen and moved over time, but it has never interrupted our spiritual connection to the land that is now underwater.”Santos’s spokesperson said the company’s independent report had concluded that “based on the current level of understanding of the submerged palaeolandscape within the offshore study area, we do not recommend the establishment of any archaeological exclusion zones at this time”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Santos’s environmental plan to commence drilling work is still being assessed by Nopsema. An approval for drilling work was overturned last year after a federal court challenge established that the company had failed to consult Tiwi people about the proposed drilling.In its quarterly report, Santos said the project “remains on target to commence production in the first half 2025 and within current cost guidance” assuming that the drilling work recommenced this year.The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) cast doubt on this statement.“Investors will be questioning Santos on how it can lose a year in the drilling schedule and still be on track,” ACCR executive Brynn O’Brien said."

        "text": "A follow-up to Germany’s immensely popular €9 (£7.90) monthly public transport ticket scheme has been given the green light in the Bundestag, in a move aimed at getting passengers to switch to greener forms of transport.Parliamentarians on Thursday voted to approve plans to introduce a €49-a-month ticket covering regional rail, metro, trams and bus travel across Germany.The vote in parliament cleared the way for the national government to cover half of the scheme’s annual cost of €3bn for the next three years, with the other half paid for by Germany’s 16 federal states.If, as expected, the €49 ticket is given the seal of approval by the German parliament’s upper house, the Bundesrat, on 31 March, the scheme will come into effect on 1 May.The transport minister, Volker Wissing, hailed the new ticket scheme as a “role model for the whole of Europe” that would boost public transport use. Wissing, of the liberal Free Democratic party (FDP), has been under fire over the transport sector’s failure to meet carbon reduction targets.The original €9-a-month ticket scheme was put in place from June to the end of August last year to incentivise travellers to switch to greener forms of transport and give financial relief to consumers facing a cost of living crisis. With about half of Germany’s adult population having taking part in the scheme that the government subsidised with €2.5bn, the ticket was as popular as it was inexpensive.Whether it had a significant positive impact on the environment has been questioned: most Germans used the €9 ticket to travel around the country for leisure, while there has been little statistical evidence showing that those who commute by car changed their transport routines in any meaningful way.The new ticket – being called “Germany ticket” by the government – is hence designed to be most attractive to people who commute in and out of larger cities, where old subscription-based discount schemes are mostly more expensive than €49 a month.The ticket, available in digital form via a smartphone app or as a chip card, will work on a subscription model that can be cancelled before the 10th day of each month, meaning it may still pay off as a one-off investment for some holidays or weekend trips.Long-distance coaches and trains such as those on the high-speed ICE network are not included in the scheme.Due to Germany’s decentralised political system, tickets bought in different cities or regions will come with different rules and add-ons. In the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, people travelling on a €49 ticket can also take a bicycle and a dog no bigger than a cat on the train with them for free.In and around the southern city of Stuttgart, travellers can transfer their ticket subscription to friends, relatives or colleagues if they pay an additional €9.90. States such as Bavaria are offering discounts for students, trainees and those doing voluntary service, who will only have to pay €29 a month."

In Madrid, some nights are equatorial rather than tropical, as the temperature stays above 25C. June was the hottest month recorded on Earth for 120,000 years. The hottest week came early this month. “Very dangerous long-duration heat”, to use the language of the recent alert issued by the US National Weather Service in Arizona, sums up the experience of the last few weeks across much of the northern hemisphere. Extreme heat, wildfires and floods are ravaging parts of the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, India and China.Global heating is not the sole explanation for the hellish impact of Cerberus and Charon, the heatwaves named after mythical denizens of Hades. As in 2016 – the hottest year ever recorded – an emerging El Niño weather pattern is helping drive the barometer upwards. But each time this natural and sporadic event recurs, typically adding 0.2C to the average global temperature, it heats up a planet that is already warmer than before as a result of greenhouse gas emissions.The hotter the Earth gets, the greater the danger of feedback loops and unanticipated events. In Europe, an established high pressure system in the south is currently trapping the region under a heat dome, and unusually high surface temperatures in the Mediterranean are helping to lock in the heat on land. With Cerberus, we have entered, according to the World Meteorological Organization, “uncharted territory”. As soon as this year or next year, say some scientists, global temperatures could breach the all-important 1.5C threshold prioritised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Loss of life, mass migration, crop losses and soaring food prices as a result of extreme weather are already a stark new reality. Worse is almost certainly to come.At an intuitive level, we know this. But faced with these colossal and immediate challenges, European politics is showing alarming signs of drift. The aftermath of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis, and the spectre of economic recession, are combining to drain momentum from net zero targets. Last week, a core piece of the European Union’s green deal was only passed by the narrowest of margins, after being heavily watered down. In key areas for reaching climate neutrality, such as transport, lifestyles and agriculture, progress is too slow.In Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and elsewhere – as Gordon Brown has noted – the radical nationalist right is successfully turning the green agenda into a battleground for its culture wars. In Britain, it has become depressingly clear that the climate emergency is not a priority for Rishi Sunak. The Labour party has meanwhile revised the timetable of its potentially transformative £28bn-a-year green transition plan.After so many IPCC reports, Cop summit communiques and political statements of intent, the idea that these heatwaves could be considered a wake-up call for Europe’s governments and populations seems somewhat otiose. Cerberus and Charon are searing reminders that the climate emergency cannot be put on hold as other crises are addressed. Europe is heating faster than any other continent, but its politics is not keeping pace. Time really is running out; progressive politicians need to rediscover the courage of their convictions and a sense of urgency."

        "text": "Almost a third of presenters on GB News have used their platform to cast doubt on the scientific consensus on climate breakdown, according to an analysis.Ten of the broadcaster’s 31 presenters made statements on air in 2022 rejecting or challenging widely accepted scientific findings about how humans are affecting the climate, and the role the climate crisis plays in extreme weather events.Conspiracy theories, Moggologues and ‘zombie’ stats: all in a week’s work for GB NewsRead moreSixteen presenters used their broadcasts to attack the UK’s climate policies, including claims that measures such as the legally binding net zero target will lead to deaths from poverty and starvation, and “the decline of the west”.Responding to the findings, the Green MP, Caroline Lucas, said: “Climate denial isn’t just factually inaccurate – it’s also deeply dangerous and puts at risk all our society-wide efforts to tackle the climate emergency.“Now more than ever, people deserve trustworthy and accurate news from our media – this truly toxic misinformation on GB News is not it. Ofcom cannot allow these statements to go unchallenged and uninvestigated.”Investigative journalists at the climate website DeSmog scoured hours of online footage of GB News broadcasts hosted on YouTube, inspecting comments made on air by presenters listed on the channel’s website. Six were excluded on the basis they were news anchors or reporters, and so unlikely to express opinions. Of the 31 remaining, 16 attacked climate action on air, while 10 challenged or rejected basic climate science.Summer 2022 brought a record-breaking heatwave, with temperatures in the UK passing 40C (104F) for the first time. The Met Office, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Weather Attribution service all concluded climate breakdown made the heatwave more likely.But when the Met Office warned high temperatures were linked to the climate crisis, the GB News presenter and sometime priest Calvin Robinson accused the official forecaster of “alarmism”. “Manmade climate change, I don’t buy it,” he said on 16 July. “Because how much of an impact do we really make if we’re talking about carbon levels?”On 21 July, the host Bev Turner called heatwave warnings “fearmongering” in order to “facilitate state control over your life”. “Green issue propaganda” was, she claimed, “part of a plan to register us all to a biometric ID and a social credit score system that’ll tell you when you can and can’t leave the house for the sake of the planet”.The UK’s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 was met with similarly extreme criticism. On 5 November, Neil Oliver, whose monologues have become popular on social media, used his show to attack “net zero [and] the green agenda”, which he claimed was part of “a hellish potpourri of policies guaranteed to condemn hundreds of millions to death by poverty, death by starvation”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

GB News is proud to ask difficult questions and to embrace all voices on controversial issues. We believe it’s what good journalism is all about.”"

        "text": "It was never really in doubt. But the first week of Cop28, which ended with a rest day on Thursday, made one crucial fact impossible to ignore: the fossil fuel industry is not planning to go quietly. Far more of its lobbyists are in the UAE than have attended UN climate talks before. One analysis counted 2,456 of them – nearly four times the number registered last year in Egypt.The battle is hotting up over what next week’s report on progress towards the Paris goals, known as the global stocktake, will say. Fossil fuel interests – both corporate and national – are pushing hard to avoid references to the phase-out that would signal the end of their business model and vast profits. They don’t want an energy transition that leads to their demise.Last week, the Guardian revealed that Sultan Al Jaber, who holds the Cop presidency and leads the UAE’s state oil company, recently asserted that “no science” indicates that “a phase-out of fossil fuel is what’s going to achieve 1.5C”. Forced on to the defensive, he later said that “the phase-down and phase-out of fossil fuel is inevitable”. But it is the nations at Cop28 that will decide, and there is no guarantee that any such pledge will appear in the final text.One of the key battlegrounds at Cop28 is that of language: whether fossil fuels will be phased “down” or “out”. The choice is either reducing carbon energy sources or getting rid of them entirely. The latter would be preferable, but there are many other battles to be won. There will be haggling over whether a transition to a cleaner future should see fossil fuels “unabated”, with greenhouse gas emissions released directly into the atmosphere, or “abated”, where carbon capture technology and carbon offsets reduce the harm caused. The latter have so far failed to deliver promised benefits, appearing more of a risk than a solution, in enabling the necessity of replacing fossil fuels to be ducked.Currently, not a single G20 country has policies in place that are consistent with the 1.5C target. Some, including the UK under Rishi Sunak, are moving in the wrong direction. Meanwhile, the former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres highlighted the unfinished business of financing a “global business plan” for decarbonisation. Climate change is eroding poor nations’ development gains, and without cash to adapt, such gains will be unachievable in the future. Yet finance flows to developing countries, according to the UN, are roughly a tenth of the $340bn needed by 2030. Bitter divisions between developing and developed countries on this issue almost derailed climate talks earlier this year.Climate scientists are increasingly desperate. This week, five authors of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports told the Guardian that they want the panel to have a voice on policy as well as the science underpinning it. The emissions-cutting process stewarded by Cop is failing. Although the rate of increase has fallen, overall emissions are still rising, with 2023 expected to set a new record. Perverse though it may seem, in one sense the strenuous efforts of fossil fuel interests to hijack the UN climate process could be seen as a sign of hope. The industry understands that it is under threat. Following through on that threat, by insisting on a just transition to a safer energy system, is the task facing governments and the societies they represent."

        "text": "The unseasonably wet weather is causing problems for this year’s harvest, experts have said, with wheat, barley and hay crops affected.Many farmers have been signed up to a nature-friendly scheme called Mid Tier, which does not allow hay to be cut until July to help wildlife.However, there have been very few dry days since 1 July, leaving farmers insufficient time to cut the grass, spread it out, allow it to dry, row it up and then bale it before it rains again.Prof Nicola Cannon from the Royal Agricultural University said: “Even if the product is being harvested to be used for animals, it still needs to store well without going mouldy as this not only reduces the quality and desirability of the product but also can make it a fire risk.“We all know the phrase ‘make hay while the sun shines’, and the reason for this is that, ideally, grass is cut for hay and dries quickly on a warm and breezy day. It is no different to drying your laundry on a washing line – the thicker and the wetter the clothes, and the stiller or duller the weather, the longer it takes for them to dry.”The wet weather has also affected grain crops, with waterlogged soil making them harder to harvest.Cannon said: “This time of year is when farmers need to harvest winter wheat, which is used for either animal feed or for making biscuits or bread, but the quality of the grain can be seriously damaged if the ripe wheat crop remains in the field because it is too wet to harvest.“Grain that remains unharvested in the field in wet weather can start to sprout and is more likely to develop mould, both of which can lead to it being rejected for bread-making, meaning the farmer then receives a lower price.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Not only does this make it harder to combine but it also reduces air flow around the grain and impedes drying when the weather is finally dry enough to harvest.”"

        "text": "The behemoth Australian fund IFM Investors will sink £10bn (A$19bn) into infrastructure and energy transition projects in Britain by 2027 as part of a new memorandum of understanding with the Sunak government.The decision by IFM – which is owned by 17 Australian industry super funds – comes as a coalition of business and environmental groups calls on the Albanese government to supercharge tax and other financial incentives to ensure Australia can attract sufficient capital to drive the domestic transition to net zero emissions.The MoU between IFM Investors and Britain’s minister for investment will be signed at the Global Investment Summit in London. Kemi Badenoch, the UK’s business and trade secretary, characterised the commitment from IFM as “a very important investment for the UK’s innovative energy and infrastructure sectors”.IFM, which has approximately A$217bn under management as at 30 June 2023, says there are significant investment opportunities in Britain’s energy transition because the country is providing a favourable investment climate.Deepa Bharadwaj, IFM’s head of infrastructure Europe said: “We currently see significant deployment opportunities, particularly as part of the UK energy transition in areas such as offshore wind, solar, battery storage, renewable fuels, and pumped hydro.”Cop28: Australia to bring evidence it can meet 2030 climate target but pressure builds over fossil fuelsRead moreAs IFM expands its investment portfolio in the UK, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Investor Group on Climate Change and WWF Australia will issue a joint statement declaring that Australia risks being left behind in a global race for capital.The statement follows confirmation last week that taxpayers will underwrite the transformation of Australia’s energy grid through a radical expansion of the capacity investment scheme. In the biggest climate and energy policy development in a decade, the government proposes to underwrite 32GW of new electricity, consisting of 9GW of storage and 23GW of variable renewable generation.The Albanese government has sustained faced pressure to respond to the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which includes A$560bn support for clean energy and has escalated global competition for climate-focused investment.The government is looking to expand its $2bn Hydrogen Headstart program and potentially apply that same model to other industries, as part of a response to the challenges posed by the IRA. The business and environmental groups say the Australian government needs to move quickly.“The United States of America and Europe to peers like Canada, have enacted substantial financial incentives and a variety of other supportive policies to drive their transitions, and these are unlocking even larger private investment,” the groups say in the joint statement.“Global capital, skills and supply chains are following the money. Without globally competitive, proportional and smartly targeted incentives of our own, designed to suit our economic strengths and values, Australia will be left behind.”The groups note the climate and energy policies implemented by Labor to date, but say much more is required, including higher investment, sector-by-sector decarbonisation plans, faster implementation and greater coordination of delivery of the policies driving emissions reductions across the economy.“There is a window of opportunity to unlock maximum global capital and foster the skills and supply chains we will need,” the groups say. “The Australian government should act now with a comprehensive set of policy tools, including but not limited to financial and/or tax incentives, that are equal to the immense opportunities and risks confronting us.”Australia’s climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, will this week make an annual climate change statement to parliament and release a new assessment by the Climate Change Authority of Australia’s progress before travelling to the Cop28 summit in the United Arab Emirates."

        "text": "An emergency biosecurity response to a fire ant outbreak in northern New South Wales appears to have contained the extremely invasive species.In November, three red imported fire ant (Rifa) nests were found in Murwillumbah, 13km south of the Queensland border. The pests were detected by a member of the public and were suspected to have been transported from south-east Queensland, where there is a widespread infestation.The invasive species can kill people and livestock as well as damage infrastructure and ecosystems. The National Fire Ant Eradication Program response to the detection included chemically eradicating the nests, baiting the surrounding area, using sniffer dogs to search for further nests and imposing strict limits on movement of farming materials within 5km of the site.At the time, the NSW minister for agriculture, Tara Moriarty, urged vigilance, encouraging the public to be part of surveillance efforts.What are fire ants, and what will happen if these tiny killers take hold across Australia?Read moreNew figures from the state government show the community has made 512 calls to the NSW biosecurity hotline, with all reports of suspected fire ants deemed negative.There have been 283 inspections by staff and detector dog teams since the detection and more than 1,200 drop-ins to the NSW government’s fire ant information bus.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nA further part of the response was to genetically test the ants to determine whether they were linked to the existing infested area in south-east Queensland.Moriarty confirmed the results showed the ants were connected to the known outbreak, suggesting they had been transplanted to the site, possibly in a delivery of turf.“At the time of detection, all fire ant nests were destroyed by direct nest injection and surveillance activity focused on the immediate area to check for additional nests – none were detected,” she said in a statement.“The NSW government is not resting after eradicating the fire ant nests found in South Murwillumbah in late November last year.”Reece Pianta of the Invasive Species Council cautioned the community had a way to go, with an outbreak only truly deemed eradicated when 24 months passed without further detections of Rifa.While the spread beyond containment lines in Queensland was “not great”, it was being addressed effectively, he said.In December, he visited the site with Craig Huf, chair of the Far North Coast branch of the NSW Farmers Association.In addition to the positive genetic link to Queensland and a quick response by authorities and the community, Pianta said the terrain of the site was “in our favour”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Any worker ants remaining would take the bait to the nest and feed it to the queen. The bait turns off fire ant foraging instincts – preventing new colonies from forming.“After decades of under-resourcing, increased fire ant funding is having a positive impact on fire ant responses,” he said.State and federal governments have committed $593m to the eradication of Rifa between 2023 and 2027.“Funding levels should be constantly reviewed to match resource needs on the ground. Eradication is a long complicated process but only eradication can prevent fire ants from spreading into NSW again.”Huf said he welcomed the response so far but the infested area in south-east Queensland was “supposed to be contracting not expanding”.He encouraged more random compliance checks on vehicles travelling from the infested area.Vehicle checks as part of the November operation resulted in 75 heavy vehicle inspections. None were turned around, with the majority showing compliance.Two checkpoints overseen by the NSW Department of Primary Industries and NSW police in September stopped 99 vehicles moving fire ant carrier materials, seven of which were non-compliant and returned to Queensland. Two penalty notices were issued."

        "text": "The UK and Switzerland will see a 30% increase in the number of days of uncomfortably hot temperatures if the world heats by 2C, and are two of the countries which need to adapt the most for global heating, scientists have predicted.The research, published in Nature Sustainability on Thursday, found that while central Africa will see the most extreme temperatures overall, it is mostly northern European countries that will experience the greatest relative increases in uncomfortably hot days.The people and infrastructure in these countries are not prepared for periods of hot weather, the study, based on climate modelling and data from the UK Met Office, predicts. The estimates by researchers at the University of Oxford are conservative, and do not include external factors such as extreme heatwaves, which would come on top of this average increase.Prairie planting takes root in UK as gardeners battle drought and floodsRead moreNorway will also suffer one of the world’s most dramatic increases in days that require cooling interventions, the study finds, with a 28% increase in days with uncomfortably hot temperatures if the world misses the 1.5C target. Eight of the 10 countries with the greatest relative increase in uncomfortably hot days are expected to be in northern Europe.Researchers said northern European countries had not prepared for sustainable cooling alternatives as homes become uncomfortably hot in the summer months and infrastructure struggles to cope above certain temperatures. Cooling measures needed to face these temperatures include making use of natural ventilation, external solar protection such as window shutters and fans.“For example, sustainable cooling barely has a mention in the UK’s net zero strategy,” said co-author Dr Radhika Khosla, an associate professor at Oxford’s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment and leader of the Oxford Martin programme on the future of cooling.She said air conditioning could add to the problem if the grid was not decarbonised and fossil fuels were used to cool homes: “Without adequate interventions to promote sustainable cooling we are likely to see a sharp increase in the use of energy guzzling systems like air conditioning, which could further increase emissions and lock us into a vicious cycle of burning fossil fuels to make us feel cooler while making the world outside hotter.”Currently, buildings in northern Europe are often made to trap heat in the cold seasons and can become swelteringly hot in summer. This needs to change if the world hits 2C of heating and the country faces a new, hotter climate.The co-lead author Dr Jesus Lizana said: “If we adapt the built environment in which we live, we won’t need to increase air conditioning. But right now, in countries like the UK our buildings act like greenhouses: no external protection from the sun in buildings, windows locked, no natural ventilation and no ceiling fans. Our buildings are exclusively prepared for the cold seasons.”00:03:14What you need to know about the 'extreme' heatwave hitting our oceans – video explainerThe best way to avoid having to take these measures is to keep the world to the 1.5C of heating pledge made in Paris in 2015, but the chances of this are vanishing as countries burn through more fossil fuels. If this does not happen, northern European countries that do not have cooling measures in place can expect large-scale disruption.The co-lead author Dr Nicole Miranda added: “Northern European countries will require large-scale adaptation to heat resilience quicker than other countries. Extreme heat can lead to dehydration, heat exhaustion and even death, especially in vulnerable populations. It’s a health and economic imperative that we prepare for more hot days.”Top 10 countries by relative cooling change1 Switzerland 30%2 United Kingdom 30%skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The name Spathaspora domphillipsii sp nov is proposed for this novel species.”The paper was authored by 11 microbiologists working jointly from three universities in Minas Gerais state, Tocantins state, and Western Ontario, Canada.Phillips and Pereira were murdered in June last year while they were travelling down a river in the Javari Valley, near Brazil’s border with Peru.Phillips, a former freelancer for the Guardian and the Washington Post, was working on a book about sustainable development in the Amazon and Pereira, a longtime advocate for indigenous rights, was with him as a guide and local activist.Four men are in jail accused of ordering or participating in the crime.Phillips and Pereira join a long list of famous people to have plants or animals named after them. Thousands of new species are identified every year and those who discover them often give them novel names.Beyoncé was given the honour after the discovery of an Australian horsefly; a blood-sucking crustacean parasite was christened Gnathia marleyi in tribute to reggae star Bob Marley; and a beetle was named after environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg in 2019.In 2001, scientists named a species of mushroom Spongiforma squarepantsii after the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants."

The fire, which initially broke out in Dervenochoria, about 18 miles (30km) north of the Greek capital, had ripped through land turned tinder dry by temperatures that surpassed 40C (104F) last week.By late Tuesday a fire front stretching for more than five miles had spurred mass evacuations and decimated homes, cars, olive groves and pine forests in the area of Mandra, where police could be seen helping panic-stricken residents get into vehicles as the flames approached. “We are living a nightmare,” the mayor of Mandra, Christos Stathis, told Open TV. “Houses and properties are on fire.”View image in fullscreenFirefighter tackling a wildfire in Greece on Wednesday. Photograph: Orestis Panagiotou/EPAIn dramatic scenes overnight, firefighting forces had battled to stop flames reaching a coastal complex of oil refineries close to Corinth, with Skai TV reporting the blaze had come within 500 metres (1,600ft) of the installation. “Last night men and women in civil protection [forces] and all the state machinery made a superhuman effort,” said the climate crisis and civil protection minister, Vassilis Kikilias. “The efforts will continue because climatic conditions are expected to be difficult today.”Fires were on Wednesday reported to have come “within a breath” of homes in Megara, with Greek media describing a 4km front of flames on the periphery of the 30,000-strong town. Constantly shifting winds made the work of firefighters that much harder. “We evacuated the area in time,” said Megara’s mayor, Grigorios Stamoulis, appealing for more aircraft to be dispatched to the area. “Aerial means are the only ones that can act and bring about a decisive result. Ground forces can’t stop the fire in the forest.”00:03:10What is supercharging the global heat? – video explainerAuthorities said firefighters were also battling flare-ups in the region of Loutraki, where at least 32 homes were burned to the ground and a state of emergency was declared on Tuesday, while fires were also reported on the islands of Rhodes and Crete. On order of the fire brigade three villages were evacuated on Rhodes because the blazes were deemed to be out of control. “Conditions are extreme and are likely to remain so for another week,” Kostas Tsigas, who heads the fire brigade officers’ association, told Skai TV.View image in fullscreenA man inspects fire damage in Dervenochoria, Greece. Photograph: Orestis Panagiotou/EPAIn a week that has highlighted the realities of the climate emergency, thousands have been forced to flee homes as a result of the forest fires and countless others have lost properties they have worked a lifetime to acquire. On Monday, as Etesian winds blew in after a four-day heatwave, fires had ripped through seaside towns south-east of Athens, gutting holiday homes and leaving a trail of disaster in their wake.“We have always had wildfires and we always will,” said the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, cutting short a visit to Brussels to return to Athens, where he held emergency talks with Kikilias on Wednesday. “But with the effects of the climate crisis, we are experiencing fires with increasing intensity.”Greece is poised for a second heatwave once winds drop on Thursday. Temperatures are forecast to reach 44C over the weekend, with Greek meteorologists saying the worst is yet to come. “Although the winds will recede from tomorrow [Thursday] this doesn’t mean that the danger of fires will lessen,” the forecaster Theodoros Yiannaros told state-run TV. “There will be a drop in danger perhaps tomorrow but during the weekend the risk will be very high … difficult times are ahead of us.”Greek culture ministry officials told the Guardian it was “likely” the Acropolis in Athens would once again be closed to the public if temperatures were deemed dangerously high."

In March, millions of bony herring, which boomed during the floods, died in a fish kill that dwarfed the events of 2019.Menindee local Ross Files, who was born in the town in 1939, said fish kills were not regular events.“We never had a fish kill in the river until they started growing cotton in the catchment up north. It never happened,” he said.Regulated part of Darling-Baaka River and site of mass fish killThe March fish kill is still being investigated by the chief scientist, but a possible cause could be that the millions of new bony herring that spawned during the floods became trapped at the upper weir and consumed all the oxygen in the water.The office of the NSW chief scientist has also been asked to investigate longer-term issues around management of the river system and future emergency responses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Rural NetworkFree newsletterSubscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is the reality facing its 12,000 inhabitants who live in the shadow of possible climate change extinction, mostly as a result of rising sea levels.\nA child’s teddy bear is part of the debris washed up along Tuvalu’s coastline\nFor six days each week, heavy machinery operated by local workers moves large piles of sand around in an effort to reclaim land and prevent the flooding and destruction that comes with king tides.

Church halls are filled with the sounds of voices singing in harmony with the distinct rhythm and tone that can be found across the Pacific.After the service, families spill out into the streets wearing their Sunday best, brightly coloured outfits patterned with flowers, while women and men alike wear a fou – a wreath of tropical flowers worn on the head.\nPeople gather at a community hall to enjoy a feast with other church members\nThe Sunday feast is a meal which has had to evolve over the years as climate change affects the quality of the soil and king tides wipe away ground crops, making fresh local produce harder and harder to grow. Tinned meat and packet noodles are mixed into the more traditional fare of cooked green bananas and taro in coconut cream and freshly caught fish.The day moves to Tuvalu’s own rhythm, slowly and calmly, but with purpose. After the feasting, children move outdoors to play, teenagers use their phones to sing songs karaoke-style, while adults find quiet spots under trees or in the corner of the community hall to let their food digest until the next part of the programme begins.When the time is right, the adults gather in circles and play a drum that wakes the sleeping from their rest. The women swap their church outfits for T-shirts and sarongs, and move in unison to the drum beat, dancing faster and faster until they can’t keep up and laughter erupts.

But images from the far west New South Wales town show a number of endangered, slow-growing Murray cod have also died.The NSW Department of Primary Industries told Guardian Australia it had received reports of further fish death events within the lower Darling-Baaka river at the weekend, including near Karoola and below Menindee main weir.“DPI understands that fish death events are distressing to the local community,” a department spokesperson said.“It is estimated that thousands of fish, predominantly carp and bony herring have been affected, with increasing numbers of Murray cod and golden perch also impacted.”Dead fish, both invasive carp and native, at the Menindee town boat ramp on 27 February. Photograph: Geoff Looney/The GuardianIt comes after thousands of carp were reported dead at the main weir last week. River ecologist Prof Fran Sheldon warned of a “domino effect” on water quality as the volume of dead fish cause dissolved oxygen levels to decrease, putting more fish, including native species, at risk.Menindee photographer Geoff Looney said he has seen hundreds of dead fish floating down the lower Darling River through the town, piling up at the boat ramp and among fallen trees.“The dead fish now are in the town everywhere,” he said. “As you stand on the bridge, with the current coming from Lake Pamamaroo, the dead fish are floating past you.”According to the latest water quality update supplied to Guardian Australia by the NSW Department of Planning and Environment, the dissolved oxygen levels for the lower Darling River at the town of Menindee was 1.58mg/L on 22 February. Native fish and other large aquatic organisms require at least 2 mg/L to survive.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nMenindee mass fish kill: thousands of carp dead amid water quality fearsRead moreThe president of the Darling River Action Group, Ross Leddra, said fish are dying all along the river from Menindee to at least 40km downstream at Bindara Station. The managers of the historic homestead reported also seeing dead fish, including metre-long Murray Cod, in the Darling River at Bindara.The DPI said the fish deaths are likely related to continued low dissolved oxygen levels.“This appears to be driven by increased biomass in the system as flood waters recede, with high levels of nutrients draining back into the river channel in recent weeks,” a DPI spokesperson said.“The increased number of fish, bacteria and algae in the system can result in depletion of oxygen levels. The current hot weather in the region is also exacerbating the situation.”Looney has been documenting the fish death event, taking photos at various locations around Menindee. Last week he found just one dead Murray cod; this week there were at least a dozen.Photos taken at Railway Bridge in Menindee, near the Menindee Pumping Station, showing two large dead native fish. Photograph: Geoff Looney/The GuardianHe said some of the dead fish were piling up near the pumping station for the town’s water supply, and the town deserved greater transparency about their water quality.Leddra said water quality was a concern for local residents.“It’s not taken as seriously as it should [be], especially for the communities which live along the Darling River,” he said.DPI said it was working with Water NSW to improve the quality of water released through the Menindee town pool and downstream of the Menindee Lakes system. It said it would undertake sampling of the fish population, between Weir 32 and Menindee Main Weir, once flooding recedes.\nTo report areas in NSW where fish may be struggling or a fish death event has occurred, call the NSW Fisheries hotline on 1800 043 536\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community\n"

        "text": "Leila Taheri’s article is interesting, and she is right, up to a point (I lead a litter-picking group, but I will always defend litterers. This is why, 3 April). There is certainly far too much single-use rubbish created, and manufacturers should be incentivised to produce less. Since they are motivated to seek the cheapest option (eg disposable versus returnable bottles), it is up to the government to create economic rules that favour “reduce, reuse, recycle”.It should also review how disposal is funded. Costs are incurred when following the proper disposal route, and these can be considerable. This provides an incentive to fly-tip, and discourages the provision of bins (the owner/operator has to pay).Litter clearing is the other side of the coin. Public bodies, both local and national, need to give greater priority to this – look at the state of roadsides. The money for this has to come from somewhere and, in principle, should be raised when items are made and sold.Where I disagree with the author is in exculpating litterers. The decision to drop litter, whatever one’s circumstances, is a personal choice; littering is not confined to those who are hard-up. The common characteristic of wilful litterers, rich or poor, is selfishness – “my convenience, grievance or whatever is all that matters”. However, I agree that merely ranting against litter is unproductive, and if one doesn’t like to see it, then one should get out there and help pick it up (I do). More power to Taheri for doing that.Peter JanesWest Harptree, Somerset I read with interest Leila Taheri’s article about how much to blame those who litter. I help local litter volunteers and the amount of rubbish chucked out of car windows into the hedges and verges along my local lane is truly atrocious. The vast majority of the rubbish is made up of discarded glass and plastic bottles, and aluminium cans.When I lived in Germany, I never saw this kind of litter anywhere, and there was a good, simple reason. Germany has had an excellent deposit return scheme (DRS) and recycling system for over 25 years. All supermarkets have machines that take glass and plastic bottles and aluminium cans in return for a voucher that you redeem at the till. Even if somebody throws one of these items into a hedge, it wouldn’t be there for long because every kid knows it’s worth 25 cents.Environmental groups in Britain campaigned hard for two decades for something similar here, but the current government dragged its feet because it is in the pocket of the big drinks companies and supermarkets. In 2019, it finally announced that a DRS would go ahead; it then took two years for a consultation, then another two years to hear the outcome. Now, we hear that it won’t be introduced until after the next election – and it won’t even include glass bottles.All those who voted for the present government should admit their share of blame for the dismal state of our country.Edmund WoodGillingham, Dorset I organise our village litter pick and we are invariably disheartened by the amount of rubbish we find and do get angry about it, so when I read Leila Taheri’s article, I thought it was the Guardian’s April fool’s joke two days late. So when I see a delivery bloke chucking his can out of his van window I shouldn’t think him a lazy, inconsiderate slob, he is just feeling “alienated, disconnected and excluded”.Colin McRae Great Dunmow, Essex Leila Taheri’s article was infuriating. How patronising to suggest that people shouldn’t be expected to use a bin because of “society”. Litterers disgrace themselves and this planet, and they are a very, very long way down my list of people to feel sorry for.

        "text": "Almost two decades ago, Uruguay led the way as the world’s first country to enshrine the right to clean water in its constitution. Now it is parched and desperate. Residents can cross the reservoir serving Montevideo on foot. The capital has declared a water emergency, with officials warning that it is a matter of days before it runs dry. For months they have been eking out tap water supplies by adding brackish estuary water, telling pregnant women and people with serious health conditions not to drink it. Authorities have cut taxes on bottled water and are distributing it for free to the estimated one in seven people for whom it is unaffordable. Others are turning to wells.The main culprit is the worst drought in more than 70 years. Though Uruguay is naturally rich in water, rainfall is highly variable due to the impact of La Niña and El Niño weather patterns. The problems are exacerbated by global heating, which makes dry years drier and rainy years wetter, as well as increasing evaporation losses. Neighbouring Argentina is beset by shortages already. Many more countries around the world face similar challenges – or soon will.Climatic factors are only one part of this problem. Researchers and campaigners have been warning for years that the growing impact of export-led agriculture and forestry was unsustainable. Only a small proportion of Uruguay’s water is used for human consumption. In 2019, rice, wood pulp, soy beans and meat – the main exports – used more than 50 times as much as went to drinking supplies. There is also anger about the construction of a new Google data centre, which critics say will use millions of litres of water a day, though officials say that the plans have been revised.Experts say that 2004’s constitutional changes led to major improvements in what had been a hierarchical and fragmented water management system. But integration in planning has not been matched in implementation. Successive governments have failed to adequately invest in maintaining and overhauling infrastructure, perhaps in part because in previous droughts, rain arrived just as matters were getting really desperate: “We all fell asleep,” admitted José Mujica, president from 2010 to 2015. But opposition from big business, as well as complacency, has played a significant role in the failure to establish a satisfactory long-term strategy.That will have to change if the country is to find lasting solutions. There is reason to be optimistic. The 2004 constitutional reforms, approved by more than 60% of the population in a referendum, also enshrined public management of water supplies, and were motivated in large part by the privatisation of drinking water and sanitation services. A coalition of civil society and political groups, the National Commission for the Defence of Water and Life, identified profit-driven water management and greed as a fundamental threat to the basic rights of citizens. This was a grassroots initiative that succeeded in the face of indifference from political leaders and the media – and outright opposition from business interests.In a country that has been ranked as the most democratic in the Americas, civil society could play an essential role in finding solutions again. The importance of access to clean water is a top priority for the public once more. Uruguay’s crisis today is the future for more and more nations. They could learn a lot by looking to its past."

        "text": "There comes a time in a plant’s life when the head sags, the leaves go pale and the body releases a barrage of sounds that are the ultrasonic equivalent of stamping on bubble wrap.While any gardener is familiar with the wilting and discoloration that comes with drought, a shortage of water or a sudden wound can also prompt plants to produce staccato pops, which nearby creatures may respond to, scientists say.The discovery, described as “exciting and thought-provoking” by one independent expert, suggests the plant kingdom is not as silent as it seems, and that ultrasonic sounds emitted from plants might even help shape their ecosystems.“When these plants are in good shape, they produce less than one sound per hour, but when stressed they emit many more, sometimes 30 to 50 per hour,” said Prof Lilach Hadany, an evolutionary biologist and theoretician at Tel Aviv University.“They are potentially important because other organisms could have evolved to hear these sounds and interpret them,” she added. “We are now testing both animals and plants to see if they respond.”Hadany and her colleagues recorded sounds produced by tomato and tobacco plants raised in greenhouses. Healthy plants emitted clicks and pops, but the sounds came in far more rapid bursts when the plants were deprived of water or had their stems cut. The noises could be picked up 3-5 metres away.If plants are so intelligent, should we stop eating them? | Emma BeddingtonRead moreAt 40 to 80kHz, the sounds are too high-pitched for the human ear, which has an upper range of about 20kHz. But insects such as moths and small mammals including mice can detect such frequencies, raising the prospect that the noises might influence their behaviour.Writing in Cell, the scientists describe how the plants’ sounds are as loud as human speech and are emitted more frequently after two days without water. The pops peak at day five or six and then subside as the plant dries up.On recording the sounds, the researchers trained an artificial intelligence algorithm to identify the plant and the cause of its stress from the popping noise alone. It was not 100% accurate, but demonstrates that the sounds contain information that might be useful to organisms in the environment, they say.There is no evidence the sounds are an attempt to communicate, any more than a log declares distress by crackling on a fire. But Hadany said the sounds might nonetheless be useful for nearby creatures, perhaps affecting which plants animals feed on or where insects lay their eggs. It is unclear what creates the sounds, but the authors suspect a process called cavitation, where water columns in dehydrated plant stems break down, generating air bubbles.Whether or not anything is listening to the sounds, Hadany says the discovery could make irrigation more efficient by using microphones alongside other sensors to detect when plants are short on water.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he is sceptical that they would respond to quieter sounds in a noisy natural environment. “It seems much more probable that if such communication exists, it is carried out through the emission of volatile substances,” he said.“The fact that a plant emits sounds does not mean that it is communicating with its congeners,” he added. “Any system of pipes that transports a fluid generates sounds and that does not mean that a water pipe is trying to communicate with anyone.”"

This huge, alien-looking cephalopod had attracted many visitors to the small marine reserve at Sydney’s Manly beach; they were enthralled by his flashing rainbow colours and flamboyant tentacles.He measured about 1 metre in length, and he did not mind posing for an underwater camera, or 10. There were sometimes other smaller cuttlefish around, but none of his size or vibrancy. His image is all over Instagram and he even featured in the pic of the week competition of a national news site. Mr Fabulous was a legend.A sea snake: like a nightmare generated by a sleep app | Helen SullivanRead moreUnfortunately, the good life didn’t last, and he was found dead this month. His headless corpse appeared to have been attacked by another ocean animal. Dolphins were seen in the vicinity, and they are known to prey on giant cuttlefish. There has been much sadness on social media and there is no doubt that this underwater creature has been a muse, a delight and an inspiration. He’s also been community glue, catalysing friendships (“Did you see him?”), ocean conservation efforts and joint purpose.The giant cuttlefish, native to Australia, is the world’s largest variety of cuttlefish. Divers can find them all year round in Sydney but most of the time they are quiet and camouflaged. As winter approaches, breeding time is upon us. The males give their chromatophores a workout and put on a dazzling disco of coloured displays to attract females. Sometimes they even pretend to be females, so they can look less threatening and wait until a quiet moment to take their chances with the actual females. As far as underwater sights go, nothing beats watching two males compete for a female – colour, movement and living art. They are short-lived creatures, like their cousin the octopus. They usually only live for one or two years and may only have one breeding season to establish a genetic lineage.The winter cuttlefish season is eagerly anticipated in Sydney and the first sighting is always met with excitement. Location details are shared and photos enjoyed. It’s a reason to talk to people and to jump into the cold ocean water. I’ve had the pleasure of being with people as they’ve had their first cuttlefish experience and it is always memorable and thrilling. Wildlife has intrinsic worth but it also markedly enhances human lives.Octopus farming turns my stomach – but are some species really more worthy than others? | Elle HuntRead moreThis large male cuttlefish is just one example of a charismatic species who has captured a community. Stumpy the smooth stingray at Western Australia’s Hamelin Bay was the friendliest ray in the bay, allowing himself to be stroked by children. Stumpy had no tail so posed no risk to humans. But Stumpy was killed by fishers in front of local children. At that time only empathy prevented smooth stingrays from being taken by spear or line. His death and the uproar that followed inspired significant new marine conservation laws which protect black and smooth stingrays along the West Australian coast. Once a wild animal attains a name and a following, it’s easier to recognise its individual worth.For our cuttlefish friend Mr Fabulous, we will now grieve gently, recognising the old adage that “nature is red in tooth and claw” and hoping that he had a chance to pass on his spectacular genes earlier in the breeding season. We will start looking for new cuttlefish, and enjoy their unique beauty and vibrance. We will benefit from human relationships forged over animal sightings and precious images. We will understand that being able to spend time with animals prompts us to care about them and their habitats. And we will remember again how much animals and wildlife enhance human lives, just by allowing us to be a part of theirs.

During last winter’s energy squeeze, prices averaged about $320/MWh.For the June quarter, Queensland and South Australia’s wholesale prices averaged about $140/MWh, and Victoria’s just under $100, while Tasmania’s were cheapest at $65.Peter Dutton ‘the alternative PM from the alt-right’ heading Coalition’s ‘cabal of climate denial’, Chris Bowen claimsRead moreDuring the period, AGL closed the final units of its Liddell coal-fired power station in NSW’s Hunter valley, contributing to the uptick in prices for the quarter, the AER said.Still, supply conditions were not as tight as a year ago when delayed maintenance at ageing coal-fired power stations combined with an extended cold weather snap, which pushed up energy demand. Wind energy was also lower than expected.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n“We have seen far fewer coal generator outages and more coal capacity offered into the market than the same period last year,” said Justin Oliver, an AER board member. “There are strong gas flows between states and high gas storage levels at [Victoria’s] Iona facility, which is critical for managing supply-demand shocks.”The pickup in wholesale prices were reflected in the updated default retail power prices offered across the eastern states.

        "text": "I love making food gifts – jam, biscuits, chocolates and the like – but how can I wrap them sustainably?Emily, Stroud“We love this time of year, but packaging waste does rear its ugly head,” say Anshu Ahuja and Renee Williams, the duo behind DabbaDrop in London, a vegan takeaway that delivers by bike in eco packaging. And they’re not kidding: according to specialists Challenge Boxes & Packaging, “in the UK at Christmas time, we use a staggering 338,251 tonnes of cardboard packaging, 35,877 tonnes of plastic and 269,423 miles of wrapping paper”.So when it comes to homemade gifts, the thing to remember is that new isn’t always better. First, look at what you’ve already got around – bits of fabric or reusable cotton cloths, say, can easily be turned into wrapping, Ahuja and Williams say, and you can “have fun using different layers and colours”. Newspaper or sheets torn from your, ahem, favourite supplement will also see you right. “The joy of that is they’ll get a free recipe, too,” says Sadhbh Moore, co-author, with Abi Aspen Glencross, of Sustainable Kitchen. And if you’ve got any greaseproof paper to hand, twirl squares of the stuff around a tower of biscuits, for instance – “Much as you would with a bottle of wine,” Moore explains – for a good plastic-free alternative to clingfilm although, granted, that does come with a single-use issue.Alternatively, Moore suggests repurposing paper bags from pastry purchases, especially if they have “that plastic film in the middle”, which makes them ideal for homemade granola and biscuits, “so you can see what’s going on”. The same goes for those tea boxes with windows; Moore then “collages over the branding” (although that does take a bit more effort). If you are having a Blue Peter moment, however (or are looking to keep children entertained), Moore suggests making an origami box: “I’ve done this with children at the Story Garden in King’s Cross, where we made gyoza and then made origami boxes to take them home in.” This strategy could also be applied to homemade chocolates, Moore says, “using newspaper, old sugar paper, card or paper for the boxes – no Sellotape, no plastic”.If your budget allows, avoid the pile-up altogether by “making the packaging part of the gift”, suggest Ahuja and Williams, whose reusable dabbas are “versatile and make a wonderful present”. The likes of chutney, jam and homemade booze (“Foraged sloe gin or walnut liqueur are fun to make,” the pair say) should go into reused jars and bottles – just be sure to sterilise them first. And if you’re worried about flavour contamination (when reusing an empty pickle jar for, say, jam or biscuits), Moore suggests “cutting a disc of greaseproof paper and using it as a barrier between the potentially pickley lid and the contents”.When it comes to securing your gifts, Ahuja and Williams swap tape (“It contains plastic”) for string, although you could wrap gifts with cloth instead (“It’s so simple to tie”). Then, to make things more festive, decorate “with foraged items such as leaves, dehydrated citrus, dried flowers, seed heads and herb sprigs”. A homemade tag wouldn’t go amiss, either: “Get the kids involved and have them illustrate tissue from any recent deliveries.” The very definition of Santa’s little helpers. Got a culinary dilemma?

They live inside a tube with a feathery red plume sticking out of one end and a clump of roots at the other.Deep-sea scientists first identified them in 2002, growing like a shaggy carpet on a whale skeleton they encountered by chance, nearly 3,000 metres deep in Monterey Bay, California. A deep-diving robot brought up samples which revealed these were not plants but worms that eat bones, now officially called Osedax – the bone-devourers in Latin.Q&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world’s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth – and how much there is to protect. Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Once scientists knew how to look for them, the search for bone-eating worms – also known as zombie worms – began in earnest. Teams dragged dead, beached whales offshore and sank them into the deep. Landing devices deliver parcels of animal bones to the seabed – pigs, cows, turkeys – then retrieve them months or years later to see what has infested them.“Basically, wherever we put bones, we find [the worms],” says Greg Rouse from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, San Diego, and one of the team who found and described Osedax.More than 30 species from around the world have so far been found. There’s the bone-eating snot flower, Osedax mucofloris, first found off Sweden. Osedax fenrisi was discovered near a hydrothermal vent at a depth of more than 2,000 metres in the Arctic, and named in 2020 after the Norse god Loki’s son, Fenris the wolf.The bone-eating worm ranges in size from the length of a little finger to smaller than an eyelash. Those visible to the naked eye are usually females. Males are mostly tiny and don’t eat bones. They live in “harems” of tens or hundreds inside a female’s mucous tube, and wait for her eggs to emerge so they can immediately fertilise them.All the energy these diminutive males get comes from their mothers via their egg yolks. Once they have run down that energy store, they die. “We called them kamikaze males,” says Robert Vrijenhoek, retired evolutionary biologist from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, California, who was also part of the original Osedax-finding team.The bone-eating snot flower, Osedax mucofloris, seen in the water with feathery tendrils coming from its head and a clump of roots at the other end. Photograph: The Natural History Museum/AlamyOne species, Osedax priapus, does things differently. Rouse and his colleagues named it after the ancient Greek fertility god, as depicted in erotic frescoes. These males are a similar size to the females and have a long, extensible trunk which they use to reach across the bone.“I call this roaming the bone,” says Rouse. When they find females, these males deliver sperm stored inside their head.Discovered in the deep: the mini cities of hairy-chested Hoff crabsRead moreTo feed, Osedax etch holes in bones by producing acid in the same way that humans produce stomach acid. Palaeontologists, in a quest to discover when Osedax worms evolved, have found telltale holes punched in the fossilised bones of a 100-million-year-old plesiosaur, one of the giant marine reptiles that once roamed the ocean.Genetic studies back up the theory that Osedax have been around since at least the Cretaceous period, long before there were whale skeletons around to feast on.Despite all the new species being found, nobody has yet tracked down any Osedax larvae. It’s not clear how the worms find bones. It is believed they may drift around until they locate a skeleton, perhaps guided by chemicals wafting through the water.Studies of Osedax DNA indicate that these worms live in huge, interconnected populations, possibly making stepping stones of whale skeletons and other large vertebrates stripped bare by scavengers. “Osedax probably just hop, skip and jump all the way across the ocean,” says Vrijenhoek."

        "text": "The prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to intensify attacks on green groups and exploit opposition to environmental protests could rebound badly for his party at the next general election, academics have warned.They argue that public support for achieving net zero emissions by 2050 in the UK is now entrenched and unlikely to be overturned. This view is backed by opinion polls, which show that 71% of the British public support moves that will lead to curtailment of the country’s fossil fuel emissions.“Sunak is largely performing for a pretty specific constituency within his own party,” said Prof Joe Smith, director of the Royal Geographical Society. “It is a weak tactic and the party will be punished for it because the demographics are clear. A large percentage of younger people of all political stripes are looking for purposeful action on climate change.”The climate war between government and environmentalists came to a head learlier this month when Greenpeace members draped Sunak’s North Yorkshire house in black fabric to protest against his plan to “max out” the UK’s North Sea oil and gas reserves by issuing a new round of licences for intensive drilling. Activists scheduled the demonstration for while Sunak and family were on holiday in California and the house was empty.Similar stunts in the past saw the homes of David Cameron and John Prescott targeted by campaigners. However, Conservative reaction was far more aggressive on this occasion. Ministers told civil servants to cease all engagements with the group, a decision that limits government officials’ ability to collaborate with environmentalists over issues such as deep-sea mining and marine protection zones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has since kept a constant commentary on the government’s environmental performance. There is absolutely no chance that any of the mainstream parties are going to walk away from that commitment. It is a really strong foundation for action.”The environment movement argues that the key issue is to make the most of that astonishingly powerful political commitment. “At the moment,” said Smith, “established green groups are looking a bit spooked by the very forthright behaviour of Extinction Rebellion and need to be more careful and focused about how they pursue their goals.“In any case, we should not be leaving the battle to reach net zero to the environmental movement. Researchers, business, the media and other cultural institutions should feel more ownership of the task of having a public conversation about how we build a better tomorrow.”The problem with giving publicity to Sunak’s anti-green rhetoric is that it suggests deep divisions over green issues in this country. Smith added: “I was profoundly pessimistic 30 years ago about the idea that we could win round a majority of the population to the idea that climate change was happening, was caused by humans and that action was badly needed. All of that has been achieved, however, and that is very encouraging.”"

Originally, this was to save on wastage and to boost nutrition, but I’ve now acquired a taste for it, not least because peeled apples often turn soft and mushy, like baby food. That said, apple scraps (cores, seeds and peelings) can be put to good use in vinegar and today’s pectin jelly, for example. Use the jelly to set low-pectin and low-sugar jams, or just spread it on toast.Apple pectin jelly (and an apple pie made with the leftover apples)As well as using the pectin to set jam made with low-pectin fruit such as raspberries and blueberries, this jelly is also great for sweetening gravies, and as a glaze for pork or game. It can be made from the whole apple, but it is the skin, seeds and core that hold the most pectin, which means that apple scraps make the best pectin jelly. Store scraps in the freezer until you have at least 500g, which is enough to make a small batch of jelly. This apple pie, meanwhile, is a great way to use up the rest of the fruit.Makes About 200ml apple pectin jelly and 1 large pieFor the pectin jelly500g apple scraps (cores, seeds and peelings from about 1.7kg baking apples)For the pie1.7kg baking apples, peeled, cored and cut into cubes150g raspberries1 tsp cinnamon2 tbsp spelt and emmer wheat flour, or fine wholewheat flour2 tbsp maple syrup, or unrefined sugarA pinch of sea saltFor the pastry3 tbsp ground flaxseed, mixed with 80ml cold water300g spelt and emmer wheat flour, or fine wholewheat flour3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil3 tbsp maple syrup, or unrefined sugarAquafaba, to glaze (optional)To make the pectin, put all the apple scraps in a pan, add enough water almost, but not quite, to cover the fruit, then bring to a simmer – do not stir. Leave to cook for two hours, then strain through fine muslin or a jelly bag overnight, resisting the urge to press the pulp. Pour the resulting jelly juices into a pan, reduce by half, then store in the fridge and use to make jam within a week.To make the pie toss the cubed apples with the raspberries, cinnamon, flour, maple syrup and salt, then tipinto a 30cm pie dish.To make the pastry, stir the flaxseed and water into the flour, then add the salt, oil and maple syrup and knead until it comes together into a dough. Roll out into a disc large enough to cover the pie dish, lay it on top and crimp; if you like, glaze the top with aquafaba.

        "text": "Similar numbers of female and male green and hawksbill turtles are hatching in the Coral Sea’s Conflict Islands, new research suggests, despite global heating increasingly leading to “extreme feminisation” of sea turtles.Sea turtles are particularly susceptible to the effects of global heating because their sex determination is temperature dependent, with the proportion of female hatchlings increasing when nests are warmer.Small island nations take high-emitting countries to court to protect the oceanRead moreAnalysing two islands within Papua New Guinea’s Conflict Group, researchers estimated that between 1960 and 2019, an average of 46.2% of turtle hatchlings have been female – a finding scientists welcomed but described in the study as “likely rare in the global context”. Over the same period, sand temperatures have increased by about 0.6C.In stark contrast, 2018 research found that at a similar latitude, on Raine Island in the northern Great Barrier Reef – the largest green turtle rookery in the world – warm nest temperatures had resulted in more than 99% of hatchlings being female.“It’s likely that a male-producing site like the Conflict Islands is going to be critical to survival of the future nesting populations within the Coral Sea,” said Melissa Staines, the study’s first author and a PhD student at the University of Queensland.Research has found that warming seas will probably threaten sea turtle survival even if the reptiles lay their eggs at cooler times of year to adapt to global heating. Photograph: Migration Media/WWFStaines said that the proportion of female hatchlings had increased in recent years but it was likely that sites with balanced sex ratios were rare.The researchers believe the discrepancy in turtle sex ratios between the Conflict Islands and Raine Island – which are about 850km apart in the Coral Sea – is likely because the island group has high rainfall and abundant shade, whereas Raine Island has no trees.“All of the islands within the [Conflict Islands] atoll are heavily shaded by tropical rainforests, pandanus palms and coconut palm trees,” Staines said. “Providing full shade throughout the day across most of the islands can really significantly keep that temperature nice and cool.”The study, published in the journal Global Change Biology, also suggests the islands “will also be moderately safe guarded against extreme feminisation in future decades”, but projects that over the next 80 years 76% to 87% of future hatchlings may be female on average.00:01:25Scientists record world's largest hatching of baby turtles in South America – video“Female dominance in the next 80 years may still be quite adequate for that population,” said Christine Madden Hof, the global marine turtle conservation lead at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and a co-author of the paper.“Climate change isn’t impacting this population at a threatening stage right now. We need to keep a mindful and a watchful eye on it, and it may need intervention in the future.”The Conflict Islands study is part of a wider Asia Pacific-wide project focusing on how temperatures impact turtle populations. The team also has temperature gauges deployed in Malaysia, the Philippines, Vanuatu, Tonga and New Caledonia.I have studied emperor penguins for 30 years. We may witness their demise in our lifetime |  Barbara WieneckeRead more“It is really important to be able to identify where those male-producing populations are, because these are the ones that might really sustain some of our more regionally based populations,” Madden Hof said.WWF-led research on a turtle nest cooling project has found that one-off applications of seawater can temporarily cool nests by 2C to yield more male hatchlings.In research published last month in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series, scientists found that applying different volumes of seawater in tests on Heron Island increased the proportions of male hatchlings between two- and fivefold.Some seawater applications resulted in a small decrease in hatchling success, but at rates that “didn’t raise significant concern for us as scientists”, Madden Hof said.Previous research has found that warming seas will probably threaten sea turtle survival even if the reptiles lay their eggs at cooler times of year to adapt to global heating.Of the seven living marine turtle species, two are listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list as critically endangered, one is endangered, and two are considered vulnerable."

        "text": "The Swedish prosecutor investigating the Nord Stream sabotage attack has said the “clear main scenario” was that a state-sponsored group had been involved, seemingly casting doubt over theories that posited an independent group was responsible for the pipeline blasts.Mats Ljungqvist told Reuters on Thursday that though a non-state-backed plot was still theoretically possible, the type of explosive used in the bombings ruled out a “large portion of actors”.According to a UN report, the three underwater explosions that ruptured the gas link between Russia and Germany north-east and south-east of the Baltic Sea island of Bornholm on 26 September 2022 were equivalent to the power of several hundred kilograms of explosives.Swedish investigators have found traces of explosives on several of the objects they examined but the type used has not yet been named. Analysts have estimated them to have been powered by the equivalent of 400-500kg of TNT, or 300-350kg of Semtex, a general-purpose plastic explosive used in commercial blasting.Officials believe pro-Ukraine group may have sabotaged Nord Stream – reportsRead moreGöran Swistek, a security specialist at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said: “That is a huge amount of explosives and not something you could pilfer from a building site or something that a trader on the black market would have sitting in their garage.”The destruction of three of the four Nord Stream pipelines, which had stopped transporting gas at the point of the blasts, has been the subject of intense speculation, with some theories zeroing on a Nato Baltops 22 wargame two months before, and others on a Greek-flagged tanker shipping Russian oil that had drifted near the pipeline for several days.The prosecutor dismissed some of these theories as politically motivated. “The incident has obviously become an open arena for different influence attempts,” Ljungqvist said.“These speculations do not have an impact on the ongoing investigation, which is grounded in facts and the information which has emerged from analyses, crime scene investigations and collaboration with authorities in Sweden and other countries.”One theory, put forward in reports published in the New York Times and the German weekly Die Zeit, suggested the attack could have been carried out by a group of six people with pro-Ukrainian affiliation, but not necessarily sponsored by the state, using a German yacht chartered by a Polish company.Swistek said the prosecutor’s comments suggested investigators shared his scepticism that a 15-metre yacht would have sufficed to carry out the sabotage attack.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Dear winter,It seems that you intend to visit us again this year. I just want to make it clear \u2013 because researchers have found that expressing \u201cfeelings\u201d about you in the form of a \u201cdear winter\u201d letter could make me less miserable at this time of year \u2013 that I did not invite you.Don\u2019t take it personally, but I am sure not many other people are keen on your arrival either, apart from heat pump marketers and pantomime performers. The thing is, winter, 2 million people in the UK experience seasonal affective disorder \u2013 and it\u2019s all your fault.I didn\u2019t always have a problem with you. As a child in Scotland, I remember the sense of exhilaration and excitement at the prospect of frozen lochs, blizzards and the hope that school might be closed. This was only enhanced by the fact that my father, who was born and brought up in Calcutta, now Kolkata, had never seen snow until he was 25 and greeted every fresh dusting with wonder.But that was then. Now, I see you coming each year, perfumed with bonfire smoke and cinnamon-spiced apples, lulling me into a feeling of cosy optimism.\u201cOh, it\u2019s not so bad, this winter malarkey,\u201d I will tell myself. Now, I can enjoy flannel pyjamas, hot chocolate with marshmallows and watch three seasons of Lupin (because there is nothing more comforting than scaring yourself on a dead-of-winter night with a foreign crime thriller). Distracted by luxury Advent calendars stuffed with artisanal cheese and craft gin, I think you are my friend. Until, suddenly, it\u2019s January.Behold the true depths of your soul \u2013 dark, grinch-like, unrelenting, with a side order of guilt, bills and self-assessment tax forms. And you still have one more trick up your sleeve, don\u2019t you, winter? Every year, I think: if I can just get to the end of January, it will be spring. But, like an ultramarathon runner, you have the stamina to keep pace with the shivering gloom until the end of March.No wonder a team of researchers at the University of Glasgow (whose main building is often mistaken for that fictional wintery paradise Hogwarts) have written a guidebook to help people cope with the season. Light is a Right: A Guide to Wintering Well may not contain magic, but it does make some creative suggestions.As well as writing a letter to you \u2013 strangely, the book doesn\u2019t include your address \u2013 it suggests making a cardboard frame to look through and thus focus mindfully on one patch of sky at a time (who needs Netflix?). My favourite suggestion, because of its cinematic vibe, involves visualising a medieval room filled with light, stained glass and mirrors. \u201cThink surfaces, shiny things, mirrors, silver paper, glitter, [a] neon lamp, candles \u2026 papercuts on windows \u2026 Wish more of the outside world in, happier habits, cosy joys, enjoyable hobbies \u2026. Do the achievable and available, as opposed to the ideal and impossible.\u201dSimilar inspiration is to be found in Katherine May\u2019s excellent book Wintering, which became an unexpected bestseller during lockdown. She mentions that a surprising number of novels and fairytales have winter as a backdrop, but believes acceptance rather than fantasy is the way to maintain wellbeing until spring.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to avoid winter, so you might as well embrace it,\u201d she advises. \u201cI know people who hate it so much they try not to do anything for the whole season. We can invest so much energy in flinching away from things we find unpleasant or don\u2019t want to happen, but acceptance and stepping towards them lessens the pain.\u201dI think she may be suggesting that I offer you an olive branch, dear winter. How might I do that? The Glasgow research closes with a line from the Edwin Morgan poem Grey, which urges us to see some good in the gloom. \u201cThis moment, this day, so grey, so plain, so pleasing in its way!\u201d It\u2019s a big ask, to try to embrace life with only an occasional burst of sunshine. But I will let you in on a secret. The simple act of writing this letter has made me feel a lot less gloomy about the prospect of your arrival.Yours sincerely,Anita Anita Chaudhuri is a freelance journalist and photographer",

        "text": "An official behind the controversial felling of 110 trees by Plymouth council has said their removal will be \u201creally good for the city\u201d.Giles Perritt, the council\u2019s assistant chief executive, was speaking after campaigners got a high court order to extend an injunction to stop future felling.The trees have been chopped down in Plymouth city centre as part of a programme of redevelopment to the area that includes a 1980s shopping precinct. A council consultation found respondents overwhelmingly objected to it. More than 16,000 people signed a petition against the work.On Friday activists got an existing injunction against more trees being cut down extended. They have accused the council of trying to avoid scrutiny of the works.Perritt told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme it would bring benefits. \u201cChange is difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are really anxious to work with people who are unhappy with what we\u2019re doing and make sure we deliver a fabulous result for the city centre. [It] will be really good for Plymouth in the short and medium term.\u201dThe trees were removed shortly after the Conservative leader of Plymouth council, Richard Bingley, had signed an executive decision to cut them down for the \u00a312m scheme. Council workers shut off the site, chopping down the trees under the cover of darkness. Campaigners then hastily obtained an injunction to stop further felling.Bingley said he planned to step down on Monday as leader of the Conservative group and head of the authority. He told the Plymouth Herald: \u201cI\u2019ve always said I\u2019m not a full-time politician, I don\u2019t seek to be. I\u2019m just an individual who is passionate and ambitious for Plymouth. If others feel they can run our glorious Ocean City better, then that\u2019s great with me. Over to you, I say.\u201dBingley faced a no confidence vote over the trees.The row mirrors disputes over trees in other cities across the UK. The leader of Sheffield city council was criticised in an independent review earlier in March over thousands of street trees being cut down between 2013 and 2018, which led to protests. In one episode in 2016, council contractors dragged residents out of bed to move their cars at 4.45am so work could begin. The report criticised Sheffield city council for being \u201cdishonest\u201d.Presiding over the latest injunction hearing on Friday, the high court judge Sir Ross Cranston said: \u201cThe injunction will continue, the remaining trees cannot be felled at least for the time being.\u201dHe said there was a \u201cserious issue to be tried\u201d over the lawfulness of the council\u2019s decision.Alison White, who founded the campaign group Save the Trees of Armada Way, said on Friday: \u201cThe decision to completely destroy our urban forest against overwhelming public opposition in a way that avoided public scrutiny is indefensible.\u201d",

        "text": "Are the impacts from air pollution hiding in plain sight in the everyday aliments that so many of us suffer from? A new study, the largest of its kind, found that people living in polluted areas were more likely to have more than one long-term illness. Researchers looked at more than 360,000 people aged between 40 and 69 who had health data in the UK Biobank. They found greater chances of multiple neurological, respiratory, cardiovascular and common mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety, even having allowed for differences in income. These long-term problems affect people\u2019s lives and place big burdens on our economy and health services.Earlier this month the UK government announced a target for the worst particle pollution in England in 2040. It means that England plans to meet the 2005 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in 18 years\u2019 time, 35 years after the guidelines were set. The new health study found an extra 20% chance of multiple long-term illnesses for those living with particle pollution that is worse than the 2040 England target.Dr Ioannis Bakolis, from King\u2019s College London, who led the study, said: \u201cWe will need to track people\u2019s changing health over time to know for sure if air pollution caused these chronic health problems. If air pollution exposure indeed affects risk, it presents an opportunity to shape the epidemic of multiple long-term illness using environmental policy such as expanding low-emission zones or avoiding building care homes in pollution hotspots.\u201dIt may be decades before we get data on the progress of these chronic illnesses, but we can learn by looking into the past. Seventy years ago, London was coping with the deaths of about 12,000 people in the city\u2019s worst ever smog. A subsequent Ministry of Health report reviewed past death records and found that smogs had been killing people over the previous 80 years. The evidence had been there all along.In 2016, a study looked at the health of Londoners who survived the 1952 smog as infants under one year old or in utero. They were left with a 20% greater chance of developing asthma in childhood, compared with those outside London. Although less clear in the data, the chances of them having adult asthma increased by about 10%.Recent analysis of first world war army records found that air pollution had been reducing the height and health of soldiers who grew up downwind of areas of intense coal use.This all adds to the evidence that air pollution can lead to a whole range of chronic illness. Putting this another way, the benefits of clean air could be even greater than we imagine.",

In an email to companies, the EA said: \u201cFollowing careful consideration the Environment Agency has decided to discontinue the current procurement of a new property flood resilience (PFR) framework that was commenced earlier this year.\u201cWe have written directly to the suppliers who have submitted bids to advise them of this decision and the grounds for this decision.\u201dEngland\u2019s automated flood alerts to be permanent despite inaccuracy warningsRead moreThe EA said they were pulling the scheme because they had not received enough competent tenders to provide value for money. But Simon Crowther, who runs one of the companies that bid for the work, said the EA had made the process so complicated and costly it had put people off bidding.Crowther, a civil engineer and chartered water and environmental manager, said his company had spent tens of thousands of pounds over the past six weeks preparing its bid. He said the failure of the agency would impact on climate emergency resilience, and leave an increased number of communities exposed to flooding.\u201cI feel I have to speak out about this. The actions of the Environment Agency will delay the protection of thousands of homes. Flood victims do not have a voice and they will not know that these protections were coming or that they are now being delayed because of the actions of the EA. So I feel I need to raise awareness about this failure.\u201dCrowther, whose firm bid to carry out surveys of homes in the north-east, the Midlands, London and Kent as part of the scheme, said the timetable provided to the company showed the protections for homes could have been in place by the autumn. \u201cThat will now all be delayed,\u201d he said.Mary Dhonau OBE, who was awarded an OBE for work on reducing flood risk, said the companies bidding for the work were all small businesses who had spent thousands preparing their bids.She said: \u201cI know all those who tendered were proud with the high standard of the tenders they submitted. The Environment Agency has now discontinued the procurement process and intend to invite tenders for a new procurement shortly.\u201cThe property flood resilience industry is expected to go through the whole process again. I have explained the state of the marketplace. Over the last few days, I\u2019ve talked to quite a few companies. One of them has held a crisis meeting and wonder if it\u2019s worth staying in the PFR industry, another isn\u2019t going to bother again and is changing direction.

In its email to companies the agency said it still intended intention to go ahead with the flood defence project and would be in touch with those interested \u201cas soon as possible\u201d.The project was pulled by the EA as the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) revealed only a third of local authorities had enough staff to manage flash flood risks.CIWEM said more than 5m households are reported to be at risk from this form of flooding and surface water management in England was not consistently coordinated, or funded to manage future flood risks.An Environment Agency spokesperson said: \u201cThese claims are patently untrue. Not only is the Environment Agency continuing to work with partners to promote and deliver Property Flood Resilience solutions for many communities, we are also currently developing a new framework for suppliers which we aim to have awarded by the end of this year. As part of that process, we are focused on options to encourage more suppliers to submit bids, to drive competition and maximise value for money for the public.\u201d",

        "text": "Shell has misleadingly overstated how much it is spending on renewable energy and should be investigated and potentially fined by the US financial regulator, according to a non-profit group which has lodged a complaint against the oil giant.The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been urged to act over Shell\u2019s most recent annual report in which it stated 12% of its capital expenditure was funneled into a division called Renewables and Energy Solutions in 2021. The division\u2019s webpage, which is adorned with pictures of wind turbines and solar panels, says it is working to invest in \u201cwind, solar, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen, and more\u201d.Shell and BP face tough job of keeping customers and investors happy as profits roll inRead moreHowever, Global Witness, the activist group that has lodged the new complaint with the SEC, argues that just 1.5% of Shell\u2019s capital expenditure has been used to develop genuine renewables, such as wind and solar, with much of the rest of the division\u2019s resources devoted to gas, which is a fossil fuel.\u201cWhat Shell has said about the energy transition is not reflected in what they are doing,\u201d said Zorka Milin, senior adviser at Global Witness. \u201cThis business unit is fundamentally mislabeled, it has very little in the way of renewables and investors could be lulled into thinking Shell is doing far more on renewables than it is.\u201cThis is greenwashing. Gas, whatever it may be, is not renewable, it\u2019s part of the problem. I hope the SEC opens an investigation and imposes appropriate penalties to stop this greenwashing.\u201dShell does not have a full breakdown of its renewable energy activity in its annual reports but Global Witness said that by examining the document they could find $288m in wind and solar investment in 2021, which is equivalent to 1.5% of Shell\u2019s capital expenditure. Much of the spending by the Renewables and Energy Solutions division appears to be on the trading and marketing of gas.Should the SEC act over the issue, it will mark the most aggressive regulatory foray yet by the US federal government against a fossil fuel sector that is facing multiple lawsuits in several states for misleading investors and the public over what they knew about the climate crisis.Shell, which is headquartered in London but is listed on the New York stock exchange, has denied misleading investors. \u201cWe\u2019re confident Shell\u2019s financial disclosures are fully compliant with all SEC and other reporting requirements,\u201d said a company spokeswoman.The Shell spokeswoman said the company budgeted $20bn for \u201cenergy transition activities\u201d in 2022, which is a third of its total operational and capital expenditure spending. This investment went towards renewable energy, hydrogen fuels, capturing carbon at the source of pollution and research and development, she said.Most of the world\u2019s largest oil companies now accept that burning their product is causing global heating and have committed to the goals of the Paris climate agreement. But their shift away from fossil fuels has been ponderous \u2013 only about 5% of oil and gas company capital expenditure went to wind, solar and other renewables in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency. This was up from just 1% in 2019.Last year was a particularly lucrative one for oil companies\u2019 traditional business model, with soaring fossil fuel costs in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine prompting record profits for some of the wealthiest businesses in the world. Exxon made a record annual profit of nearly $56bn last year, while Chevron has reported a $36.5bn profit for 2022.Milin said she hoped the SEC, which is separately mulling new requirements for companies to disclose their greenhouse gases, would act to deter other oil companies. \u201cNo more will we allow big polluters to pull the wool over our eyes while the world burns,\u201d she said. The SEC did not respond to a request for comment.Bruce Huber, an expert in environmental law at Notre Dame University, said the new complaint highlights the external pressure that environmentalists are now placing upon fossil fuel companies.\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is climate activists poring over the disclosures of energy firms with a fine-tooth comb, looking for any misstatements that could be the basis for liability or penalty,\u201d he said.\u201cWhether these tactics will actually induce Shell or its competitors to decarbonize is unclear, but even if not, those firms won\u2019t be able to sneeze without someone looking for a securities violation.\u201d",

        "text": "The current strain of the avian influenza, which has been decimating bird populations globally, is perilously different than previous disease outbreaks, according to US researchers who are calling for urgent action.A new study led by a team from the University of Maryland found that the current strain of the disease that is killing millions of birds is \u201cdifferent\u201d from previous decades, with birds dying in unprecedented numbers.First birds, now mammals: how H5N1 is killing thousands of sea lions in PeruRead more\u201cWe\u2019ve been dealing with low pathogenic avian influenza for decades in the poultry industry, but this is different,\u201d said Jennifer Mullinax, co-author of the study and an assistant professor in at the University of Maryland\u2019s department of environmental science and technology.\u201cThis high pathogenic virus is wiping out everything in numbers that we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d said Mullinax.The study, published in Conservation Biology, was conducted by tracking the arrival and progression of the lethal avian flu outbreak in North America to see how the latest upsurge of the disease compares to previous ones.Researchers analyzed five different data sources that had information on the presence of avian flu among wild birds and poultry in the US and Canada as well as a global database that had information from 2014 until 2023.Unlike the 2015 outbreak of avian flu (H5N8), the outbreak seen in late 2021 (H5N1) has caused mass mortality for wild birds, which makes the highly pathogenic virus more difficult to wipe out. \u201cUnlike H5N8, this disease is heavily impacting wild birds,\u201d said Johanna Harvey, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Maryland.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to estimate how many birds are truly affected across wild populations, but we\u2019re seeing dramatic disease impacts in raptors, sea birds and colonial nesting birds. And we now have the highest amount of poultry loss to avian influenza, so this is a worst-case scenario.\u201dSome 58 million domestic poultry were infected or were killed to stop the spread of infection in the US, as well as 7 million in Canada, researchers found.The latest outbreak of avian flu may have also shifted to a year-round disease from a more seasonal disease in previous outbreaks.The 2015 avian flu outbreak generally happened in the fall, when farmers could prepare and have more time to recover from losses. But the latest outbreak is occurring throughout the year, in the summertime for wild birds and during the spring and fall for domestic poultry.Researchers concluded that the deadly impact of the disease on wild birds and the change from seasonal infections to ones occurring year-round could signal a dangerous change in the avian flu in the US.The team also concluded that the avian flu will probably become endemic, which could affect food security and the economy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Tighter rules are needed to ensure that the imported \u201cused\u201d cooking oil that airlines hope will power cleaner flights is not in fact virgin palm oil, campaigners have warned.About 80% of waste oil is imported to create biofuels that are mostly still used in cars, vans and lorries despite growing demand from aviation. About 60% of those imports come from China.However, cases of fraud uncovered by investigations suggest a large share of imports could be wrongly labelled as waste instead of repurposed palm oil products. Crop-based biofuels, which were once seen as renewable, are now contributing to deforestation and worsening emissions.A report for the Brussels-based NGO Transport & Environment (T&E) found that while European countries were trying to clamp down on crop-based biofuels, the resultant shift in demand for waste oil was outpacing supply.Europe\u2019s consumption of used cooking oils has more than doubled since 2015, largely to fuel ground transport, and demand is expected to grow as airlines push for sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. Waste cooking oil was the main ingredient in the SAF that solely poweed a UK government-sponsored transatlantic flight by Virgin Atlantic last month.T&E said there were serious concerns about the imports. Barbara Smailagic, a biofuels expert at the NGO, said: \u201cEurope is being flooded with dodgy used cooking oil. European governments say it\u2019s almost impossible to stop virgin oils like palm being labelled as waste. We need greater transparency and a limit on imports to avoid used cooking oil simply becoming a backdoor for deforestation-driving palm oil.\u201dCountries including Germany and Ireland are launching official investigations into fraud risks, while the European Commission has promised to investigate fraudulent Indonesian biodiesel.While imports of palm oil biodiesel have dropped by almost 30%, derivatives of the oil labelled as \u201cwaste\u201d or \u201cresidues\u201d have increased, which T&E said still had significant environmental impacts.Smailagic said: \u201cEurope never tires of finding new things to burn. Sustainable biofuel feedstocks are extremely limited. We need to stop seeing biofuels as a panacea for our climate problem.\u201dThe report recommends that biofuels are phased out in favour of direct electrification for road transport, with any truly sustainable fuels reserved for aviation.Airlines in the EU will be mandated to use at least 6% SAF in their overall fuel burn from the end of the decade and hope to use more, although production levels are still much lower than demand.The UK has yet to create SAF at commercial volumes but the government hopes to have five plants under construction by 2025 and to mandate airlines to use 10% SAF by 2030.Many environmental groups believe that only synthetic kerosene \u2013 made using green hydrogen and reducing carbon dioxide directly in production \u2013 is a truly sustainable aviation fuel, but concerns remain about the huge amounts of renewable energy required to create it.",

This is worse after dark, when as many as four out of five women in Britain say that they would feel unsafe walking alone in a park, compared to two out of five men.\u201cAll these factors mean that women and girls are less likely to use parks than men and boys, a situation which has a significant impact on their lives. Our guidelines, covering 10 principles for design and management, can enable decision-makers to enact change.\u201dOther suggestions in the guidance include organising activities and events to extend women\u2019s use of parks, minimising enclosed and hidden entrances, and designing the placement of facilities, paths and features so that they encourage use by women, maximise visibility, and are easy to navigate.The guidance, in partnership with the organisations Make Space for Girls and Keep Britain Tidy, will be launched as part of a two-day conference beginning on Wednesday, entitled Women and Girls\u2019 Safety in Parks: Lessons from Research and Practice.Imogen Clark, trustee and co-founder of Make Space for Girls, said: \u201cSafety is a big obstacle to teenage girls using parks. We\u2019re really pleased that this guidance considers safety in the round \u2013 making spaces which will be more welcoming for teenage girls.\u201dKeep Britain Tidy\u2019s chief executive, Allison Ogden-Newton, said: \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we understand what makes women and girls feel safe or unsafe across our green spaces and what needs to change to make them feel able to use their local park.\u201d\u201cOur own research already shows that 70% of people in urban areas do not have access to good quality green space, rising to 75.8% in the most deprived areas. When coupled with women\u2019s concerns about using those few green spaces they have access to, it means there is a real inequality. We must tackle it collectively, and as a priority.\u201d\u201cWe are proud to be a part of this important and much-needed project.\u201d",

Originating in Asia, it incurs huge clean-up costs near roads, railways, buildings and other publicly accessible land.Japanese knotweed, introduced in the mid-19th century as an ornamental garden plant, is the next most expensive, costing about \u00a3246.5m as it colonises roadsides, riverbanks and derelict land. It is known to cause damage to lightweight structures such as conservatories, garages and boundary walls, which can be expensive to rectify and decrease the value of properties substantially.Overall, annual estimated costs in 2021 associated with Inns were \u00a33bn for England, \u00a3499m for Scotland, \u00a3343m for Wales and \u00a3150m for Northern Ireland, according to the research carried out by the international scientific organisation Cabi.The species include rabbits, beloved as a pet but hated as a pest, introduced to Britain by the Romans about 2,000 years go. They can destroy agricultural areas by overgrazing, while burrowing affects the quality of pastures, meaning rabbits cost an estimated \u00a3170m. Rats and mice (\u00a384m), cockroaches (\u00a369m) and non-native deer (\u00a362m) are among other costly species.The cost to forestry from Inns has increased eightfold since the previous report in 2010 and is now estimated at \u00a3123m, while in agriculture, the most affected industry, they cost the UK economy about \u00a31.1bn. Their impact on construction, development and infrastructure was \u00a3270m, and on tourism and recreation it was \u00a3136m, the scientists said.Dr Richard Shaw, a Cabi co-author of the research, which was published in the journal Biological Invasions, said: \u201cThis assessment again shows the important costs of Inns to the UK economy. Few effects of Inns specific management efforts can be seen in these results. However, they highlight the need to continue prevention and early detection, followed by eradication of the highest-risk species prior to establishment.\u201dEstablished non-native species include killer shrimp, giant hogweed, mink and parakeets, while those that have arrived recently and had a big impact include H fraxineus and the sea squirt Didemnum vexillum.Dr Rene Eschen, the lead author and a Cabi senior scientist, said that while the overall cost of Inns to the UK economy had increased, there had also been decreases in some species such as rabbits, possibly due to effective management. This article was amended on 6 July 2023. An earlier version said that Japanese knotweed \u201cis known to cause structural damage to properties\u201d. The latest guidance from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is that it poses little or no risk of structural damage to robust buildings with substantial foundations such as dwellings, as opposed to less sturdy structures with shallow foundations, such as conservatories, garages or boundary walls.

He\u2019s rehabilitated so many species, from warthogs to gerenuks, and he\u2019s never lost an animal under his care. He has rescued even the most vulnerable, difficult creatures, such as Gr\u00e9vy\u2019s zebra, which is a highly endangered species.Lekupania works in Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy in the far north of Kenya. The giraffe is an orphaned baby \u201creticulated giraffe\u201d named Fupi, which means Shorty in Swahili. Fupi was injured when he fell into a ditch. He was rehabilitated and returned to the wild. And now all the rehabilitated giraffes come every morning to check on Lekupania. They do a round of the stables and greet him, then make their way back to the wild.This photo was taken in 2016, during a period of drought. Giraffes today are slowly and silently becoming extinct. Sometimes that\u2019s due to poaching, but in this part of Kenya it\u2019s mostly drought-related and from habitat loss. Current estimates suggest giraffe populations across Africa have dropped 40% in three decades, from around 155,000 in the late 1980s to less than 100,000 today. And there are fewer than 16,000 reticulated giraffes across Africa. West African and Rothschild\u2019s giraffes are facing even more dire situations.The moment passed quickly: Fupi leaned in and that was itI only have a few frames of this moment. I was quite far away when I saw it. Trying not to scare the giraffe, I moved in quickly and quietly so that I could capture the intimacy between those two.

I spent four years photographing the conflict between India and Pakistan \u2013 to try to understand it more deeply.I realised the backdrop of every story was the natural world. In some cases, it was the scarcity of basic resources, like water. In others, it was the changing climate and loss of fertile soil.

But the term forgotten veg also covers those not-at-their-best specimens at the back of the fridge, such as limp lettuce and borderline beets, all of which can be turned into delicious soup.Forgotten vegetable soupIf we want to save food from being wasted, it is imperative that we learn at least in part to cook without strict recipes, inventing delicious dishes from leftovers and past-its-best produce.

These quantities will make one 300-500ml portion of soup, so multiply the quantities by the number of mouths you want to feed.

Two-thirds of these complaints were not followed up, and only a handful led to any action.Urban areas with high particulate pollution face restrictions on burning wood, to avoid more particulates spewing into the air. Particle pollution is associated with increased mortality from causes including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as lung cancer.Dirty air causes 26,000 to 38,000 early deaths a year in England, and the particles are linked to many other health problems including dementia and depression. Wood burning has overtaken traffic in the UK as one of the most harmful sources of the smallest particles, known as PM2.5. Emissions of PM2.5 from wood burning increased by 35% between 2010 and 2020, the Times reported.In smoke-control areas, households can only burn unauthorised fuels, such as wood, on appliances that are rigorously tested to demonstrate low-smoke emissions. Fines of up to \u00a3300 and criminal prosecutions, which could result in fines of up to \u00a35,000, can be brought under the Environment Act 2021.Only about 8% of people in the UK burn solid-fuels indoors, meaning a small minority are responsible for significant amounts of pollution. Two-thirds of these people live in urban areas, where the impact of air pollution is worst, and virtually all of them have other sources of heating.Research by the campaign group Mums for Lungs found 80 local authorities said they were not using the new powers, while 47 councils said the measures did not apply to them.In January, the government promised to introduce legislation after the publication of the environmental improvement plan (EIP) 2023 that would cut the emissions limit of wood burning stoves from 5g smoke an hour to 3g.The government then weakened its message in August, when the air quality strategy framework for local authority delivery rowed back on the EIP language, suggesting ministers would \u201clook to strengthen\u201d the effect of smoke-control areas, and consult on potentially reducing the limit.Jemima Hartshorn, founder of Mums for Lungs, said: \u201cThe government claims to have \u2018world leading\u2019 legal provisions to address air pollution but our research shows these are abjectly failing.

Guardian Australia verified the entries on an earlier version of the list that recorded 350 sponsorships.Belinda Noble, from ComsDeclare, a group of Australian public relations professionals campaigning for a fossil fuel ad ban, said the deals were about building influence.\u201cIt\u2019s a subtle way of trying to engineer social support, or continued social support, for these polluting products,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of these companies don\u2019t sell to the general population. There\u2019s no reason for them to be spending millions of dollars on sports and arts sponsorships. What they\u2019re trying to do is sell their brand.\u201dWoodside and Santos were asked for their response. A spokesperson for BHP said the coal from its mines was used in steelmaking, in which there are fewer commercially viable alternatives, and not power generation. They said the company spent $106m in partnerships with more than 250 organisations in Australia during the last financial year.\u201cThrough these investments we aim to make contributions that are community-led, relevant and important to the regions where we operate, where many of our employees live and our local suppliers are based,\u201d the BHP spokesperson said.The terms of sponsorship deals are rarely public and are often covered by non-disclosure agreements. Depending on the organisation and the type of partnership, some are thought to be worth a few thousand dollars. Others, including naming rights deals on major venues or events, can run into the millions.Researchers working in partnership with the Australian Conservation Foundation have previously estimated the value of fossil fuel sponsorships to Australian sport were between $14m and $18m a year.In some centres, such as Mackay, fossil fuel money has supported several major institutions within the city. In Canberra, Woodside and Shell sponsored the annual press gallery ball this year. Ampol and Shell also serve as gold partners to the Walkley Foundation.2022 in review: is this the year Australia faced its climate reckoning?Read moreKelly Albion, senior campaigner with 350.org, said organisations should consider their policies governing accepting sponsorships, but responsibility ultimately lay with governments and companies.\u201cI think it\u2019s not on the clubs and organisations \u2013 they need money to operate and often those companies are coming in there with big offers,\u201d Albion said. \u201cOften athletes or artists are unable to speak up when their clubs take on these arrangements.\u201dThe survey found education institutions had 132 known sponsorship deals, community groups 124 and sports organisations 111.According to the survey, the education organisations that partnered most frequently with fossil fuel companies included the Queensland Minerals Education Academy, a partnership between the Queensland government and Queensland Resources Council (20 agreements), Central Queensland University (10) and the Clontarf Foundation, which helps improve educational outcomes for Indigenous people (eight).Central Queensland University disputed this count, saying one company identified was no longer a donor and another partnership arrangement advertised on the university website was double counted. Chris Veraa, CQU\u2019s director of strategic engagement, said the university was a \u201cvalues-driven organisation\u201d and that \u201cthe resources sector is a central part of the economy and social makeup of the regions we serve\u201d.\u201cCQU unashamedly engages with the sector where our combined efforts can enhance outcomes for the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in our community, empower First Nations people and communities, improve training and employment outcomes, and support best-of-breed environmental rehabilitation,\u201d Veraa said.The head of the International Energy Agency has said the global goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C, included in landmark 2015 Paris agreement, meant no new oil and gas fields or coal power plants should open beyond 2021.",

        "text": "Britain has set a new record for wind generation as power from onshore and offshore turbines helped boost clean energy supplies late last year.National Grid\u2019s electricity system operator (ESO), which handles Great Britain\u2019s grid, said that a new record for wind generation was set on 30 December, when 20.91 gigawatts (GW) were produced by turbines.This represented the third time Britain\u2019s fleet of wind turbines set new generation records in 2022. In May, National Grid had to ask some turbines in the west of Scotland to shut down, as the network was unable to store such a large amount of electricity when a then record 19.9GW of power was produced \u2013 enough to boil 3.5m kettles.The ESO said a new record was also set for the share of electricity on the grid coming from zero-carbon sources \u2013 renewables and nuclear \u2013 which supplied 87.2% of total power. These sources have accounted for about 55% to 59% of power over the past couple of years.The surge in wind generation represents a remarkable reversal in fortunes as a cold snap that enveloped Britain and Europe quickly turned to milder weather.Power prices had soared as the freezing weather forced Britons to increase their heating use, pushing up demand for energy despite high bills.The cold weather came with a period of low wind, reducing the production of Britain\u2019s windfarms to close to zero.Emergency coal-fired power units at Drax in North Yorkshire were put on standby but ultimately not used, while gas-fired generation accounted for nearly 60% of the UK\u2019s power output at times.However, milder weather in the UK and Europe in recent days has led to a reduction in demand from consumers and a fall in wholesale gas prices. It has also reduced the risk of power cuts this winter, which National Grid had warned could be a possibility.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The fines, for driving within London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), were \u20ac95.96 (\u00a384.10) each if paid by the end of last November, two months before they reached me. As I\u2019d missed the deadline, they were \u20ac287.88 each. My car is a leased Volkswagen Passat GTE (a petrol/electric hybrid) and is Euro 6 compliant, yet I\u2019m facing a \u20ac1,727.28 bill. I tried repeatedly to challenge the fines, but each time the TfL website returned an error message, so I made an online representation to EPC, but have been told by TfL the fines still stand.AL, Braunschweig, GermanyThe Ulez, introduced in central London in 2019, and due to be expanded across Greater London in August, requires drivers of the most polluting vehicles to pay a daily charge. However, those from mainland Europe have been hit with fines amounting to thousands of euros, despite driving compliant cars.Vehicles from overseas must be pre-registered with TfL before entering the zone, otherwise they may be deemed non-compliant. In 2022, 167,663 fines were sent overseas. Unluckily for you, EPC, which enforces them, recently gained access to vehicle-keeper records in Germany, the Netherlands and France, and has been making up for lost time by firing off PCNs for alleged offences months previously.Amazingly, there is no legal cut-off after which PCNs cannot be issued. By the time they reach drivers (in your case via the leasing company, which caused added delays), they have rocketed, for one couple to \u00a33,589 after a trip to London.TfL says the registration process for foreign vehicles is on its website, but you\u2019d have to know of the requirement to look. It says overseas vehicles are deemed polluting by default if EPC is unable to confirm emission details from the relevant licensing authority. And it claims that, if a driver can prove the vehicle is compliant, it will cancel the PCN.Not in your case. You were informed there was no option to appeal since the fine was being enforced by EPC. Asked why payment deadlines are not extended for overseas drivers, given postal delays, TfL says it expects EPC to act \u201creasonably\u201d.TfL cancelled the charges after I got in touch.

Pepper says the desperately needed revenue will go into helping residents hit by the energy crisis, including draught-proofing homes, providing energy-saving devices like slow cookers, and boosting emergency funds.\u201cPeople on pre-paid meters are self-disconnecting. Today I\u2019ve just signed 12 applications for \u00a3100 each to pay for people\u2019s emergency credit as they\u2019ve run out. They are on brink of having no heating or power,\u201d says Pepper. \u201cThere are single parents, working families, and retired people \u2013 it\u2019s a real mix.\u201dEngineers from Ambition Community Energy, which will be managing the turbine on behalf of Ambition Lawrence Weston, are on-site to see a 121m crane assemble the four remaining sections of the turbine tower, which weigh 80 tonnes each. The base of the tower is secured on 22m deep concrete and steel reinforced foundations, which will anchor the turbine in the fiercest of storms.\u201cThere is a massive downforce [from the foundations] to make sure this thing doesn\u2019t take off,\u201d explains Charles Gamble, the community interest company\u2019s electrical engineer, as he walks around the perimeter of the site. \u201cIn some freak storm, you\u2019d have this enormous lever trying to push the entire turbine over but it won\u2019t because it\u2019s engineered by smart people.\u201dGround near Avonmouth is prepared for the construction of Ambition Lawrence Weston\u2019s wind turbine.

There is no ringfenced funding for community energy projects and government subsidies are only available to commercial-scale windfarms, producing more than 5MW. \u201cIt should have been a hell of a lot easier to build this turbine,\u201d says Pepper.However, other communities in the region may soon get the chance to follow Lawrence Weston. David Tudgey, the project\u2019s development manager, who took the turbine through planning and funding rounds, has managed to secure new funding from the region\u2019s Labour metro mayor, Dan Norris, to help local groups build their own turbines. \u201cWe\u2019ve got \u00a31.5m to develop 10 more turbines \u2013 it\u2019s an incredibly exciting project, which will potentially benefit lots of communities across the region,\u201d he says.It is thought to be the first regionally funded community energy scheme in the country. \u201cThe West of England is going to become a beacon as to how communities can be genuinely levelled up through a just energy transition,\u201d says Tudgey. \u201cThat is what we are leading on in the West Country.\u201d",

There were reports that a suspected tornado developed across Jersey during the early hours of the night, accompanied by hailstones the size of golf balls. Serious damage was inflicted on properties, with windows being blown in, roofs torn off houses and debris damaging cars.There were no reports of UK casualties, which, unfortunately, cannot be said for other parts of western Europe.

The MSLP is the pressure of the atmosphere adjusted to the height of the mean sea level. An MSLP of 953.3 hPa was recorded in Plymouth, while 958.5 hPa was observed in St Athan, beating the previous records of 959.7 hPa (1916) and 962.7 hPa (2010) for England and Wales respectively.Meanwhile, dense \u201csuperfog\u201d in Louisiana in the US caused several serious car crashes on Monday 23 October, with one multi-car pileup on the interstate 55 highway to the north-west of New Orleans killing eight people. More than 20 people were taken to hospital, with 168 vehicles involved in the fatal collision. A tanker carrying hazardous liquid was caught up in the crash, and many vehicles caught fire.The crash occurred when fog combined with smoke from nearby marsh fires, reducing visibility to as low as 3 metres (10ft). Superfog is a common phenomenon and occurs when smoke and moisture from burning organic material mixes with moist cool air. The smoke particles attach to the water molecules creating dense fog, which causes hazardously low visibility.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In March, the Coalition party room resolved to support the bill in principle because it had proposed the same scheme in government.In late May the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, told the Guardian\u2019s Australian Politics podcast that the bill was \u201cbasically verbatim our legislation\u201d, saying he was \u201cproud of the fact that it\u2019s stood the test of time \u2013 of a changing government\u201d.\u201cThat\u2019s one thing that I\u2019m profoundly proud of, to have a world-first that actually is going to improve our biodiversity on our farms around this country and beyond.\u201dBut on 13 June, Littleproud told the lower house that Labor\u2019s bill had \u201cdiverged far too far\u201d from the one the Morrison government introduced in February 2022, claiming it was no longer about \u201crewarding farmers for the stewardship of their land\u201d.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nLittleproud noted that pilots were already in place, meaning that \u201ccertificates would have been able to be traded once this legislation went through\u201d.But he claimed Labor \u201clet their ideology\u201d get in the way, by deciding to strip the role of overseeing the scheme from the agriculture department and give it to the environment department.The shadow environment minister, Jonathon Duniam, said the Coalition was responding to \u201cmore and more stakeholder dissatisfaction with the legislation\u201d.\u201cIn government, our bill for a biodiversity market was deliberately confined to agricultural land.

However, the consultation has been delayed amid growing controversy over the government\u2019s links to the housebuilding sector.The consultation was originally expected in March, before it was delayed to the summer and then scheduled for the end of the year. The plans will be finalised by next March.Green groups claim that the government has allowed housebuilders to save billions of pounds by delaying the new standards, which are expected to increase construction costs. In October, the Guardian revealed that at least 10% of donations received by the Conservative party since 2010 \u2013 about \u00a340m \u2013 came from property developers, real estate tycoons and others connected with the construction industry.David Cowdrey, a director at the MCS Foundation, which accredits home energy installers, said: \u201cMaking heat pumps the default heating source for all new homes and banning gas and hydrogen boilers is absolutely the right step for the climate and for households\u2019 energy bills.\u201cAllowing fossil fuel or hydrogen heating in new homes would have locked in high bills and high carbon emissions for a generation. It is a huge relief that we are escaping that possibility and that the government has recognised the conclusive evidence that heat pumps and heat networks are the only viable option for getting our homes to net zero and ensuring low bills for people in new-build homes.\u201dJuliet Phillips, a senior policy adviser at the climate thinktank E3G, said the decision to ensure all new homes were built to be highly efficient and warmed by low-carbon heating was \u201cperhaps the most popular and common sense of climate policies\u201d.She said: \u201cThis is great news for homebuyers, who will save money on energy bills and avoid the need for costly retrofits in the future. It\u2019s also great news for the UK\u2019s clean-tech industry, providing the long-term policy certainty needed to boost investment in skills and supply chains.\u201dThe requirement for all new homes to be built to highly efficient standards was originally proposed in 2006, which would have required all new houses to be \u201czero carbon\u201d and generate as much energy as possible onsite from 2016. This proposal was scrapped in 2015. About 1.5m homes are estimated to have been built without these low-carbon fittings since 2015.

Gardeners take pictures or samples of afflicted trees, crops or flowers and send them in to the plant pathologists, who can identify the disease.This year, seven of 2022\u2019s 10 most prevalent garden diseases relate to fruit, which the RHS says is the highest it has seen. Apple and pear canker also entered the top 10 for the first time in recent years.Traditional British garden under threat from extreme heat, says RHSRead moreDr Liz Beal, a plant pathologist at the RHS, said: \u201cThis is a direct result of last year\u2019s extreme summer heat, which caused many plants to become stressed and therefore more susceptible to problems when rain, coupled with continuing mild temperatures in the autumn, provided the perfect breeding ground for diseases to spread. Spores of most fungi need warm, wet weather to spread and infect plants.\u201dWhile many of these diseases simply cause fruit to rot or give an unsightly appearance, others can be deadly. Particularly worrying is a rise in silverleaf, which can destroy blossoming cherry trees.She explained: \u201cWith warm weather predicted again this year, gardeners can act now to minimise the risks by pruning apples and pear that are still dormant and avoiding pruning Prunus \u2013 flowering cherry \u2013 until the summer. This is as Prunus is susceptible to silver leaf and the fungi is less active during the summer months.\u201dHorticulturalists are keeping a keen eye out for new diseases and invasive species, as warming weather combined with the international plant trade means that it is becoming more likely the UK will experience new outbreaks.Blueberries fruiting in England. The RHS warns the popularity of growing the \u2018superfood\u2019 is increasing risks of less disease-resilient plants being imported into the UK. Photograph: Dean Fosdick/APDr Beal said that she is concerned about blueberry rust becoming more prevalent, as people grow the \u201csuperfood\u201d at home.She said: \u201cWith gardeners keen to dabble with ever more exotic fruit and vegetables it is likely that we could see more blueberry growers, well regarded as a super food and boasting spring flowers and autumn colour, succumbing to a new rust already prevalent in many parts of the world. People should take care to purchase blueberry plants from reputable suppliers and monitor plants for signs of the rust \u2013 yellow \u2013 orange pustules on underside of leaves.\u201dAs well as climate impacts, establishing orchards has become an increasingly popular gardening pastime, as they have biodiversity benefits and produce delicious fruit.Dr Beal explained: \u201cAnother factor in the prevalence of these diseases is the growing popularity of fruit tree planting, particularly heritage varieties that may be less resistant to the likes of apple and pear scab, apple canker and apple powdery mildew. This doesn\u2019t mean that people shouldn\u2019t grow them but that they should take additional plant health precautions such as ensuring the tree is planted in the right place, for example in well-drained soil, prune correctly in the winter months to remove issues early and clear fallen fruit that shows evidence of rot to minimise the chances of spores harbouring at the foot of the tree.\u201dThe top plant diseases of 20221 Honey fungusskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

One analysis estimated 417 excess deaths resulted from longer-term consequences of the fires and smoke exposure.Ademi said it was unclear what the health and economic burden of bushfires in the future may be. She and her team constructed a model that simulated follow-up of the entire Australian population yearly from 2021 to 2030, capturing bushfire deaths and years of life lived. The population in the model was updated each year by considering births, deaths and net inward migration.\nSign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads\nThe impact of bushfires on gross domestic product over this period totalled $17.2bn, the model predicted, while 2,418 lives would be lost to bushfires. The model made conservative predictions, as it assumed no changes to GDP over the time period given uncertainty regarding inflation in the current economic climate.The model also did not estimate the health burden of bushfire smoke due to non-physical conditions, such as mental health, nor the burden borne by community-based healthcare services, and did not capture the impact on GP consultations nor the increased dispensation of medications for respiratory conditions. The costs of devoting healthcare resources away from other conditions was also not considered.\u201cEven based on conservative assumptions, the health and economic burden of bushfires in Australia looms large,\u201d the paper, published in the journal Current Problems in Cardiology, concluded.\u201cHuman-induced climate change is increasing the likelihood of catastrophic wildfires. This underscores the importance of actions to mitigate bushfire risk.\u201dAdemi said measures such as improved fuel reduction and prescribed burning practices would be crucial to reduce health and economic burdens. While individual action was important, such as reducing fuel around property, adhering to total fire bans and reconsidering living in areas likely to be affected by fire \u2013 which she said for many people was not a \u201cchoice\u201d \u2013 these individual actions were not enough to mitigate risk.\u201cWe need urgent involvement of government to speed up implementation of green and sustainable technologies, and we need to use collective actions at our disposable for effective social change,\u201d she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Five Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Photograph: Aris Martinez/ReutersThe protests were sparked by concerns that the mining project would cause deforestation and pilfer water supplies, but the movement quickly snowballed into a broader expression of political unrest.The swift dealmaking between President Laurentino Cortizo\u2019s government and the Canadian mining giant First Quantum prompted allegations of corruption as labour unions and Indigenous groups also took to the streets.Protesters blocked the Panamerican highway and used small boats to blockade the mine\u2019s port, forcing it to reduce its output.Cortizo\u2019s attempt to temper the growing anger with a referendum on the mine\u2019s future failed to calm the turmoil, leaving the matter to the constitutional court.If the government shuts down the project it will be a major hit to the Central American country\u2019s economy just as it is losing revenues from the Panama Canal where traffic is restricted by drought, said mining expert Paul Harris. \u201cThe minimum royalties guaranteed for the government are $375m a year,\u201d he said.The Cobre Panama mine cost $6.8bn to construct and its operations accounts for aboutr 3% of Panama\u2019s GDP and 75% of its exports.Protesters will not abandon the cause as the mining giant could appeal the decision, but Guevara said she hoped the movement could leave the streets and move to a new phase of civic participation to avoid unnecessary deaths.\u201cI hope the decision ends the project but also the state of uncertainty which has kept people on the streets fighting and suffering,\u201d Guevara said.",

        "text": "A study has concluded that air pollution is accelerating osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.Researchers scanned the bones of more than 9,000 women living in four different parts of the US. Each had a bone scan three times over a six-year period that was compared with the air they breathed. On average, air pollution accounted for a doubling of the speed of bone loss.In the US, 10 million people are thought to have osteoporosis, of whom about 80% are women. The condition weakens bones and is linked to more than 2m fractures a year in the US, with a cost of more than $20bn (\u00a316.9bn) annually. Only about 40% of these people regain full independence after their fracture. In the UK, osteoporosis affects 3.8 million people and the resulting fractures account for about 2% of total healthcare spending. Small changes in the progress of the disease or the number of resulting bone fractures could therefore have a very large impact on healthcare systems and on the quality of life for many people.The new study helps to explain earlier work by the same research group that looked at hospitalisation for fractures among more than 9 million people in the eastern US. Here the team found that particle pollution increased the number of incidents of people being taken to hospital with fractures by 8% in their study group.Importantly these studies show effects at air pollution concentrations that are well below the current limits in the US and Europe, and well below the UK government\u2019s proposed limits for 2040.Dr Diddier Prada, from the US study team at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, said: \u201cThe global population is getting older because of increased life expectancy and declining birth rates. We should identify, and eliminate, critical factors that affect human health during ageing. Postmenopausal women are susceptible to bone fractures and reductions in bone mineral density because of oestrogen reduction but also air pollution. Further action is needed to reduce air pollution from diesel vehicles and wider fossil fuel use to protect public health. These may result in enormous reductions in hospitalisation, costs, and even mortality.\u201dThe US researchers found the lumbar spine was most susceptible to air pollution-induced bone loss and especially from nitrogen oxides. These are a group of pollutants including nitrogen dioxide that breaches legal limits along many main roads in the UK and across Europe. These breaches have persisted since the start of the century, exposing many people to high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide. This comes mainly from traffic, especially the large numbers of diesel vehicles that were manufactured to pass exhaust tests but produced much more pollution when used on our roads. These are the target of policies such as London\u2019s ultra low emission zone and the clean air zones elsewhere.In the UK, a recent study of people living with more than one chronic illness found osteoporosis among the conditions associated with air pollution and a further study found links between air pollution, lower bone density and increased fractures. Research on the linkage between bone health and air pollution is an emerging field, including studies on people in rural China, but a consistent research approach is yet to emerge, making it hard to compare findings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This is a worrying finding because low bone mineral density is the biggest risk factor for hip fractures, which kill around one in three people and disable one in three. The next important research step is to discover a physiological mechanism to confirm whether exposure to air pollution really does damage bone health.\u201d",

        "text": "The UK will need to embrace innovative, community-based solutions to environmental and energy problems if it is to have any hope of meeting looming net-zero deadlines, a cross-party group of MPs and peers has recommended.A report by the all-party group on a green new deal argues for a combination of robust, top-down policies on green issues including localised power generation, food and transport schemes. Recommendations include a mortgage penalty for landlords who let energy-inefficient homes, and also real community decision-making, notably on power schemes.Highlighting projects such as one in Gwynedd, north Wales, in which locals buy electricity from a community hydroplant at below grid prices, with a further discount for off-peak use, they recommend changes to regulations to incentivise such schemes.As part of the \u201cenergy club\u201d in Bethesda, homes pay as little as 8p per kW/h overnight, with bills staying lower than grid prices if they do not cumulatively use more energy than the local plant produces, with savings from power being generated nearby.One of the report\u2019s recommendations is for a so-called right of local supply, as seen in some other European countries, which would incentivise such systems through improved access to the grid, and assistance with providing power to local people.Such changes are vital, the report said, if the UK is to meet the first of its major net zero targets, to reduce carbon emissions by 68% below 1990 levels by 2030.The report, based on a series of evidence sessions, including with academics, energy experts and devolved mayors, calls for ambitious centralised targets and incentives alongside localism, citing rules such as those in France obliging new buildings to have solar or natural roofs, and in Denmark and Netherlands where new developments are barred from being connected to the gas grid.More generally, the report says, the 2030 target should become a binding obligation for all projects planned by public sector organisations and agencies.Among ideas to improve home energy efficiency, the report says any buy-to-let rental properties with an energy performance certificate below C should face a 1% levy on mortgage interest \u2013 which would be fully refunded if the band was attained within three years.Another proposed boost for localism would be a 50% business rate reduction for food outlets that can show at least half their produce is grown within 50 miles.Another call for devolved control comes in transport, with the report calling for local authorities to get powers to provide integrated public transit services, with funding for free or low cost fares, and money for schemes like that in Barcelona, where people who get rid of their car are given three years of free local travel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Meanwhile, Europe is experiencing its warmest January days on record and communities around the world are grappling with extreme weather events supercharged by the climate crisis.\u201dGraphic showing the lengths of private jet flights to the 2022 World Economic Forum meetingOf the flights to airports near Davos last year, 53% were short-haul flights of less than 750km (466 miles), which could have been done by rail or car, while 38% were over distances of less than 500km. The shortest flight recorded was just 13 miles.The 2023 WEF meeting has a self-proclaimed goal of tackling the climate emergency and other \u201congoing crises\u201d, and has called for \u201cbold collective action\u201d. Private jet flights are not regulated in the EU, but they are the most polluting mode of transport per passenger kilometre.Schenk urged leaders not to travel by private jet this year and to ban their use in general. \u201cGiven that 80% of the world\u2019s population has never even flown, but suffers from the consequences of climate-damaging aviation emissions, and that the WEF claims to be committed to the 1.5C Paris climate target, this annual private jet bonanza is a distasteful masterclass in hypocrisy,\u201d she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The island has experienced other serious fires in recent years, with blazes in 2018 and 2021 razing hundreds of homes and causing the evacuation of thousands of residents and tourists.Experts say that wildfires in Hawaii are now burning through four times the amount of area than in previous decades, in part due to the proliferation of more flammable non-native grasses but also rising global temperatures.\u201cWe can say there are conditions that are consistent with wildfire, wildfire size and expansion that are changing as climate changes,\u201d Erica Fleishman, a climate scientist at Oregon State University told CNN. \u201cAnd some of the things that we\u2019re seeing with this wildfire in Maui are consistent with some of the trends that are known and projected as climate changes.\u201dFires mapHawaii is experiencing increasingly dry conditions, with scientists calculating that 90% of the state is getting less rainfall than it did a century ago, with the period since 2008 particularly dry.The growing susceptibility of Hawaii to major fires was highlighted by a 2015 study that found that rainfall has been 31% lower in the wet season since 1990, in selected monitoring sites on the islands. The state, known for its volcanoes and lush forests, is in parts drying out as global heating continues to escalate.The flames that tore through Lahaina, meanwhile, were fanned by winds from the passing Hurricane Dora and the climate crisis is causing an overall increase in strong cyclones in the central Pacific. The influence of the cyclone upon the fires surprised scientists, given that Dora was churning around 500 miles away from Maui.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Children\u2019s doctors are calling for an outright ban on disposable vapes to reduce their popularity among young people as the long-term impact on lungs, hearts and brains remains unknown.The government should ban single-use disposable vapes, which can be bought for just \u00a31.99 and are most popular with young people, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has said.This would reduce their environmental impact and discourage children who have never smoked from taking up vaping and risking long-term addiction and lung damage.Dr Mike McKean, the RCPH vice-president and a paediatric respiratory consultant, said the college had made a \u201cvery carefully considered call\u201d, reflecting concerns from its members about the \u201cepidemic\u201d of child vaping, the limited research into the longer-term health impacts, and the small but growing numbers of children with respiratory problems.\u201cIt took decades to understand relationship of cigarette smoking to cancer and respiratory illnesses \u2013 my worry is we could be sleepwalking into a similar situation here,\u201d McKean said.\u201cIf you know about lung development, you know that if you inhale potentially noxious, volatile substances there is a huge potential for an inflammatory reaction that could have a minor or a major effect. There is lots of evidence it causes significant coughing and breathlessness. We\u2019re not seeing lots of highly damaged lungs yet, but there are cases reported where the inflammatory response is overwhelming and causes permanent scarring.\u201dHe said that while he thought Australia\u2019s approach, where vapes are only available on prescription, might overburden the NHS, England\u2019s permissive approach was \u201cout of step\u201d with neighbouring countries, such as Scotland, France, Germany and Ireland. So far, England has banned free vape samples for under-18s and may prohibit colourful packaging and flavour names that target younger people.Ministers had the power to \u201ceasily\u201d ban disposable vapes, he said, and he hoped they would respond \u201cas fast as possible\u201d to submissions to the government\u2019s call for evidence on youth vaping, which closes on 6 June, to avoid the problem getting kicked into the political long grass before the next general election. \u201cIf you\u2019re 12 and starting to vape regularly we can\u2019t wait for that 12-year-old to be 13 or 14, we need action now.\u201dHe added he thought there was a \u201cmoral imperative\u201d to prevent companies from profiting from long-term addictions by targeting children with colourful packaging and fruity flavours.The ban would also reduce the environmental harm caused by e-cigarettes, which waste lithium needed for batteries to power electric cars and increase plastic waste, as 1.3 million vapes are thrown away every week in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "The climate is changing more quickly now than it has done for tens of millions of years. This was the blunt conclusion to the BBC\u2019s recent Earth series, which sought to convey to viewers how cataclysmic the disruption caused by global heating could be. Chris Packham, its presenter, described the tipping points that were reached 56m years ago, when, over the course of a few thousand years, temperatures climbed by 5C. Fossil records from this period are one resource that modern scientists use when trying to predict the consequences of the much faster heating that is now under way.Planetary boundaries, about which scientists this week issued an updated warning, are another tool for thinking about the environment. These are a set of parameters defined at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, led by Prof Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, in 2009. They are limits within which changes to the Earth\u2019s life support systems, which have been relatively stable for 10,000 years, can be considered manageable. Once the boundaries are breached, however, everything becomes much more extreme, unstable and threatening. As well as an attempt at quantifying the disruption that natural systems can withstand, the nine boundaries represented an attempt to broaden understanding of the risks. One key message was that global heating caused by greenhouse gases trapped in the atmosphere is not the only threat.The latest assessment, that six out of the nine boundaries have been broken, is yet another wake-up call. For the first time, scientists assessed the situation across the whole world and are particularly concerned about their findings with regard to biodiversity, freshwater and land use. Along with phasing out fossil fuels, they argue that ending destructive farming practices \u2013 which cause deforestation, habitat loss and pollution on a massive scale \u2013 is now the most urgent priority.Prof Simon Lewis describes the boundaries framework as a \u201cheroic attempt to simplify the world\u201d. As such, it has something in common with Kate Raworth\u2019s doughnut economics. But, however valuable such concepts are, ultimately they will be judged on whether they can help prompt the imposition of actual limits on fossil fuel production, and other damaging activity, that can only be imposed by governments.The phasing out of coal, oil and gas was dropped from last year\u2019s Cop27 climate summit. This week, Fatih Birol, who heads the International Energy Agency, said that it must be back on the agenda at Cop28, which opens in Dubai in two months. Confidence in the UN climate process was damaged by the appointment of Sultan Al Jaber as this year\u2019s president. He also heads the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. Currently, the UAE is planning a massive expansion of oil and gas.But opposition to the UAE\u2019s plans, and those of Saudi Arabia and western oil businesses, is growing. Rishi Sunak is expected to miss a climate ambition summit hosted by the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, next week. His enthusiasm for new oil and gas investments may have disqualified him from attending. But other leaders will be urged to seize the chance to set the world on a path to a transformed energy system. With evidence of the suffering caused by global heating continuing to accumulate, alongside alarming assessments from experts, the need for governments to formally acknowledge the planet\u2019s boundaries, and act accordingly, has never been greater.",

        "text": "Virgin births may sound biblical, but researchers have said they have found a way to induce female fruit flies to produce offspring when there are no males around.Scientists said they identified the genes that enable one species of fruit fly to produce young without their eggs being fertilised by sperm. They then genetically tweaked another species that normally reproduces sexually to do the same.\u201cWe\u2019re the first to show that you can engineer virgin births to happen in an animal \u2013 it was very exciting to see a virgin fly produce an embryo able to develop to adulthood, and then repeat the process,\u201d said Dr Alexis Sperling, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and first author of the paper outlining the study.The research, published in the journal Current Biology, was conducted over six years and used 220,000 flies.The researchers first looked at a species of fruit fly called Drosophila mercatorum, and its ability to reproduce through virgin births, or parthenogenesis.By sequencing the fly\u2019s genome, and identifying the gene involved in virgin birth, the researchers were able to identify the corresponding gene in another species of fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and alter that gene to turn it on.The team found the genetically manipulated female flies usually waited about 40 days in case they found a male to reproduce with before triggering a virgin birth instead.The offspring of such genetically modified flies were able to reproduce either by mating with males or through virgin births.Sperling said that switching to virgin birth could be hugely beneficial for the species and serve as a reproductive backup for isolated females.But she noted there was also a potential negative, as virgin births might reduce the ability of the species to adapt to environmental pressures.And Sperling added there could be another issue:\u201cIf there\u2019s continued selection pressure for virgin births in insect pests, which there seems to be, it will eventually lead to them reproducing only in this way,\u201d she said.\u201cIt could become a real problem for agriculture because females produce only females, so their ability to spread doubles.\u201dSperling added that while the new research has found a way to \u201cswitch on\u201d virgin births in fruit flies, it is unlikely the approach would work in mammals, despite parthenogenesis having been observed in animals such as lizards and honey bees.That is because mammals need both the paternal and maternal genomes, while the paternal genome is dispensable in species that can undergo virgin births.\u201cMammals are very separate and it is not a natural occurring phenomenon,\u201d Sperling said, adding that the success of the work in fruit flies was, in part, down to the longstanding use of the insects in research, meaning their genetics are well-understood.But the research helped to \u201cunderstand the beauty of life itself\u201d and \u201cthis different type of reproduction\u201d.Dr Hannah Maude at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the work, also stressed that the findings were unlikely to apply to humans.\u201cOur diversity protects us: having two copies of the DNA not only provides a backup for harmful DNA variants \u2013 found in every person \u2013 but is necessary for so-called imprinted regions that are specifically active from the maternal or paternal DNA copy,\u201d she said.\u201cNevertheless, this exciting research furthers our understanding of reproduction in the animal kingdom.\u201d",

Two of the most prolific dunkers showed rusk was preferentially eaten wet. Dried banana chips and dried coconut chips were also occasionally dipped in water, but the duo tended to prefer them dry.\u201cThe behaviour seemed to be mainly targeted at rusk, a dry and hard food type that easily absorbs water and adopts a soggy texture,\u201d the team write.The researchers found the seven cockatoos showed considerable variation in how long they left their pieces of rusk in the water, although some left them long enough for the core to go soft \u2013 according to the team\u2019s own rusk-dunking experiments.The team say the lack of live prey rules out the possibility the birds were trying to drown their food, while freely available water makes it unlikely they were dunking to gain fluid.Roosters may be able to recognise their reflection, study findsRead more\u201cSeasoning behaviour also seems implausible as they dunk food in fresh, unflavoured tap water,\u201d they write, adding the pickiness of the birds about which foods they dunked suggests they were not trying to wash the food.As a result, the team say the birds probably dunked the rusks to soak them, a strategy they say might improve its texture.The researchers say the behaviour requires impulse control and delayed gratification, and highlights the ingenuity of the birds in a food preparation context.\u201cBecause only some individuals dunked food and dunking has not been observed in the wild, we believe this to be a spontaneous foraging innovation either by one or multiple individuals,\u201d they write.Prof Simon Reader of McGill University in Montreal, who was not involved in the study but worked on dunking by wild Carib grackle birds, said it was surprising the behaviour had not been scientifically documented in parrots before.\u201cWe found that dunking was very rare in the wild in Carib grackles, but it was less innovative than we thought \u2013 virtually all birds could do it if you placed them in perfect conditions, with dry food, water, and away from the risk of the food being stolen,\u201d he said.\u201cLike these parrots, dunking seems to be something they employ depending on the costs and benefits at the time.\u201d",

        "text": "An area the size of Switzerland was cleared from Earth\u2019s most pristine rainforests in 2022, despite promises by world leaders to halt their destruction, new figures show.From the Bolivian Amazon to Ghana, the equivalent of 11 football pitches of primary rainforest were destroyed every minute last year as the planet\u2019s most carbon-dense and biodiverse ecosystems were cleared for cattle ranching, agriculture and mining, with Indigenous forest communities forced from their land by extractive industries in some countries.The tropics lost 4.1m hectares of primary rainforest in 2022, an increase of around 10% from 2021, according to figures compiled by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the University of Maryland. The report\u2019s authors warn that humans are destroying one of the most effective tools for mitigating global heating and halting biodiversity loss.Land use change is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions behind the burning of fossil fuels and is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels is unlikely without stopping the destruction of rainforests, according to scientists.Graphic showing loss of tree cover in South America, 2002 to 2022At Cop26 in 2021, more than 100 world leaders, including Joe Biden, Xi Jinping and Jair Bolsonaro, signed up to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030 in a commitment that covered more than 90% of the world\u2019s forests. The new data suggests that leaders are failing to deliver on their promise.Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Bolivia headed the table for tropical primary forest loss in 2022. Indonesia and Malaysia managed to keep rates of loss near record low levels after significant corporate and government action in recent years. Bolivia was one of the few big forested countries that did not sign the Cop26 commitment on stopping the loss.Ghana, a major producer of cacao for chocolate, has suffered the biggest relative increase in forest loss of any country in recent years, although the absolute figures are small.Away from the tropics, the loss of Russia\u2019s boreal forests slowed after a record year for destruction in 2021, but researchers said this was not an indication of a positive trend.Graphic showing how the world has lost more than 72m hectares of primary forest in the past 21 yearsIn response to the new figures, Inger Andersen, the UN\u2019s environment chief, has called for a higher price for forest carbon to eliminate the short-term economic incentive to clear rainforests. Through carbon markets, countries with forests that are critical to the climate \u2013 such as Gabon, Brazil and Peru \u2013 could receive payments to keep them standing, although there are doubts about their conservation success and ability to scale to the required size. In April, a report calculated that at least $130bn (\u00a3100bn) a year was needed to protect the most at-risk areas.\u201cForests are critical for our wellbeing and the wellbeing of planet Earth. Ending deforestation and halting forest cover loss are essential ingredients to fast-tracking climate action, to building resilience and to reducing loss and damage. We need to put a higher price on forest carbon, one that reflects the true value of forests, that reflects the actual cost of emissions and that is sufficient to incentivise the sellers to protect standing forests,\u201d Andersen said.Deforestation for agriculture, particularly cacao farming, near the Ghana-Togo border. Photograph: Muntaka Chasant/Shutterstock\u201cForest protection and forest restoration is about so much more than a carbon price. It is about protecting biodiversity; protecting the livelihoods of Indigenous people and local communities, and sustaining the hydrological cycle to stabilise weather patterns and protect ourselves against landslides, soil erosion and flooding. We simply cannot afford to lose more forest cover,\u201d she added.What is deforestation \u2013 and is stopping it really possible?Read moreThe 2022 figures cover the final year of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s presidency in Brazil, during which huge areas of the Amazon were cleared. Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, his successor, has promised to end deforestation and is holding a pan-Amazon summit later this year where the issue will be discussed.Brazil, Indonesia and the DRC, which are home to around half of the world\u2019s remaining rainforests, are increasingly working together at UN environmental talks to demand money for protecting forests in a coalition called the \u201cOpec of rainforests\u201d.The figures describe tree-cover loss, which is not necessarily deforestation. Deforestation is always done by humans while tree cover can be lost through wildfires and other events.

But they did not know who \u2013 or what \u2013 had created them.Scientists on the German research vessel Sonne set about hunting for clues. They sifted through several hundred images captured by a camera towed above the seafloor.The pictures revealed distinctive rows oval-shaped holes, each measuring roughly two or three centimetres \u2013 as if something had pogo-sticked a short way over the seabed. But the mystery remained \u2013 until now.The discovery happened by chance. Various animals were spied nearby and became suspects. \u201cMost things were pretty easy to exclude,\u201d says Julia Sigwart from the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum in Frankfurt. The holes were too small for sea urchins to fit into, and the wrong shape to be worm burrows.Then one of the team, Angelika Brandt, also from the Senckenberg Museum, noticed something: a little crustacean.\u201cAngelika jumps up, she points at the screen and says: \u2018It\u2019s that! That\u2019s the maker!\u2019 and then she ran out of the room,\u201d says Sigwart.A few moments later, Brandt returned with an external computer hard drive and showed everyone a video that had been shot 40 years earlier by a colleague. It was an amphipod \u2013 a relative of beach-dwelling sand hoppers \u2013 from Antarctica, filmed in captivity busily digging a burrow in the sand in its aquarium. Using its huge front appendages, it was carefully shovelling sand out of a hole and heaping it in a neat pile without letting it slide back in.A giant grenadier swims past the burrow, with a probable long-spined sea urchin inside the larger hole. Photograph: Wiley online libraryThe Antarctic amphipod looked a lot like the one Brandt spotted in the Bering Sea. \u201cWhen I saw the animal sitting in that hole, it was really a deja vu moment,\u201d she says.The Bering Sea amphipods have yet to be caught making the holes, but Brandt and colleagues think they are probably eating sediment in nutrient-rich layers of the seabed, and digging tunnels as they go.If they are anything like their Antarctic cousins, these 2cm-long crustaceans could also be using the burrows to breed. Female amphipods have pouches in which they raise their young. After they are born, the larvae don\u2019t float away like the offspring of many sea creatures do, but can stay in their parents\u2019 burrows for weeks or even months.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

At that scale, a 30cm-long burrow is a mountain. \u201cIf you\u2019re tiny, then even small changes in topography would have a massive impact on your habitat and how you interact with your environment,\u201d she says.The discovery has given scientists hope that they might make progress deciphering the many other mysterious marks in the mud at the bottom of the ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much activity there is in and on the seafloor.

The true figure is likely significantly higher, as reservoir data for tens of thousands of smaller dams is not available.Land submerged by dams is in addition to more than 2bn acres \u2013 the equivalent of 97% of tribal territory taken through treaties, laws, purchases, violence and coercion since the arrival of colonial settlers more than 500 years ago.\u201cThis is the first study to quantify tribal land flooded by dams, which is an overlooked and additional source of Native land dispossession,\u201d said the lead author Heather Randell, assistant professor of rural sociology and demography at Penn State University. \u201cThere was a lot of immediate trauma caused by the flooding and many long term impacts for tribal members that continue today.\u201dThere are more 90,000 6ft or taller dams in the US, of which 2% are megadams rising over 100ft, according to the Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 data. Large, federally-owned dams \u2013 such as the Hoover dam which created Lake Mead \u2013 proliferated in the mid-20th century during a different climate, with multiple functions such as flood control, electricity generation and diverting water supplies for irrigation.Dams are not harmless. Previous studies have shown that worldwide as many as 80 million people have been displaced by dams, while an additional 472 million people living downstream have had their family lives and livelihood disrupted \u2013 including many Indigenous Americans in Oregon, Oklahoma, Minnesota, the Dakotas and Arizona.Negative impacts can include flooded homes and farmland, as well as decimated traditional food sources such as salmon populations.Overall, the study found 139 dams have flooded land on 56 federal reservations, while another 287 dams have flooded land on 19 Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Areas (OTSAs) \u2013 locations in present-day Oklahoma that were established for tribes during the era of forced removal.The land lost varied from dam to dam, but submerged on average 3% of the total reservation. In New York, the Kinzua dam flooded almost one-third of the Allegany Reservation, while the Pick-Sloan Plan \u2013 a federal infrastructure project in the Missouri River basin for flood control and economic development \u2013 included five large dams that flooded over 350,000 acres on seven reservations in North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Activists and climate experts are vowing to step up their campaign to halt a huge new oilfield in the North Sea, which is expected to be given official approval in the coming days.The Rosebank project is three times bigger than the controversial Cambo field that was put on hold more than a year ago and has the potential to produce 500m barrels of oil, which when burned would emit as much carbon dioxide as running 56 coal-fired power stations for a year.It is expected to be signed off by the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, after Rishi Sunak hinted last month that it would be \u201ceconomically illiterate\u201d not to invest in UK oil and gas because Britain will remain reliant on fossil fuels for \u201cthe next few decades\u201d.However, this week the government\u2019s climate advisers said pushing ahead with the new fossil fuel development in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence was \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d.Tessa Khan, from the campaign group Uplift, said if the project was given approval they would step up their campaign, targeting \u201call those who are enabling it\u201d including the Norwegian government and the banks and insurers that are behind the project.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to demand that ministers put our interests ahead of profiteering oil and gas companies \u2026 nor fight this government for a safe climate and clean energy that everyone can afford. We shouldn\u2019t have to but we will.\u201dPublic opposition to the project has been building over the past year with hundreds of climate scientists and academics and more than 200 organisations from the Women\u2019s Institute to Oxfam joining tens of thousands of people across the UK.Recent protests have included a \u201cwave of resistance\u201d, in which hundreds of people took to the sea and local beaches in boats and kayaks, on paddleboards and in diving gear to highlight concerns about its potential impact on Britain\u2019s marine life and climate.Climate activists say they \u201chave strong grounds to believe that an unconditional approval of Rosebank would be unlawful\u201d.Khan added: \u201cGrant Shapps was told by his own climate advisers just this week that approving Rosebank is incompatible with maintaining a safe climate. It\u2019s that simple. Add to that the fact that UK taxpayers will cover 90% of the costs of Rosebank\u2019s development, while it won\u2019t make the slightest difference to our energy bills as it\u2019s mainly oil for export, and there is no rational case for allowing it to proceed.\u201dThe International Energy Agency warned before the UK-hosted Cop26 climate summit in 2021 that no new oil and gas exploration should take place if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.

The driver, also a member of the local fire service, drove the truck to the Benalla fire station to have the fire put out.\u201cIt was quick thinking and the fact that it hadn\u2019t gone any further into the truck that saved it from doing any serious damage,\u201d Cooper said.\u201cNo battery-operated e-waste should ever go into your landfill bin or the recycling bin,\u201d the Benalla mayor, Bernie Hearn, said. \u201cWhen people dispose of their vapes, they should take the batteries out and dispose of the batteries properly.\u201dPip Kiernan, the head of Clean Up Australia, said consumers should not be left to navigate the complexities of how local councils classify the waste.\u201cIt\u2019s a mess and it\u2019s no wonder they are ending up as litter. There is an urgent need for national consistency. It shouldn\u2019t be this hard.\u201dKiernan wants a mandatory solution that forces responsibility on to the vaping industry and favours something like the highly successful container deposit schemes in place around the country.\u201cThe consumer pays 10c when they buy a drink, and they get it back when they return the beverage container. So there\u2019s a cash incentive for consumers to do it, and it\u2019s very clear how to do it.\u201cAnd in that instance, the beverage companies are responsible for that \u2013 financially.\u201dA report by the NSW environmental watchdog last year said vape sales had climbed from $28.3m in 2015 to $98.1m in 2020.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last month, the government pledged to introduce new legislation to ban non-therapeutic and disposable single use vapes domestically.\u201cWe will continue working with state, territory and local governments on better managing waste,\u201d Plibersek said.Policies and regulations on waste are the responsibility of state and territory governments but the federal government can take a leadership role.It has done that in the past, helping state and territory environment ministers lock in reforms to ensure packaging waste is minimised and that, where it is used, it is designed to be recovered, reused, recycled or reprocessed.E-cigarettes can also contain carcinogens and toxic heavy metals that pose an issue if they leach from landfill into soil and waterways.The Queensland parliament\u2019s health and environment committee recently tested 17 e-liquids available from retailers around the state.Every sample contained nicotine, toxic heavy metals including arsenic, lead, mercury and chromium, and known carcinogens such as formaldehyde.",

Before 2013, scientists had never recorded three consecutive years of such high CO2 growth.Atmospheric CO2 is now 50% higher than pre-industrial levels.The 2022 methane rise was the fourth-largest since records began in 1983, following record growth in 2021 and 2022, and now stands at an average of 1,912 parts per billion (ppb). Methane is a potent greenhouse gas less abundant than CO2 but which warms the Earth\u2019s atmosphere much faster, and today is responsible for about 25% of the heat trapped by all greenhouse gases.Methane levels in the atmosphere are now more than two and a half times their pre-industrial level. The oil and gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane, which can also cause medical complications, fires and even engine failure leading helicopters to fall out of the sky.Levels of nitrous oxide, the third-most significant anthropogenic greenhouse gas, are now 24% higher than pre\u2013industrial levels, following a 1.25ppb rise last year.Fossil fuel-powered vehicles (cars, buses, trucks, farm machinery) are a major source of nitrous oxide, which is harmful to human health and water sources. But the primary culprits behind rising nitrous oxide levels in recent decades have been synthetic fertilisers and livestock manure from industrialised agriculture.\u201cThe observations collected by Noaa scientists in 2022 show that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at an alarming pace and will persist in the atmosphere for thousands of years,\u201d said Rick Spinrad, the Noaa administrator.\u201cThe time is now to address greenhouse gas pollution and to lower human-caused emissions as we continue to build toward a Climate-Ready Nation.\u201dScientists have been warning of catastrophic consequences for decades, yet meaningful climate action to cut fossil fuel use and other harmful human activities has been delayed and blocked, in large part due to the influence of industries such as oil and gas, agriculture, defence and automobiles.Last month, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, delivered a \u201cfinal warning\u201d on rising greenhouse gas emissions that have pushed the world to the brink of irrevocable damage that only swift and drastic action can avert.The stark warning came a week after the Biden administration approved the multi-decade Willow drilling project in Alaska, which will generate millions of additional tons of greenhouse gas emissions.",

A 350,000-signature petition called on the park authority to issue a traffic regulation order restricting access. There was a concerted lobbying effort on the other side, led by the Motoring Organisations\u2019 Land Access and Recreation Association.In October the national park decided to continue allowing recreational multipurpose vehicles. Officers ignored a recommendation from the International Council on Monuments and Sites, which advises Unesco on protecting world heritage sites. It said the vehicles had a negative impact on the \u201cability of the landscape to reflect its aesthetic and historic qualities\u201d.Now the Green Lanes Environmental Action Movement (Gleam) is seeking a judicial review of the national park\u2019s decision not to issue an order, which it describes as \u201can attack on the beauty and tranquility of one of the loveliest places in this world heritage site\u201d.A Land Rover on a green lane in Little Langdale.

        "text": "This group of women are the first female beekeepers in their town. Their work began in 2018 after they arrived at the Ximenes settlement, in the municipality of Barreiros in Pernambuco state in north-eastern Brazil. They had been displaced from their homes because of the expansion of the Suape port area farther north.The new settlement provided by the government is surrounded by a huge sugar cane plantation. The soil is unproductive, and pesticides threaten the native bees. There are no paved roads, schools or health centres in the area. Housing is precarious and the area is often flooded by the river.With few options for planting, the women turned to the local university to learn how to keep bees. Prof Renata Val\u00e9ria Gomes, from the zootechnics department at the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, provided the protective suits and hives and taught them beekeeping techniques to produce quality honey, free of pesticides. Until then beekeeping in the municipality was exclusively undertaken by men.Added to the financial independence they got by selling honey, the women pushed for a new sustainable dynamic in the community. To attract more bees, they began to plant crops around their homes using techniques passed down by their ancestors, transforming their back yards into oases with flowers, trees and crops. They combine genetic improvement techniques with ancestral knowledge to find sustainable ways of producing honey.I photographed this project in 2021, during the pandemic, and by watching these women who improved their lives by taking care of bees and also their surroundings, I was encouraged to think about a future with other possibilities, in which we don\u2019t have to destroy to survive.I felt some kind of hope, not an innocent hope that just waits for better days, but a kind of hope that shows us that we already have within our reach, the tools and resources to establish cooperative projects that are in tune with the rhythms of nature and life itself.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Her StageFree monthly newsletterHear directly from incredible women from around the world on the issues that matter most to them \u2013 from the climate crisis to the arts to sportEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Squatting in the strandline as a storm brewed on the horizon, I combed through the debris with tweezers. I spotted my first nurdle almost immediately. Covered in sand, the pale plastic pellet blended almost perfectly into the background. Next to me, a woman scraped the top layer of sand away and plopped it in a bucket of seawater. As she stirred, several nurdles drifted to the surface.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to make a dent,\u201d I thought. Despite removing more than 3,000 pieces of microplastic during our cleanup, thousands more winked at us from the sand as we left Camber Sands beach. These tiny pre-production plastic pellets, called nurdles, are littering UK beaches in such numbers that beach cleanups can\u2019t keep up.\u201cI think removing all the nurdles would be an impossible task. They\u2019re everywhere,\u201d says Andy Dinsdale, the founder of the East Sussex-based environmental organisation Strandliners.Nurdles are tiny plastic pellets \u2013 around the size of a lentil \u2013 made from fossil fuels, which are used to make plastic products. Huge containers of them are transported around the world by road, rail and ship before they are melted down and made into all the plastic items we use in our day-to-day lives.Nurdles are tiny pellets that are melted down to make plastic products. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty ImagesChristy Leavitt is the plastics campaign director at the conservation group Oceana. She agrees that removing all the plastic pellets from our oceans and coastlines is \u201csimply not possible\u201d. Studies have shown there are more than 170tn plastic particles floating in the world\u2019s oceans.So, why even bother with cleanups? For Dinsdale and his team, cleanups help to gather data, to illustrate how bad the nurdle problem really is. Evidence from cleanups has led to legislation such as the plastic bag tax and a ban on single-use items such as cotton buds.Nurdles: the worst toxic waste you\u2019ve probably never heard ofRead moreOrganising them without recording the data would mean \u201cwe\u2019ll be doing that for the rest of our lives\u201d, says Beverley Coombs, a Strandliners volunteer. \u201cIf you just pick, bag and bin, nobody knows what the rubbish is. How on earth can you stop it coming back?\u201dNurdle spills can occur when cargo ships capsize or drop containers overboard to preserve life during stormy seas \u2013 something allowed by international maritime law. Once in the ocean, these pellets can kill marine life and have catastrophic effects on the environment.Dani Whitlock, a project officer at the Scottish charity Fidra says nurdle pollution rates are increasing despite voluntary industry measures that attempt to prevent it. She attributes these pellet spills to mismanagement, poor handling and lack of accountability.Since the beginning of last year, there have been four major reported pellet spills across the world \u2013 with millions washing up in France, India, Dubai and Spain. And Fidra\u2019s annual Great Nurdle Hunt reports finding pellets in 93% of all its surveys. \u201cThese voluntary measures are not working,\u201d says Whitlock.A small sample of the nurdles collected from Camber Sands. Photograph: StrandlinersLeavitt says the problem needs to be dealt with at source, \u201cand that\u2019s at the production level\u201d. About 15m tonnes of plastic waste is poured into our oceans each year. \u201cThat\u2019s roughly equivalent to dumping two garbage trucks full of plastic into the ocean every minute,\u201d she says. Once this plastic waste reaches the ocean, it is incredibly difficult to remove.While many members of the public are doing their best to reduce their own plastic waste, governments and plastic-producing companies need to be the ones to solve nurdle pollution. Producing less plastic and regulating its discharge into waterways is much more effective than trying to clean up the mess after plastic pollution has already reached the ocean.It\u2019s \u201cone of the most straightforward plastic problems we have because there is a solution\u201d, says Whitlock. Better legislation, regulation and independent supply chain audits globally \u2013 including labelling nurdles as hazardous so they are treated with care during transport \u2013 could reduce pellet pollution by about 95%, she says.Dinsdale doesn\u2019t understand why plastic-producing companies aren\u2019t interested in protecting their raw materials. \u201cThey\u2019re losing money. It\u2019s in their own interest not to lose it,\u201d he says.Whitlock agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s just mind-boggling that we\u2019re not working towards that solution together.\u201dIn the meantime, Dinsdale and beachcombers like him aren\u2019t planning on stopping their hunts. If their efforts only involved cleanups, it might be a different story: \u201cThat would be depressing because you would never end,\u201d he says.But gathering evidence on the state of nurdle pollution gives conservation organisations more power to lobby for change, Dinsdale says. \u201cWe might be small in the grand scheme of things but we\u2019re helping in a proactive way rather than a reactive way.\u201d",

This has created a hazard outside a school and an eyesore for us all. Please RT in support of safer neighbourhoods. pic.twitter.com/dKFDsQkbNT\u2014 Dr Simon Cathcart (@drsimonc) July 16, 2021\nFive LTNs are in place across the borough as part of a trial intended to discourage car use for shorter local trips and to reduce traffic flow along smaller residential streets, and the associated signs and infrastructure have been repeatedly vandalised.Lambeth council said it would install more CCTV cameras and increase police and council patrols. Danny Adilypour, its joint lead on sustainable transport and environment, said: \u201cPeople are entitled to express their views over our low-traffic neighbourhood trials, but there is no excuse for acts of criminal vandalism which put our residents at risk and this is not an effective way to engage with the council or fellow residents.\u201dThe council also said vandalism could extend the duration of the schemes by causing delays.In recent months, LTNs have become a highly contested issue, prompting occasional demonstrations and accusations that some schemes, installed during the peak of the coronavirus lockdown, were put in place without sufficient consultation.Councils say they are necessary in part to unclog residential roads increasingly used as rat runs, often by drivers directed by navigation apps. Government figures show traffic on such roads has doubled since 2008.While some academic studies suggest that, given enough time, properly implemented LTNs do gradually reduce amounts of motor traffic rather than redirecting it, opponents say this is not the case and that they can also delay emergency services.Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, an air quality campaigner whose nine-year-old daughter Ella became the first person in the UK to have air pollution listed as a cause of death, has frequently voiced her opposition to LTNs. She has questioned whether it is \u201cmorally right\u201d to funnel more traffic on to main roads.She told the Times last year: \u201cMain roads in urban areas are not motorways \u2026 lots and lots of people live on these roads that are already gridlocked. And lots of children that live in these areas have respiratory issues. Is it morally right to add more traffic to those roads? We have to ask that question.\u201dA series of councils, including Lambeth, are running consultations into the schemes. Adilypour said this would \u201cgive everyone a chance to have their say in a fair, reasoned way\u201d.Last month, the high court rejected a legal attempt on behalf of a Lambeth resident against a local LTN.While many opponents of LTNs say they are widely unpopular, evidence for this is limited. Polling has shown generally broad support, while in May\u2019s local elections a handful of anti-LTN candidates stood in byelections for London councils and attracted minimal support.However, the noise generated by protests, and the accompanying media coverage, has persuaded some councils to rip out their LTNs.",

        "text": "The Spanish government has approved a \u20ac2.2bn (\u00a31.9bn) plan to help farmers and consumers cope with an enduring drought that has been exacerbated by the hottest and driest April on record.The measures, described as unprecedented by the government, were signed off by the cabinet on Thursday. They include \u20ac1.4bn of funds from the environment ministry to tackle the drought and increase the availability of water, and \u20ac784m from the agriculture ministry to help farmers maintain production and avoid food shortages.The plan came a day after the Socialist-led coalition government announced legislation that will mean outdoor workers such as refuse collectors, street sweepers and builders will not have to work when the Spanish meteorological office issues high temperature alerts. The move follows the deaths of a street sweeper and a leaflet delivery man during last July\u2019s heatwave in the Madrid region.Spain\u2019s environment minister, Teresa Ribera, said her department would spend \u20ac1.4bn on building new infrastructure such as desalination plants; on doubling the proportion of water that is reused in urban areas from 10% to 20% by 2027; and on subsidising those whose irrigation water supplies would be reduced.She said: \u201cSpain is a country that is used to periods of drought but there\u2019s no doubt that, as a consequence of the climate change we\u2019re experiencing, we\u2019re seeing far more frequent and intense events and phenomena.\u201cAnd we need to prepare for that by taking advantage of all the technical capacity that Spain has accrued and developed over many years. We need to deal with episodes such as the present one \u2013 and that requires planning, structural measures and also, obviously, short-term and immediate help plans.\u201dRibera said promising more water was not the answer, stressing that investments had to be made to manage demand and drive efficient use of the resource.The agriculture minister, Luis Planas, said most of the \u20ac784m promised by his ministry would go on direct help to livestock and grain farmers, who would also receive tax breaks.He said: \u201cThe main objective is to secure the productive continuity of our primary sector \u2013 of our crop and livestock farmers \u2013 so that they can produce food, which is a fundamental element when it comes to providing for our citizens, but which is also very important when it comes to food prices.\u201dWhile the government said it had approved the measures in response to the drought, high temperatures and the war in Ukraine, the opposition conservative People\u2019s party (PP) accused it of trying to con voters as Spain prepares to vote in regional and municipal elections on 28 May.The PP\u2019s leader, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, said the government had responded too late to the water shortage and called instead for an urgent meeting of regional presidents and the creation of a national water authority to oversee improvements to infrastructure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The legislation, proposed by the PP and the far-right Vox party, will also serve as an amnesty for the strawberry farmers who have already sunk illegal wells there.While all of Spain has been in drought since January 2022, water supplies in Catalonia have fallen so low that authorities introduced laws in March including a 40% reduction in water to be used for agriculture, a 15% reduction for industrial uses, and a cut in the average daily supply per inhabitant from 250 litres to 230 litres.",

A week on from the start of the flooding the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) called for urgent funding to scale up assistance, while the Somali Disaster Management Agency distributed aid to displaced families this week.Somalia is suffering the effects of the worst drought in four decades, a result of the climate crisis. But OCHA Southern and Eastern Africa warned that the recent precipitation will not counter the devastation caused by years of below-average rainfall.In 2019, local people built a defensive wall on the banks of the Shabelle, which has helped prevent flooding during previous heavy rains but could not withstand the force of the water this time.Like many members of his community, Ali fled to a relative\u2019s home, where he is sharing a room with two other displaced families.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be here with us to know how difficult it is when you have three families sharing a single room, not knowing when you\u2019ll return home and if the floods left anything behind,\u201d he said.People walk through flood water this week in Beledweyne.

After resettling my family, I returned home to take whatever I could but it started getting close to dusk, so I made the decision to spend the night there.\u201cThe water level was at my toes initially, but by the time I woke up the following morning, it was knee high. That\u2019s when I knew things would be different this time. I\u2019ve witnessed six floods since moving here in 1997 and this is the worst.\u201cMy children are still very young. Sometimes I wonder if they understand that they\u2019ve become displaced and that this empty home might become our permanent home,\u201d added Abdi, who is unemployed and depends on remittances from siblings in the diaspora to support his family. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything my siblings can do for my family.

The eastern parts of the country have experienced extremely unsettled weather over the last few days, with frequent spells of heavy rain.On Christmas Eve the city of Ladysmith to the north-east of Lesotho experienced flash flooding after a sudden deluge during the evening. Amateur weather stations in the area suggested about 60mm of rain fell within an hour, while in a three-hour period there was about 80mm of rainfall. The average rainfall in Ladysmith for the whole of December is just over 100mm.There was significant damage to infrastructure in the area, with one house and several vehicles swept away. Three vehicles were travelling on a major highway at the time and were washed away when a nearby river burst its banks, with water then flowing on to the road. One of these was a minibus carrying nine people, three of whom were later found dead inside, while the other six remain missing. In total, six deaths have so far been confirmed because of the floods, with search and rescue teams currently searching for 10 more people.Conditions remain unsettled in the region, with heavy rain and thunderstorms on Boxing Day disrupting a cricket test match between South Africa and India. However, while rain and showers in western parts are expected to turn lighter over the coming days, central parts of South Africa are expected to experience significant heavy rain, with the potential for further intense showery downpours.A rainy Christmas Day in Vancouver, where gusts of wind exceeded 100km/h. Photograph: Ethan Cairns/APMeanwhile, Vancouver has had stormy weather over the Christmas period that resulted in ferry cancellations and considerable power outages. During Christmas Eve stormy conditions occurred across northern areas of Vancouver with gusts exceeding 100km/h (62mph) for northern Vancouver Island overnight into Christmas Day. This resulted in power outages affecting about 8,000 on the island early on Tuesday, while a further 2,500 were affected by a power outage in Saanich. The winds were so strong that ferries had to be cancelled, and some are still not running. Further strong winds are still expected, with gusts potentially reaching up to 120km/h on Vancouver Island before easing. This article was amended on 2 January 2024 because an earlier version referred to the weather in western parts of South Africa; in fact the heavy rains hit eastern parts most strongly.",

Now a sound expert is listening into the quiet grove in an attempt to hear its secrets.Known as Pando \u2013 Latin for \u201cI spread\u201d \u2013 the 47,000 genetically identical quivering aspens in south-central Utah are considered to be a single organism, with the \u201ctrees\u201d actually branches thought to be connected by a shared root system.The upshot is a vast living entity, thought to be thousands of years old, that covers 43 hectares (106 acres) with a dry weight of about 6m kg, making it, putatively, the Earth\u2019s heaviest living organism. But it is also an organism in danger, with experts warning Pando is probably dying off due to human actions.Now an acoustic artist has revealed how he has delved deep to uncover fresh insights into the tree.\u201cThis project began with a question: what is the sound of one of the world\u2019s largest organisms,\u201d said Jeff Rice, a sound artist, in the presentation at the 184th meeting of the Acoustical Society of America in Chicago.The endeavour was initially an art project, with Rice working in collaboration with Lance Oditt, the founder of the nonprofit group Friends of Pando.\u201cI recorded pretty much everything that I could possibly record,\u201d Rice said in an interview with the Guardian, adding that this included the leaves, birds, foxes, and even the sound of ants moving over the branches.Looking for new ways of listening to the tree, Rice \u2013 who is artist-in-residence for Friends of Pando \u2013 placed a hydrophone inside a hole at the base of one of the branches, and lowered it down to touch the roots.\u201cIt was just an experiment, and I honestly didn\u2019t think I would get anything,\u201d he said.When he put on his headphones, he was in for a surprise.In one recording, made during a thunderstorm , an eerie, deep rumbling can be heard.\u201cWhat you\u2019re hearing I think, is the sound of millions of leaves in the forest, vibrating the tree and passing down through the branches, down into the earth,\u201d Rice said in his presentation.Fascinated by the approach, the pair carried out an impromptu experiment: Oditt pounded on one branch of Pando while Rice monitored the sound at the roots of another branch, about 100ft away.\u201cWhat we were doing was not science. This was just sort of exploration,\u201d Rice said.While Oditt\u2019s pounding was not audible through the air, a thump was detected through the hydrophone. \u201cThat suggests that there\u2019s a connection between these different branches in terms of the sound,\u201d said Rice. \u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing is not just this one branch that we\u2019re listening to but many branches around us.\u201dHowever, the results do not necessarily provide evidence of a connected root system, not least as the sound could be travelling through the soil.Prof Paul Rogers, an expert on Pando at Utah State University and who was not involved in the work, said it was not known for certain that the branches of Pando were connected by the root system, and welcomed Rice\u2019s acoustic work.\u201cHowever, it should be treated as an experiment at this time which needs to be demonstrated via strong scientific support,\u201d he said.For Rice, however, it seems his initial question has been answered.\u201cI think the sound of Pando is really the sound of all of the parts of it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the birds that are living in the tree, and it\u2019s the insects, and it\u2019s the wind in the leaves and it\u2019s the vibration of the earth and the potential sound of the roots. And so I see it as really a great way of understanding the interconnectivity of Pando, and also soundscapes in general.\u201d",

Other causes of pollution in the city are car emissions, construction and the burning of rubbish at waste plants.However, the pollution early warning systems in Delhi reportedly failed to predict the further rapid deterioration in conditions that took place late on Thursday.Delhi, home to about 33 million people, is regularly ranked the most polluted city in the world. According to this year\u2019s air quality life index, compiled by the University of Chicago\u2019s energy policy institute, the people of Delhi could have their lives shortened by 11.9 years due to the poor air they breathe.Doctors in Delhi said they had already begun to see the damaging impacts of pollution on the city\u2019s residents. \u201cThe number of patients with breathing problems has increased, with more people having coughs, colds, watery and irritated eyes, and breathing problems. People of all ages are affected by this.

Photograph: Kabir Jhangiani/NurPhoto/ShutterstockAccording to the central pollution control board, pollution levels in Delhi in October were at their worst since 2020.Despite the Delhi government, run by the Aam Admi party (AAP), insisting it has a pollution action plan, it appears there has been little impact on the sharp decline in air quality that blights the lives of Delhi residents every year, usually between November and January.Methods deployed by the AAP government to tackle pollution have included the sprinkling of water on roads to reduce dust and the building of two 80ft high \u201csmog towers\u201d, costing more than $2m each, that are supposed to clean the air but have been deemed by scientists to be largely ineffective.",

However, I would describe this as a teachable moment,\u201d said Moran, the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon.\u201cI hope schools, colleges and universities see this in the positive light it is meant and equally hope those students act sensibly with making sure adults know where they are and making up the missed work.\u201dBut the National Association of Head Teachers, which last week offered some support for those joining the strike, gave a more hard-headed assessment to its members as the day of the action approached.'Our house is on fire': Greta Thunberg, 16, urges leaders to act on climateRead more\u201cPupils should only be out of school in exceptional circumstances. Whilst NAHT supports the right of young people to express themselves, first and foremost, pupils should be in school during term time,\u201d the union said.\u201cWhile a school leader\u2019s role is to ensure children attend school, are kept safe and receive a good quality of education, it is right that individual school leaders can decide how best to respond to any proposed protest by students in their school on Friday.\u201dChris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said young people were right to be concerned about climate change but warned that teachers had genuine safeguarding issues to consider.\u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate for pupils to just walk out of school. The young people organising this are potentially putting themselves and others at risk by simply walking out of school,\u201d Keates said.\u201cTeachers take their responsibility for pupils welfare during the school day seriously and while they may have sympathy for the cause will not be able to condone pupils just walking out.\u201cA well-planned, accessible demonstration of young people at a weekend or during a holiday would enable thousands to participate and be a powerful protest.\u201dThe Department for Education\u2019s guidance says unauthorised absences must be recorded as part of safeguarding, but gives room for headteachers to approve absences in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d.The organisers have written form letters for the parents of those wanting to take part, which argue that protesting qualifies as civic engagement and climate change is an exceptional circumstance.With the strike taking place on the final day before half-term holidays in many parts of England, some schools may adopt a relaxed attitude. But others have already informed their students any absence will be noted as unauthorised.Geoff Barton, a former secondary school headteacher who now leads the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cWhile we understand the strength of feeling over the very important issue of climate change, we would urge pupils against walking out of school on Friday.\u201cIt is extremely disruptive for a school to have to deal with unauthorised absences and pupils will be missing out on important learning time.\u201dThe day of action follows the example of Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old Swedish schoolgirl who began protesting outside her country\u2019s parliament in August. Her solo effort has since grown and spread to countries around the world including Germany and Australia.In a letter to the Guardian, more than 200 UK academics said they offered \u201cfull support\u201d to the school strikers. \u201cThey have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them, if proportionate and urgent action is not taken,\u201d it said.",

The findings are \u201calarming\u201d, said Kristin Knox, a scientist at Silent Spring Institute and study co-author.\u2018Toxic trail of pollution\u2019: states step up to curb the use of \u2018forever chemicals\u2019Read more\u201cIt just highlights that there are a lot of products that people use every day that contain many of these harmful chemicals,\u201d she added.VOCs are a widely used class of chemicals that can detach from or are emitted from surfaces or products and move through the air. Many pose health risks and are carcinogenic, or bond with other chemicals to form air pollution.The study is the first analysis to make use of ingredient data that manufacturers are required to submit to the state of California\u2019s air resources board. Carb tracks VOCs in consumer products in an effort to reduce smog. In the presence of sunlight, VOCs react with other air pollutants to form ozone, the main ingredient in smog.However, the study was limited to VOCs, and many products can contain other chemicals that are not identified. The peer-reviewed research was conducted by the University of California, Berkley, and the Silent Spring Institute environmental non-profit.Overall, the research found more than 100 products with VOCs, and 30 \u2013 including a dozen different types of personal care products \u2013 that researchers say deserve special scrutiny because the goods frequently contain VOCs and may pose the greatest health risk. VOCs can be inhaled, ingested or absorbed through the skin, and many products contained more than one kind of the compounds.\u201cIt\u2019s not just one product at a time, like your dish detergent, it\u2019s the fact that we use multiple products every day and each of these products could have different [VOCs] in them, so all of this really adds up in our daily lives,\u201d said Robin Dodson, a scientist with Silent Spring Institute and study co-author.Among products used on the body, the most common VOC was formaldehyde, which was listed as an ingredient in nail polish, shampoo, makeup and other kinds of personal care items. Industry adds the substance to function as a preservative. Mothballs, meanwhile, emit about 300 tons of 1,4-dichlorobenzene, a likely carcinogen that comprises about 99% of the ingredients in the insect repellant, though Knox noted that safer alternatives, like cedar chips, exist.Among the most toxic ingredients was diethanolamine, which the EU has banned for use in cosmetics, but was found in 40 different US products, including cosmetics and personal care items. It is used as an emulsifier. \u201cThe fact that it is in so many products is kind of worrisome,\u201d Dodson said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Hair and nail salon workers are likely regularly subjected to about nine VOCs covered by Prop 65 that are added to nail polishes, nail polish removers, artificial nail adhesives, hair straighteners and other cosmetics. Janitors, meanwhile, could use a combination of general cleaners, degreasers, detergents and other maintenance products which could expose them to more than 20 VOCs covered by Prop 65.Consumers can take some steps to protect themselves, like reading labels and identifying dangerous chemicals, when possible, or using products outdoors.Researchers identified 11 VOCs they say manufacturers should eliminate from products because of their high toxicity, volatility and widespread use, and five that should be banned under the nation\u2019s toxic substances laws. The authors say they also hope California state regulators will use the analysis to identify priority products and chemicals that could be regulated more tightly in consumer goods.\u201cWe\u2019re handing them a couple of good ideas based on the analyses,\u201d Knox said.",

She has worked with experts to prepare the land for the beavers and build an enclosure for them to meet current licensing rules. She has also spoken to local farmers and residents about the beavers and the changes they could bring to the landscape.Welcome to wild Britain: the beavers are back and there\u2019s more to comeRead moreBeavers were hunted to extinction in Britain 400 years ago for their fur, glands and meat. They have begun to reappear after the government licensed beaver releases within enclosures, as well as illegal releases taking place around the country. Some experts suggests there are hundreds of beavers living wild along England\u2019s waterways.In 2022, beavers were given legal protection in England, making it illegal to kill or harm them as they are formally recognised as native wildlife. Environmentalists hope the upcoming beaver strategy will pave the way for this beloved rodent to be released to roam wild.Beavers are known as a \u201ckeystone species\u201d, because they create new wetlands that are used by other species, including dozens of bird and insect species.A growing body of evidence from reintroduction sites also shows that beaver dams slow the passage of water through landscapes, cutting flood risk downstream and also conserving water in times of drought.Lieu said she was thrilled to bring back beavers to Hampshire after 400 years. She said: \u201cIt has been a very rewarding journey learning about what beavers need, how they will impact the environment around them and the benefits that they will bring to other animals and plants.\u201cThese beavers are not just for Ewhurst, but for the whole community and local area for generations to come.\u201dDr Roisin Campbell-Palmer, the head of restoration at Beaver Trust, said: \u201cWe\u2019re really pleased to see another county providing a home for beavers as part of the species\u2019 restoration efforts across Britain.\u201cWe are working towards their continued return to the wild, with appropriate licensing and management frameworks, but in the meantime enclosures such as the one here at Ewhurst remain an important part of the restoration story.\u201d",

This comes despite the decline of the bird\u2019s population, with nearly 22 million house sparrows lost from the country since 1966.Roughly 1.5 million house sparrows were spotted in gardens between 27 and 29 January this year, according to people who took part in the Big Garden Birdwatch, the garden wildlife survey conducted by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB).However, RSPB data shows that the number of house sparrows spotted in UK gardens has dropped by nearly 60% since the survey began in 1979.\u201cThe numbers speak for themselves when it comes to the startling declines of some of our once common birds,\u201d said Beccy Speight, RSPB\u2019s chief executive.\u201cThey no longer have the abundance across the UK that they used to have.

It has sent tens of thousands of food parcels to communities isolated by the lack of river transport.The region is under pressure from the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, with the volume of rainfall in the northern Amazon below the historical average.The most serious problem for Indigenous communities that have no running water is sanitation now that the river water cannot be drunk, Apiam coordinator Mariazinha Bare said.\u201cThe smaller rivers have dried up and turned to mud,\u201d Bare said in an interview. \u201cIndigenous people have to walk long distances in the rainforest to find potable water, and the poor quality of water is making people ill,\u201d she said.Impassable rivers have made it harder for medical assistance to reach Amazon villages, Bare said, and rain is not expected until the end of November or early December when the rivers and their fish population normally renew themselves.The Madeira river to the south-west is no longer navigable in its upper reaches, isolating Indigenous villages and non-Indigenous communities that rely on collecting fruit in the rainforest but cannot move their produce out.Ivaneide Bandeira, who heads the Kaninde Indigenous organization in the state of Rondonia, said isolated non-Indigenous communities were asking Indigenous villages for food.She said the smoke from forest fires was worse than ever, aggravating the climate crisis and affecting the health of the elderly and children.\u201cIt is not just the El Ni\u00f1o current.

        "text": "Residents in areas of England affected by flooding have been urged to remain vigilant as two severe \u201cdanger to life\u201d warnings remained in place after heavy rainfall.They came as the Met Office issued yellow weather warnings for Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland which included predictions of heavy snow, gusty winds and the chance of the relatively rare phenomenon of thundersnow.Three back-to-back storms, Dudley, Eunice and Franklin, have combined over the past week to bring travel chaos, injury, power cuts, tree loss and flooding to parts of the UK. At least three people are known to have died as a result of Eunice.The worst of the weather appears over for now but anxiety remains high for flooded areas.The two severe flood warnings are in Bewdley, Worcestershire, and the historic village of Ironbridge, Shropshire.In Bewdley search and rescue teams were out checking properties and speaking to residents after temporary flood defences were breached after heavy rain on Tuesday afternoon.Barriers hold back flood water in Bewdley after storms and heavy rainfall caused the River Severn to rise. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesThe Environment Agency said the water level peaked on Wednesday lunchtime at 5.33m and levels are forecast to \u201cremain high for a prolonged period\u201d.Nick Green, area incident manager for the Environment Agency for the West Midlands, said it had been \u201cincredibly frightening\u201d for the community in Bewdley, which has faced regular flooding in recent decades.He said: \u201cWe could really see the anxiety and the worry that they had knowing that the river was going to rise and the impact that it could have on their lives.\u201dDan Bond, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said: \u201cWe are still facing a significant flooding risk, and we are urging people to remain vigilant and take extreme care.Q&AWhat is thundersnow?ShowThe Met Office says the phenomenon is meteorologically identical to the thunder and lightning storms that take place in summer, just with snow instead of rain or hail.This means it can look and sound different. Lightning reflecting off snowflakes appears brighter, and the thunder is muffled by snow drifts. During a summer storm, the thunder can be heard many miles away, but during a thundersnow event it will only be heard if you are within 2-3 miles of it.Thundersnow is rarer than regular thunderstorms, since elevated convection \u2013 moist air rising into the troposphere to produce thunderstorms \u2013 rarely happens at temperatures that support snowfall.Thunderstorms develop when a front of warm air collides with colder air making the atmosphere unstable. As warm air rises it cools and condenses, forming small droplets of water to create a cumulonimbus cloud in less than an hour. As the warm air continues to rise, the water droplets form ice crystals, and circulating air in the clouds causes water\u00a0 to freeze on the surface of the droplet or crystal. Eventually, the droplets become too heavy to be supported by the updraughts of air and they fall as hail. Lightning is formed when the negative charge of the hail rubs against smaller, positively charged ice crystals and they discharge in a flash of lightning. The rapid expansion and heating of air caused by the lightning produces the accompanying loud clap of thunder.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.\u201cLast weekend\u2019s heavy rainfall on already wet areas continues to cause river flooding along the River Severn and is likely to continue over the next few days.\u201dIn Ironbridge councillor Shaun Davies, leader of Telford and Wrekin Council, said the water was just 20cm away from breaching barriers. \u201cIt\u2019s only through the grace of God that these barriers have not been topped again.\u201dThe Met Office yellow warning for Scotland and Northern Ireland is in place between 5pm on Wednesday until 8pm Thursday.The warning has changed from snow and wind to snow and lightning. The latter means there is a chance of thundersnow,where snow dampens the sound of the thunder and reflects the lightning, making it seem brighter.All of the UK will feel colder on Thursday as a cold front sweeps through.The recent storms led to 1.48m households and businesses losing power. The Energy Networks Association said on Wednesday that 1,400 customers were still waiting for it to be restored.",

        "text": "Extreme heat contributed to as many as 450 deaths in the Phoenix area this summer, in what could be the deadliest year on record for the desert city in Arizona.The medical examiner for Maricopa county, which includes Phoenix, has so far confirmed 284 heat-related deaths, while investigations into 169 more suspected heat fatalities are ongoing. The highest number of deaths \u2013 and emergency hospital visits \u2013 coincided with the hottest days and nights.\u2018Getting harder and hotter\u2019: Phoenix fire crews race to save lives in America\u2019s hottest cityRead moreThe temperature hit 110F or higher on 22 days this year, yet it was only the 20th hottest summer on record, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). It did not drop below 80F on 75% of nights between June and August. Heat effects are cumulative and the body cannot begin to recover until the temperature drops below 80F.Overall, the suspected heat death toll is 36% higher than for the same period last year, despite a good rainy season which helped keep temperatures \u2013 and heat deaths \u2013 down from late July. And while heat will be ruled out in some cases, 2022 totals look to surpass last year\u2019s historic high.Bar chart of heat-related deaths in Maricopa county\u201cDeaths tend to increase during our hottest days, especially when combined with very warm nights,\u201d said Marvin Percha, a meteorologist with the NWS Phoenix. \u201cThe long-term increase in summertime temps seems to be playing at least some role in the increasing number of heat deaths over the years.\u201dPhoenix, the capital of Arizona and the country\u2019s fifth-largest city, with 1.6 million people, is accustomed to a hot desert climate, but temperatures are rising due to global heating and urban development, which has created a sprawling asphalt and concrete heat island that traps heat especially at night.In recent years, daily temperature highs have been smashed frequently and this year the city broke three daytime and nine night-time records. 911 calls for heat-related medical emergencies rose 13% compared with last year.Heat deaths are preventable, yet have doubled since 2016, and it\u2019s not just down to the heat.Phoenix is also one of the fastest growing and most expensive cities in the US, with a crippling shortage of affordable housing and a rapidly growing homeless population.According to the county\u2019s annual count, there were 5,029 people sleeping on the streets in January \u2013 triple the number of unsheltered people compared with 2016. Being outside without adequate shade and water increases the risk of medical complications and deadly heat exposure.Despite several new shelters opening this year, the situation has gotten even worse. Across the city, there are men and women sleeping rough in parks, parking lots and shop doorways, and behind dumpsters and along canals.Last week, outreach workers counted 1,006 people sleeping in tents, under makeshift shelters or on the ground in just one relatively compact downtown area known as the zone, where many of the city\u2019s shelters and homeless services are concentrated. On very hot days the temperature can reach 160F on the asphalt where people are camped.\u201cThere\u2019s lots of new energy and effort around long-term housing solutions, but big system pieces needed to end homelessness don\u2019t move quickly,\u201d said Amy Schwabenlender, executive director of the Human Services Campus in the zone.Eviction rates in Maricopa county are higher than pre-pandemic levels, and inflation hit 13% in Phoenix last month \u2013 a record for any US city according to data going back 20 years. One in five confirmed heat deaths this year occurred indoors, and initial reports suggest the soaring cost of living may have played a role as 80% of victims did not have functioning air conditioning.Still, this year\u2019s high death toll is alarming given the cooling seasonal rains and the city\u2019s first coordinated effort to reduce heat deaths, which involved more than a dozen agencies in addition to a gaggle of non-profits and grassroots activists.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about heat, it\u2019s a multifactorial problem that requires more coordination and creativity to line up the different pieces of the solutions portfolio,\u201d said David Hondula, who leads the city\u2019s \u2013 and North America\u2019s \u2013 first extreme heat office. \u201cMessaging alone won\u2019t help, nor will handing out water bottles or investing in housing alone.\u201dTackling the complex and interconnected issues that increase the risk of heat emergencies \u2013 lack of affordable housing, homelessness, substance misuse, inflation, inadequate shade and rising temperatures \u2013 will take time, money and political will.In the meantime, Hondula\u2019s heat team will be diving into the data from 2022 to figure out which services or interventions saved lives and should be expanded, and which should be reformed or scrapped.Hondula added: \u201cThis is not where we want to be; our goal is zero deaths.\u201d",

        "text": "Environmental campaigners are calling on the UK government to take action after new analysis found a significant difference between the carbon footprints of washable and disposable nappies.Reusable nappies have 25% less global heating potential compared with single-use nappies, according to a report commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).The environmental impact of production was shown to be nearly nine times greater for single-use nappies, and nearly 10 times greater when it came to their disposal.However, the report paints a mixed picture, with reusable nappies given a worse impact score for 11 of 18 categories \u2013 mainly associated with water and electricity usage when washing and drying.Reuse? Compost? Dump? Solving the eco-conundrum of nappiesRead moreDisposable nappies are one of the biggest single contributors to plastic waste worldwide, but a 2005 life cycle analysis declared there was \u201clittle or no difference between the environmental impact of reusable and disposable nappies\u201d.This resulted in a lack of action from policymakers, according to campaigners, who say the government has a responsibility to make it easier for parents to switch to reusables.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the British government be really bold on lots of stuff to do with single-use plastic,\u201d said Elisabeth Whitebread of the Nappy Alliance campaign group. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the first plastic packaging tax in the world, we\u2019ve recently seen them banning single-use plastic cutlery and plates, but by the number of items, as well as the weight and volume, nappies represent a much greater contribution to single-use plastic waste.\u201cThis clearly needs policy initiative but also awareness raising \u2013 so many people don\u2019t even think about nappies as a single-use plastic.\u201dHilary Vick, a founder of the washable nappy service Nappy Ever After, added: \u201cThe playing field is unequal because parents and carers have the task and the expense of washing nappies and the time it takes, and yet the disposal of nappies is free. They\u2019re readily available in supermarkets, which makes it seem normal \u2013 governments and local authorities have a responsibility to go against those norms.\u201dWhile Defra\u2019s report could be a significant step forward for the reusable industry, single-use nappies were only found to leave a worse impact in seven of the categories, including global heating potential, land use, fossil resource scarcity and water use in manufacturing. But campaigners say these effects are particularly critical in light of the climate crisis.Reusable nappies scored worse in areas including marine eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, mineral resource scarcity, marine ecotoxicity and water consumption. The main factors behind their effects are water, detergent and electricity use when washing and drying nappies, and flushing faeces.The report says parents can lessen their impact by using energy-efficient washing machines, air drying instead of tumble drying and passing nappies to a second child.The Absorbent Hygiene Product Manufacturers Association (AHPMA) pointed to a 28% reduction in the global heating potential of disposables since 2005, as improved technology had led to smaller nappies and fewer materials being used in production \u2013 the reduction for reusables was 38.5%The industry body suggested the difference in CO2 impact set out in the latest report was not as great as it might appear at first glance. It pointed to the report\u2019s comparison of 2.5 years in disposable nappies to 6.4 return car journeys from London to Nottingham (1,622 miles), compared with 4.8 journeys (1,223 miles) for reusables \u2013 amounting to a difference of 400 miles.\u201cThis should reassure parents and carers that both options represent responsible choices for babies, as they also consider performance, skin health benefits, and convenience when deciding on the best nappy option based on their individual family needs and lifestyles,\u201d the AHPMA added.A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to maximising resources and minimising waste, and are reviewing the findings of this analysis.\u201d",

        "text": "A substance found in hundreds of drinking water samples across England has been categorised as carcinogenic by the World Health Organization (WHO).The move will increase pressure on the UK government to take action on \u201cforever chemicals\u201d.Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is one of 10,000 or so chemicals within the family of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that are used in a wide range of products, from cosmetics to clothing and food packaging, as well as in industrial processes and in firefighting foams. PFOA and another member of the family, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), have largely been banned, but remain in the environment because of their persistence. Studies have linked the PFAS family of chemicals to cancers, immunodeficiencies, reproductive harms and developmental effects in children. They are not easily metabolised by the body so build up in humans and animals over time.PFOA has been linked to cancer for some time but a growing body of evidence means it has now been upgraded to \u201ccategory one\u201d, which means it is \u201ccarcinogenic to humans\u201d, according to the WHO\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).A recent report from the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) shows that approximately 12,000 samples taken from drinking water sources contain at least one PFAS of some kind.The highest concentration of PFOA detected in a drinking water source was 149 nanograms a litre (ng/l), 1.5 times the DWI\u2019s maximum limit for tap water. PFOS, categorised by the IARC as a \u201cpossible carcinogen\u201d, was found at levels as high as 1,869ng/l, although these levels will have been diluted before reaching a tap.Analysis of Environment Agency and water company data by Watershed Investigations showed that PFOA was detected in almost 1,000 drinking water sources sampled between 2006 and 2022. And tap water sampling around England found PFOA in more than half of the 45 samples taken, albeit below 10ng/l, deemed \u201clow risk\u201d by the DWI.Earlier this year, the Guardian and Watershed Investigations found that effluent from the site of a chemicals company flowing into a protected river in Lancashire contained \u201cextremely high levels\u201d of PFOA.The government has been accused of dragging its feet over taking action on PFAS compared with the EU, which is considering stricter regulation across all 10,000 or so of the substances.England is behind the EU on drinking water limits: the DWI allows up to 100ng/l for PFOA and PFOS, while the EU applies a limit of 100ng/l for the sum of 20 PFAS. Denmark has set a limit of just 2ng/l for four individual PFAS, and the US Environmental Protection Agency has proposed dropping limits on some to 4ng/l.Dr Patrick Byrne from Liverpool John Moores University, said: \u201cRecently the Royal Society of Chemistry called on the government to reduce the maximum allowable level of individual PFAS such as PFOA in drinking water from 100ng/l to 10ng/l. This is to bring the UK more in line with other countries such as the US, who are proposing a maximum allowable concentration for PFOA of 4ng/l.\u201cUK regulations and environmental standards must keep pace with the scientific and medical evidence to protect our drinking water and us.\u201dHannah Evans from the chemicals NGO Fidra said the categorisations were \u201cextremely alarming\u201d and highlighted the urgent need for regulatory action on PFAS. \u201cWe must take this opportunity to learn from cases such as PFOS and PFOA, and transition towards a PFAS-free economy as quickly and as effectively as possible.\u201dPhilippe Grandjean, professor and chair of environmental medicine at the University of Southern Denmark, said PFAS chemicals were \u201ctransferred from a pregnant mother through her placenta to her foetus, and they are excreted in her milk. Thus, a breastfed infant receives a relatively large dose \u2026 so we see abnormalities like elevated cholesterol and poor glucose metabolism in children with elevated PFAS exposures. In addition, the immune system is harmed. This has implications for infectious disease but may also be of importance for cancer development, where immune cells are supposed to remove abnormal cells.\u201dA Defra spokesperson said: \u201cDrinking water quality in England is of an exceptionally high standard and among the best in the world. Water companies are required to carry out regular risk assessments and sampling for any substance \u2013 including PFAS \u2013 that they believe may cause the water supply to pose a risk to human health.\u201cWork is continuing across government to help us assess levels of PFAS occurring in the environment, their sources and potential risks to inform future policy and regulatory approaches.\u201d",

Photograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyAnger continued to grow on Thursday over the nighttime felling of more than 100 trees by the Conservative-run Plymouth city council. The tree removal was carried out despite significant local opposition and ongoing lobbying of the council by the Woodland Trust.More than 16,000 people had signed a petition calling for the existing trees to be saved and incorporated into the new design for a pedestrian walkway leading from the sea to the city centre. A council survey carried out as part of community engagement revealed that 68% of respondents did not support its redevelopment plan; just 16% were in favour.Protections for trees are limited in England and Wales. Tree protection orders can be overridden by planning permission. Egan said councils were responsible for issuing them, despite often leading the developments which put the trees under threat in the first place.Britain\u2019s ancient yews: mystical, magnificent \u2013 and unprotectedRead moreItaly recently passed a law granting 20,000 trees legal protection as natural monuments. The Woodland Trust is exploring whether similar legislation could be pursued in the UK.\u201cWe are exploring how we can go about providing protections for trees which are similar to heritage buildings,\u201d said Egan. \u201cWe want to raise public awareness that will help push forward stronger legislation and are investigating what the best options are.\u201dIn Plymouth, the council moved in to fell the trees on Tuesday night, hours after a period of community engagement ended.

        "text": "Half of Britain and Ireland\u2019s native plants have declined over the past 20 years, with non-native species now more numerous in the wild, a major study has found.Thousands of botanists from the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI) have spent the past 20 years collecting data on changes in the British and Irish flora.The research, published in Plant Atlas 2020, has implications for native insects and other species which rely on the plants they evolved alongside.plant diversity graphsAgricultural practices and the climate crisis are the main drivers of decline in native plant species, scientists said, as they called for urgent action to tackle the loss.Changes in farming since the 1950s such as nitrogen enrichment, habitat degradation and changes in grazing pressure have led to the decline of species such as heather andharebell, the research found. Additionally, damp meadows have been drained, leading to substantial declines in plants such as devil\u2019s-bit scabious \u2013 a plant fed on by rare butterflies.introduced plant species mapAncient arable wildflowers such as corn marigold fared worse than other species; with a 62% decline. This is because traditional grasslands have been reseeded or over-fertilised.Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cThe decline of our beautiful native plants is heartbreaking and has consequences for us all. The loss of natural habitats due to modern farming methods over the last 70 years has been an unmitigated disaster for wildflowers and all the species that depend on them including insects, bats and birds.\u201cBut it\u2019s not too late to stop this catastrophe. The government\u2019s new farm environment schemes must do what was originally promised and reverse the decline of nature in our agricultural landscape. Also, protection for local wildlife sites needs to be increased, and the promise made by the government at the recent UN biodiversity summit to halve nutrient pollution by 2030 must be honoured.\u201dClimate breakdown has affected many species. For example, mountain plants such as alpine lady-fern, alpine speedwell and snow pearlwort depend on areas where the snow lies late in the spring and summer.Of the 3,445 different plant species recorded during fieldwork, 1,692 are native to Britain while 1,753 non-natives were found that have been deliberately or accidentally introduced into the wild by humans. Many of the non-native species originate from gardens and then spread to establish self-sustaining populations. The planting of non-native spruce is degrading peatland habitats, researchers found, and sitka spruce, which regenerates into peatland and moorland, has shown the most significant increase in range of any species recorded.sitka spruce graphicDr Kevin Walker, BSBI head of science and Plant Atlas 2020 co-author, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can do to reverse these declines, but the most important are to increase the protection plants receive, extend the habitat available to them, and to place their needs at the very heart of nature conservation. We also need to ensure that our land, water and soil are managed more sustainably so that plants, and the species which rely upon them for food and shelter, can thrive.\u201d",

It is courage and leadership that we need now,\u201d they said.\u201cIn the past, we have mobilised many of our members collectively with extraordinary results, and our resolve to stand firm now against any and all attacks on this critical policy agenda remains absolute.\u201dTheir warning comes after the Conservative party narrowly succeeded in holding on to the safe Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat in the byelection triggered by the former prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s departure from the Commons.The constituency\u2019s Conservative candidate, Steve Tuckwell, centred his campaign on opposition to the planned expansion of London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which is designed to reduce vehicle pollution in the capital, but which has also become a rallying point for opponents of the Labour London mayor, Sadiq Khan.The result led some to suggest that there was political capital to be made for Tories concerned about the party\u2019s disastrous polling in exploiting so-called local wedge issues.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is, therefore, with deep alarm that we have read reports over the last few weeks of your government considering watering down its commitments on almost every front of environmental policy,\u201d they told Sunak.Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Saturday, the Woodland Trust\u2019s chief executive, Darren Moorcroft, said it was \u201cincumbent\u201d on them to act. He said signatories to the letter would not be shy in speaking out in the run-up to the general election.\u201cWe will make our voices heard with regard to how people should view any political party as it runs into the general election on what it is doing for the environment. So, instead of backtracking on environmental policies, we believe every political party that\u2019s serious about winning should be setting out plans to get those good green jobs, to get cleaner air and seas, to restore our natural environment.\u201dThe letter will also serve as a warning to the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who reacted to his party\u2019s failure to secure Uxbridge and South Ruislip by urging Khan to \u201dreflect\u201d on the planned extension of Ulez.",

Everyone was watching when I returned to the beach but they didn\u2019t know that what I had in my hands was ambergris.\u201dAcademics inspecting the dead sperm whale in Las Palmas. Photograph: Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran CanariaAmbergris is a rare substance, often known as floating gold, that has been the holy grail of perfumers for centuries. The lump Fern\u00e1ndez held in his hand was worth about \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3430,000).The origin of ambergris, produced by about one in 100 sperm whales, was only solved when large-scale whaling began in the early 19th century. Whales eat large quantities of squid and cuttlefish, most of which cannot be digested and is vomited out. But some remains, and over the years binds together in the whale\u2019s intestines to form ambergris.This is sometimes excreted, which is why ambergris is most commonly found floating in the sea. But sometimes, as in the case of the whale in La Palma, it grows too large, rupturing the intestine and killing the whale.Ambergris has a woody scent like sandalwood but also contains ambrein, an odourless alcohol that can fix and extend the life of scents, hence its popularity among perfumers.Ambergris extracted from the bowel of a dead sperm whale on the island of La Palma Photograph: Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran CanariaThe US, Australia and India have banned the trade in ambergris as part of the ban on hunting and exploiting whales.Fern\u00e1ndez, who has conducted autopsies on more than 1,000 whales, said sepsis caused by the ambergris killed the whale.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "In this book \u2026 Already, three words into my review, this most straightforward way of beginning seems inaccurate, ham-fisted. Is this a book? Verdant Inferno/A Scabby Black Brazilian is published by Urbanomic, whose stated aim is \u201cto act as an advocate for philosophical thinking as a creative practice\u201d. It is among the first titles in a new series, K-Pulp Switch, which borrows the format and the look of the popular Ace Doubles books, launched in 1952, in which two works would be published together, back-to-back and top-to-toe, so that the reader could hold the volume either way up. These two titles are published in this same format, with a pleasingly lurid cover design that recalls the garish frontispieces of the sci-fi and western novels that made up the original series, by authors including Philip K Dick and Ursula K Le Guin.Rangel\u2019s half is the more accessible. His sense of the seething beauty and violent horror of Amazonia is rivetingThe contents of this new volume are, however, very different from these classics of genre fiction. Verdant Inferno is a collection of short pieces by the Brazilian writer Alberto Rangel, published in 1908 and translated into English here for the first time, with a preface by the renowned journalist Euclides da Cunha; it comprises a series of overwhelmingly intense, captivating and often horrifying snapshots of Amazonian life, human and non-human. A Scabby Black Brazilian is harder to characterise. Originally written in 2017 by the French philosopher Jean-Christophe Goddard, it is a dense and impish blurring of fiction, alternative history and high literary theory. He brings in and weaves together a head-spinning range of times, places and names: Brazilian novelists, anthropologists and shamans, and European philosophers who visited or wrote about Brazil. Real and fictional figures rub shoulders; languages and worlds swallow and regurgitate one another, producing what Goddard calls \u201ca swarm of polyglot\u2026 words, names and phrases\u201d.There is, to say the least, a lot going on in this relatively slim volume \u2013 in this (these?) book(s?). Rangel\u2019s half is the more accessible. His sense of the seething beauty and violent horror of Amazonia is riveting, full of haunting images, such as his description of the apuizeiro, the strangler fig tree, \u201can octopus in plant form\u201d, which envelops and consumes other plants: \u201cevery one of its microscopic cells takes the form of a thirsty mouth. And the whole struggle takes place silently, without a whisper\u201d. Goddard is more challenging for the uninitiated, more reliant on at least a passing knowledge of the names and ideas with which he toys. Challenge, however, is undoubtedly what this rich and strange volume intends. Beneath its several authors, its multiple timeframes, its blurring of many genres, is the turbulence of Brazilian Amazonia itself, a place for which the unsettling resilience of the apuizeiro is the perfect metaphor: \u201cEvery part, no matter how small, is alive. It cannot be reduced to an individual. It is the solidarity of the infinitesimal, essential, elemental, inseparable and indivisible.\u201d Amazonia is presented as a world that thwarts any attempt at categorisation, any decision as to what is single and what is multiple; this bamboozling and hearteningly ambitious volume is a parallel challenge to our pre-existing categories, not least the category of the book itself. Verdant Inferno/A Scabby Black Brazilian by Alberto Rangel/Jean-Christophe Goddard (translated by Thomas Murphy and Maya B Kronic) is published by Urbanomic (\u00a316.99).

        "text": "After a \u201crobust and competitive\u201d hunt for a new chief executive, the board of BP has decided that the best appointment is the bloke who has been sitting in the boardroom for three and a half years already and doing the job on a stand-in basis since the defenestration of Bernard Looney last September.No surprise there. BP has never appointed a boss from outside, and Murray Auchincloss, the former chief financial officer, fits the bill as a continuity candidate. He has been in the company for 25 years and is wedded to Looney\u2019s \u2013 and chair Helge Lund\u2019s \u2013 strategy of \u201corderly\u201d transition to net zero by 2050 or sooner. He did the numbers on the approach, after all.Continuity won\u2019t be everybody\u2019s cup of tea, however. Some investors will hate it. They are the ones who don\u2019t sign climate activist resolutions and don\u2019t buy the idea that BP\u2019s \u201ctransition growth engines\u201d \u2013 wind turbines, hydrogen, biofuels and electric vehicle (EV) charging points \u2013 can ever generate the same returns on capital as fossil fuels. They would rather oil companies stick to producing oil and gas (and ramping up the dividends and share buybacks) while leaving the transitioning stuff to specialists.On Looney\u2019s watch, BP\u2019s shares persistently traded at a discount within the Big Oil club. In a post-Covid world of higher oil prices, the very oily and cash-generative Americans, Chevron and Exxon, sit atop the valuation charts. Versus Shell, which last year abandoned plans to cut oil production each year for the rest of the decade, BP also stands at a discount. Looney\u2019s own tweak was to lower BP\u2019s target for a cut in hydrocarbon production from 40% to 25% by 2030, but it didn\u2019t close the valuation gap.What is Auchincloss to do? Well, one hopes he does what he says and sticks to the plan. Somebody within oil\u2019s old guard has to try to demonstrate that it is possible to generate the same returns in energy outside fossil fuels. BP\u2019s pledge is that biofuels (gas and liquid) and EV charging points can produce an oil-like 15% over the cycle. If that was achieved, some of the doubts would fade.Half the problem, though, is long lead times. BP\u2019s transition assets are likely to produce top-line earnings of only $1.5bn this year, which barely moves the dial at a company of its size. It is only by 2030, when the relevant earnings are scheduled to be $10bn, that doubters may have started to rethink. The only sure answer is to hit every target on the way and avoid obvious financial duds, such as wind in the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is also true; fossil fuels are still projected to be 75% of the group\u2019s earnings by 2030. But, within a deeply divided investor base, Auchincloss will primarily feel the heat from those who would be oily for longer. That\u2019s life, unfortunately. But continuity, however dull it sounds, is a reasonable stance for BP\u2019s under-pressure board to take at this point. The current strategy is three years old, which is no time in the energy business. It should be given a chance to succeed or fail.",

So local walkers were horrified when they woke up one morning to an act of \u201cenvironmental vandalism\u201d that left behind the maimed stumps of 100 ancient beech trees.Residents in the east Devon community are grieving the loss of the beloved trees, which were located in a special conservation area and site of special scientific interest, home to lots of local plants and animals, after a government agency issued a licence for the trees to be felled without consulting the community or council.An application was made by a local landowner to the Forestry Commission, a branch of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It would not comment on individual cases, but said all decisions were taken in line with its standards.The trees were located in a special conservation area. Photograph: Fiona CarrollAlan Pearce, a tree warden from the area, said: \u201cIt certainly ought to be a fairly wide consultation because it\u2019s part of our heritage, grown-out hedges that go back hundreds of years. Once they\u2019re gone you\u2019re talking about 200 years to regrow. The stumps look nearly all of them perfectly sound and solid. I can\u2019t see they can say they were diseased or dying. We\u2019re meant to be planting trees, not felling them.\u201dHe said people were \u201cabsolutely horrified\u201d, with one walker in tears over the decision, which he suggested may have been taken in order to improve grazing land in the adjacent field.Fiona Carroll, another resident, said: \u201cMany people walk in this area as it is part of a large expanse of heathland and they are at a loss as to why this has been allowed to happen. These were, in my view, valuable landscape and wildlife trees situated along an extensive ancient Devon bank. The roots had grown into large supporting structures giving many a distinctive look. My current impression is that this destruction is nothing short of an act of environmental vandalism.\u201dEwan Macdonald, who researches how people engage with the environment at the University of Oxford, said he was not surprised the felling had provoked such an emotional reaction because of the way people connected with trees.\u201cIt highlights how intrinsically bound up things like trees, the environment and conservation are with our culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThe value of trees gathers importance with age, so I can see why removing them is upsetting. It\u2019s a natural thing that people form an attachment to things they can personify or build a relationship with.\u201dHe added: \u201cI do think it is always important to engage the local community with any decision that is made about conservation. That\u2019s not to say that the Forestry Commission didn\u2019t have good reasons for removing the trees, but communicating those reasons to people and making sure the community feels engaged and brought into that is an important thing. It shows it\u2019s hard for anyone to own nature wholeheartedly.\u201dThe beech felling is not the first to provoke ire. Most recently, the felling of 40 palm trees in Torquay in Devon that appeared in 1970s sitcom Fawlty Towers prompted accusations the council had wrought \u201ctotal destruction\u201d on the seafront.This followed a similar controversy when 110 trees were removed under cover of darkness in March 2023 in Plymouth as part of the relandscaping of the city\u2019s Armada Way, ultimately leading to the resignation of the council\u2019s Conservative leader.And in 2016, five people were arrested in a bitter dispute with the council over tree felling in an affluent Sheffield suburb. Nick Clegg, then the constituency\u2019s MP, described the incident as \u201csomething you\u2019d expect to see in Putin\u2019s Russia, rather than a Sheffield suburb\u201d. The subheading and main text of this article were amended on 2 January 2024, to clarify that the government agency had issued a licence for the trees to be felled, rather than felling them itself as an earlier version indicated.",

And it failed, 12 October). This announcement was no doubt music to the ears of the construction industry, much as John Prescott\u2019s Pathfinder programme, with its egregious narrative of social cleansing and enforced renewal, was widely perceived as a sop to potential party donors in the building industry.The Labour party would seem to have forgotten that we are living with a climate crisis, and the most sustainable homes are the ones that already exist in our cities. These should be urgently upgraded and fully insulated, without question. Unfortunately, UK governments have collectively subverted this objective by levying VAT on such improvements in existing residential buildings. This is surely one of the great environmental scandals of our time.David J BlackEdinburgh Having sat on local planning committees and seen the damage that badly conceived housing schemes wreak on rural communities, I fear for the future. Such developments damage the environment and are completely at odds with the UK\u2019s net zero commitment. In addition, planning laws that are there for good reason would be torn up, and the views of local people ignored.The vast sums that would have to be spent on these mammoth projects should be used to improve existing housing and crumbling infrastructure \u2013 hospitals, schools, roads \u2013 neglected by politicians for decades. Levelling up should be in the forefront of Labour\u2019s minds. Catherine FrancisHurtmore, Surrey I wonder if Simon Jenkins has ever thought to ask the people who live in new towns whether they consider them to be a success or a failure. My family and I benefited greatly from moving to the new town of East Kilbride. It is unfair to conflate new towns with brutalism. Cumbernauld should not be condemned as a brutalist failure because its town centre building was demolished any more than Portsmouth should be condemned for the demolition of the Tricorn centre. These buildings were the fashion of the time.The UK has a housing crisis that only public bodies with the powers of a development corporation can alleviate. There is no reason why a carefully planned and situated new town \u2013 based on sustainable public transport, digital networking and, most importantly, decent and truly affordable public housing \u2013 would not be a success.Michael KennyGlasgow Keir Starmer recognises that planning is needed beyond council level, and that infrastructure such as schools and medical facilities have to go alongside. Labour needs to go further, and include jobs in this; it\u2019s foolish to build new towns and make everyone commute to work. At present, builders build where the jobs are, however over-built the locality is. We need regional planning to put jobs, housing and infrastructure together \u2013 a job for government, not the market.Michael HurdleSend, Surrey Labour could make a good start by stopping all council house sales when it comes into office.

This contains the active substance cyproconazole, which is banned for use in the EU.They also found the insecticide Regent 800WG, produced by BASF, and Certero, made by Bayer, which include the active ingredients fipronil and triflumuron. Both substances are banned in the EU.The ECHA has classed epoxiconazole as a suspected carcinogen, and similar concerns were highlighted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).Sugar at a Copersucar warehouse in Santos, Brazil.

But with water temperatures unlikely to be much above 10C \u2013 a swimming pool is usually heated to 26-28C \u2013 caution is advised for anyone planning to take part.The Manchester Guardian had a correspondent booted up for the original mass trespass. They reported a \u201cbrief but vigorous hand-to-hand struggle\u201d with a series of gamekeepers employed by the wealthy landowners, who tried and failed to stop the walkers asserting their right to roam.A plaque commemorating a mass trespass of 1932 when group of ramblers defiantly walked across Kinder Scout. Photograph: AA World Travel Library/AlamyOne of the organisers of the Kinder \u201cswimpass\u201d, who asked not to be named, said they were not expecting arrests, nor tussles with anyone employed by United Utilities, which owns the reservoir.Though the firm operates a blanket no-swimming ban, and last year blamed wetsuited wild swimmers for setting a bad example to novices, the laws around reservoir access in England and Wales are disputed and rarely, if ever, get tested in the courts.According to the Outdoor Swimming Society (OSS), \u201cThere is a strong argument based on detailed research by many organisations and campaigns that there is a \u2018public right of navigation\u2019 on all rivers that can be navigated by any sort of boat, and therefore a right to swim.\u201dDespite this, United Utilities and other companies have in recent years employed security guards in hi-vis tabards to order swimmers out of the water and to scare would-be dippers away.The OSS argues that water companies have a statutory duty to provide recreational access to waterways, not just for angling and dog walking but also swimming. In Scotland, swimmers have since 2003 enjoyed a right to swim freely in almost all Scottish reservoirs.UK minister defends shelving of \u2018right to roam\u2019 report ahead of Kinder Scout trespassRead moreSunday\u2019s swimming trespassers will be cheered on from afar by Catherine West MP, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on swimming.\u201cI think as an awareness-raising campaign it sounds like a good way of getting everybody to take more note of how clean or otherwise the waterways are, and also of campaigning for constant improvements to our outdoor swimming opportunities,\u201d said West, who swims regularly at Hampstead ponds near her north London constituency.She wants to see better swimming education for children so that they grow into adults who understand the risks of swimming in open water. People choosing to swim outdoors, who are not under the influence of alcohol and do not jump in, make up a small fraction of UK drownings, the OSS notes.Ramblers resting on Kinder Scout hills in 1932. Photograph: Dave Bagnall Collection/AlamyOne of the organisers of Sunday\u2019s Kinder swim said they were optimistic that the narrative was changing around access to open water after more people discovered the endorphin highs of wild swimming during Covid.\u201cIt\u2019s 90 years since the trespass that triggered a series of events that led to us having the right to roam freely, off the footpath. It opened up the huge landscapes to people from industrial cities, enabling workers from Sheffield and Manchester in particular to come out and get fresh air and all the benefits of getting up high on the hill and enjoying the countryside,\u201d they said. \u201cThe benefits of open water are very similar.\u201dCovid, they added, had \u201copened the floodgates\u201d as more people had discovered \u201cthis untapped resource on the doorstep of millions of people\u201d.A United Utilities spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise the right to protest, but we have to remind anyone thinking of taking a dip that the reason we don\u2019t allow swimming is because it is very dangerous.\u201cKinder reservoir is an operational site with deep, cold water and hidden hazards. The reservoir is constantly supplying water for the Stockport area so there are also strong currents below the surface.\u201d",

        "text": "What is the IPCC AR6 synthesis report?The fourth and final instalment of the sixth assessment report (AR6) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of the world\u2019s leading climate scientists, is the synthesis report, so called because it draws together the key findings of the preceding three main sections. Together, they make a comprehensive review of global knowledge of the climate.The first three sections covered the physical science of the climate crisis, including observations and projections of global heating, the impacts of the climate crisis and how to adapt to them, and ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They were published in August 2021, February and April 2022 respectively.The synthesis report also includes three other shorter IPCC reports published since 2018, on the impacts of global heating of more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, climate change and land, and climate change and the oceans and cryosphere (the ice caps and glaciers).What will the key findings be?There is no new science in the synthesis report, just a recap of the main findings of the previous publications. Those include warnings that the world was approaching \u201cirreversible\u201d levels of global heating, with catastrophic impacts rapidly becoming inevitable; and that it was \u201cnow or never\u201d to take drastic action to avoid disaster.Much of the synthesis report is likely to focus on the future, setting out the possible policies and actions that will stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown and warning of the impacts of further heating.If the main findings have already been published, why is this report needed?Its purpose is to reduce the thousands of pages of science to a shorter format, which is further condensed into a \u201csummary for policymakers\u201d, to provide scientific underpinning for global climate action. It is written by scientists but haggled over by representatives of the UN\u2019s nearly 200 governments, so some argue it is subject to watering down by regimes that do not like its messages.The report is supposed to inform the next UN climate summit, Cop28, which will be hosted by the United Arab Emirates in Dubai from 30 November. There, nations\u2019 progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions since the Paris climate agreement of 2015 will be assessed. It is certain to find that governments are well off track on their emissions-cutting goals.Will this report change anything?This is the sixth IPCC report since the body was set up in 1988, with each comprehensive assessment taking roughly six to eight years to compile. As the reports have grown in size and urgency, so have global greenhouse gas emissions. In 2018, the IPCC warned that emissions must be halved by 2030, compared with 2010 levels, to have a good chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C. Yet emissions continue to climb. Last year, they rose by a little under 1%, according to the International Energy Agency. That leaves a rapidly diminishing \u201ccarbon budget\u201d for the world to stay within the IPCC\u2019s advised limits.What should governments do?Reduce emissions sharply and give up fossil fuels, through investments in renewable energy and other low-carbon technologies, increase energy efficiency, rethink agriculture and restore forests and degraded natural landscapes. It may also be necessary to develop technologies that suck carbon dioxide from the air, called \u201cdirect air capture\u201d, or explore other means of \u201cclimate repair\u201d.When is the next IPCC report?Not until about 2030. That means AR6 is effectively the last IPCC report while it is still feasible \u2013 only just \u2013 to stay within 1.5C.Now that the impacts of the climate crisis are highly visible, and the underlying science well understood, some argue that the reporting cycles should be shortened, so that policymakers can receive clearer scientific advice throughout this crucial decade.The IPCC can also be ordered to compile shorter reports on specific subjects, in between its mammoth comprehensive assessments. The increasingly urgent question of what to do if the world overshoots 1.5C of heating could well be a candidate for such treatment.",

        "text": "Politicians know they can\u2019t win an argument without making it. Yet unfortunately that is what Sir Keir Starmer seems to believe. In 2021, the party earmarked \u00a328bn a year for a green industrial strategy to rid the economy of its carbon addiction and create a wave of \u201cclean jobs\u201d. This summer, however, the spending was postponed to the second half of the next parliament. Then it was reported that it would take a full term to ultimately redeem the pledge. Last week, because of self-imposed fiscal rules, Sir Keir suggested it might not happen. This was unsettling, especially as Labour is miles ahead in the polls. Yet more disappointment is in store. On Tuesday, according to reports, the Labour leader will extol the virtues of small technocratic policies rather than big transformative ones.Sir Keir is mistaken if he thinks he can avoid a fight by not turning up. British governments are unusually free to overhaul the country\u2019s economy, but electoral support is the crucial precondition for such changes. Green policies won\u2019t happen by themselves. This week, Cop28 will reach a climax, spotlighting the climate emergency. Inaction is not an option: relying on volatile gas prices would cost Britain double that of achieving 2050 net zero targets. Sir Keir knows that Labour spending will be caricatured as a \u201ctax bombshell\u201d by the Tories. Ministers hope to overwhelm facts with emotional force. But Labour should take heart that Rishi Sunak\u2019s U-turn on climate targets in September, coupled with a conspiracy-laden assault on the opposition, fell flat with voters.In a cost of living crisis, Sir Keir is right to worry that a majority of Britons think getting to net zero means higher prices. But who pays for green plans can be answered by Labour saying Britain can borrow to invest. Labour has vote-winning policies: strengthening energy security, generating employment and creating new industries. The cost of new technologies, such as heat pumps, will fall as they are more widely adopted. Sir Keir could also sell his green prosperity plan as a way of helping households by promising cheaper energy bills. Properly taxing oil and gas windfall profits would mean less borrowing.The polls show only 9% of people are aware of Labour\u2019s plans. The risk is that if Tory scaremongering is all the public hears, then Sir Keir may lose support. However, if voters heard \u201ca confident, united Labour case first, the opposite is true\u201d, wrote the pollster Steve Akehurst last week. When he ran focus groups that pitted Tory attacks over fiscal profligacy against Labour\u2019s positive messaging, Sir Keir\u2019s party gained support. Labour\u2019s rebuttal, if grounded in economics, defused Conservative attacks. Mr Akehurst is right that public attitudes to the idea of borrowing to invest\u00a0are more permissive \u201cin a country that is falling\u00a0apart at the seams\u201d.Reaching net zero will be costly and disruptive. Long-term targets are needed to drive transitions in energy, transport and homes. But voters want to know that Labour has a well-thought-out plan to share the cost equitably between government and private sectors. In cutting energy-efficiency measures in homes and slowing down the transition from carbon-powered cars and boilers, Mr Sunak left voters more exposed to the high costs of imported fossil fuels. The government\u2019s climate advisers warn that there aren\u2019t the policies in place to meet net zero. By contrast, Labour\u2019s plans are electoral assets, not liabilities. It has popular green arguments. Sir Keir should sell them.",

Owners of the most polluting cars can expect to pay more than twice as much as cleaner cars. There are now 26 different charges to park for an hour in Lambeth, depending on a car\u2019s tax band and whether there is a diesel surcharge. The cost of a parking bay near Waterloo station in south London now ranges between \u00a36.30 and \u00a313.23 an hour, with payment made by an app.The consultation on the charges introduced on 30 May included a new pricing structure for residents\u2019 parking permits, which are already based on CO2 emissions. The annual cost of the highest band has risen from \u00a3340.73 to \u00a3500, with an additional annual surcharge of \u00a3140 for a diesel vehicle that does not comply with Euro 6 emission standards.Of more than 2,900 responses in the consultation, 59% objected to the proposals. Lambeth has implemented the changes despite opposition, stating that air quality is a major public health issue and a wide range of interventions is required.The drive to reduce car journeys and create what are known as 15-minute cities (in which key local facilities are within 15 minutes walk or cycle from someone\u2019s home) has created divisions in many neighbourhoods.A small network of streets in Herne Hill in south London is one of the low-traffic schemes being piloted in Lambeth, which stops residential roads being used as \u201crat runs\u201d, with wooden planters installed as barriers.Luke Cadden, 59, a handyman who pays for a residents\u2019 parking permit for a Nissan Qashqai and opposes the road closures, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t just keep increasing all the charges. Where do they think working people are going to get the money? It\u2019s just a racket.\u201dNorma Gray, 87, a member of the congregation of the Temple of Truth, an international pentecostal church, was tending its plants on Friday. She does not support the low-traffic neighbourhoods. \u201cThey are trying to get less cars on the road, but they are not improving the public transport,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Gill Acham, 59, a secondary school teacher, who owns an electric Nissan Leaf ,is in favour of higher parking charges for cars with greater CO2 emissions. \u201cClimate change is here and it\u2019s going to be painful,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to change our ways.\u201dIndustry experts said that modern parking apps \u2013 such as RingGo and PayByPhone \u2013 offer the technology to levy higher charges for vehicles that pollute more. These apps can identify the tax band of a vehicle using its number plate. There are 13 tax bands, which are based on a vehicle\u2019s CO2 emissions.Peter O\u2019Driscoll, managing director of RingGo, said the emissions-based charges were shown to change motorists\u2019 behaviour. He said: \u201cPeople make fewer journeys or they choose a cleaner vehicle.\u201dAdam Dolphin, managing director of PayByPhone UK, said its emission-based product, Emitless, was now used by eight councils in London, including by Kensington and Chelsea, Lewisham and Lambeth, with varying types of emission charging. He said: \u201cOutside London, many local authorities are looking at this as an option.\u201dBath and North East Somerset council and St Albans are among those considering similar schemes.Jemima Hartshorn, founder of the campaign group Mums for Lungs, welcomed the new measures. \u201cEvery journey that we make by car involves parking so if it becomes more difficult or more expensive people are going to think about it more carefully,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are so many trips that could be walked or cycled instead.\u201dRezina Chowdhury, cabinet member for sustainable Lambeth and clean air, said: \u201cWe were the first London borough to declare a climate emergency, and we have set a target to slash our carbon emissions to make Lambeth a net-zero borough by 2030.\u201cThese changes will make our parking fees structure fairer and more reflective of the different levels of pollution produced by vehicles \u2013 and ensure those who pollute the most are charged the most to park.\u201d",

But new research suggests that by eating some parts of the coral and then pooing in different areas of the reef, they are part of a cycle that redistributes beneficial microbes that can help coral thrive.\u201cCorallivorous fish are generally regarded as harmful because they bite the corals. But it turns out that this doesn\u2019t tell the whole story,\u201d said Dr Carsten Grupstra, of Rice University, the lead author of the study. \u201cThey often get a bad rep, and lots of scientists see them as damaging. But I hope this work shows that they can be a part of a healthy ecosystem.\u201cCorallivore faeces contain many of the bacterial taxa that associate with healthy corals under normal conditions, potentially resulting in the natural dispersal of \u2018coral probiotics\u2019, analogous to faecal microbiota transplantation therapy in humans.\u201dThis means that when some fish faeces interact with coral colonies on the reef, and these microorganisms are transferred from the poo to a new coral colony, they can be beneficial to that new coral colony.The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science this week, looked at the different impacts of grazer fish, which consume algae and detritus. Until now it had been assumed that they contributed to reef health, but the study found faeces from grazers, which contain disease pathogens, can leave dying patches, known as lesions, on corals.00:01:55Why we need to stop killing coral reefs: underwater in Egypt \u2013 videoThe scientists examined the impact of faeces from corallivore and grazer fish and found that the grazers caused lesions or death in all coral pieces, whereas faeces from corallivores caused fewer and smaller lesions and rarely caused death. Moreover, the corallivore faeces helped disperse helpful microbes, keeping the reefs healthy.The research was done to determine what types of bacteria were contributing to the impacts noticed on the coral, whether the excrement included specific coral diseases, and whether the results of the faeces addition experiment could be applied to other fish that ate coral, algae and detritus.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Scientists have discovered a method to give new life to old plastic \u2013 by converting it into soap.Plastics are chemically similar to fatty acids, which are one of the main ingredients in soap. For Guoliang Liu, an associate professor of chemistry at Virginia Tech and author of the paper published in the journal Science, this similarity suggested it should be possible to convert polyethylene into fatty acids, and then into soap. The problem was size: molecularly, plastics are very large, about 3,000 carbon atoms long, whereas fatty acids are much smaller.The solution came to Liu in an unusual way. \u201cIt was Christmas. I was watching the fireplace,\u201d he said.When firewood burns, it gives off smoke, which is made up of smaller particles of the firewood. Liu wondered whether burning plastic would work the same way.\u201cFirewood is mostly made of polymers such as cellulose. The combustion of firewood breaks these polymers into short chains, and then into small gaseous molecules before full oxidation to carbon dioxide,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we similarly break down the synthetic polyethylene molecules but stop the process before they break all the way down to small gaseous molecules, then we should obtain short-chain, polyethylene-like molecules.\u201dLiu and colleagues built an oven-like reactor that could be used to safely burn plastic. The temperature at the bottom was hot enough to break up the polymer chains, while the top was cooled low enough to stop them breaking down too far.The scientists collected the residue and found the product they had created was short-chain polyethylene, a type of wax. They then went on to turn the wax into soap.\u201cIt\u2019s the first soap ever made from plastic in the world,\u201d Liu said. \u201cIt has a bit of a unique colour. But it works.\u201dLiu\u2019s method works on polyethylene and polypropylene, which are the two most common types of plastic. Together, they make up about half of all plastic waste: close to 200m tonnes every year. More than 80% of plastic waste goes to landfill, while less than 10% is recycled. One of the benefits of Liu\u2019s method is that it works on \u201cend-of-life\u201d plastics, which cannot be recycled through normal means. The method was also designed to be able to be scaled for use in an industrial setting.Liu urged caution, though. \u201cPlastic pollution is a global challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the major problems facing our society, and this is one piece of a bigger puzzle. We need a joint effort between the research and industrial communities. And the best way to avoid plastic pollution is to minimise the use of plastics.\u201d",

You can find their data online alongside those from more than 30,000 citizen scientists around the world.Tebbutt\u2019s network often measures particle pollution in the evenings, as people sit around their fires: \u201cI began making measurements out of concern about wood smoke pollution from the proliferation of domestic solid fuel burning in Chorley. I wanted to prove to the council that the area has an air pollution problem. I also use the real-time levels to lobby various people and agencies on social media.\u201dAir pollution concerns are not confined to towns and cities. Jo Clark, who lives in rural north Wales, also has her own monitor: \u201cI have been able to show others, such as my local authority, how the particle pollution goes up and down over the days, months and years \u2013 and how it can vary from the very general ambient levels forecast and reported by Defra or the Welsh government.\u201dThe London mayor and Bloomberg Philanthropies are taking a different approach by distributing 60 free Breathe London sensors to community groups.Andrew Grieve, who works on the project at Imperial College London, says: \u201cIn our experience the groups see collecting local air quality data as an opener to discussing broader visions for their neighbourhood with their community and as a way to get a seat at the table with city authorities.\u201dThat is certainly how some of the groups are seeing it. Rectory Road residents\u2019 association in north London, which has joined the Breathe London project, said: \u201cAs a large BAME community, we feel we have been ignored; our asks haven\u2019t been met and we are struggling to have any serious commitment and action to tackle toxic air pollution.\u201d Others including Victoria Park Harriers and Tower Hamlets athletics club are keen to use the data to help their community at times when air pollution is bad and to help them advocate for change.Governments have struggled to act on the concerns of citizen air-quality scientists and harness the opportunities they present. Citizen science has a long history in observations of the natural world. For example, ornithological research relies heavily on volunteer observers who share their data but air pollution measurements are usually the domain of university or government scientists that use standardised approaches and expensive instruments. Although less accurate, citizen measurements may help to raise awareness of air pollution problems and make the case for more action.",

        "text": "Climate litigation poses a financial risk to fossil fuel companies because it lowers the share price of big polluters, research has found.A study to be published on Tuesday by LSE\u2019s Grantham Research Institute examines how the stock market reacts to news that a fresh climate lawsuit has been filed or a corporation has lost its case.The researchers hope their work will encourage lenders, financial regulators and governments to consider the effect of climate litigation when making investment decisions in a warmer future, and ultimately drive greener corporate behaviour.The study, which is currently being peer reviewed, analysed 108 climate crisis lawsuits around the world between 2005 and 2021 against 98 companies listed in the US and Europe. It found that the filing of a new case or a court decision against a company reduced its expected value by an average of 0.41%.The stock market responded most strongly in the days after cases against carbon majors, which include the world\u2019s largest energy, utility and materials firms, cutting the relative value of those companies by an average of 0.57% after a case was filed and by 1.5% after an unfavourable judgment.Although modest, the researchers conclude that the drop in the value of big polluters is statistically significant and therefore down to the legal challenges.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know before if the markets cared about climate litigation,\u201d said Misato Sato, lead author of the study. \u201cIt\u2019s the first evidence supporting what was suspected before; that polluting firms and especially carbon majors now face litigation risk, in addition to transition and physical risk.\u201dResearchers also found share prices fell more in reaction to novel cases involving a new form of legal argument or filed in a new jurisdiction.For example, when the Peruvian farmer and mountain guide Sa\u00fal Luciano Lliuya filed an unprecedented legal claim against RWE in 2015, seeking compensation for its role in causing historical climate change that threatens his home, the German energy giant\u2019s relative value fell by 6%. It dropped again by 1.3% in 2017, when an appeals court allowed the claim to proceed.Another important case with a more complex picture was brought against Shell by the Dutch NGO Milieudefensie, which argued that the company had an obligation to reduce carbon emissions from its global operations,Shell\u2019s relative value actually rose by 1.9% when the lawsuit was filed in April 2019. But two years later, when a court at The Hague ordered Shell to cut its global carbon emissions by 45% by the end of 2030 compared with 2019 levels, it fell by 3.8%. Shell is appealing against the decision, but is supposed to comply in the meantime.The researchers found consistently larger effects on corporate share prices after the Shell case was launched \u201csuggesting capital markets are increasingly responding to climate litigation\u201d.There has been a surge in climate litigation against fossil fuel firms and other polluting industries in recent years, with many cases challenging corporate inaction on the climate crisis and attempts to spread misinformation, and companies are increasingly recognising it as a risk.BP, for example, has been the subject of numerous climate-related claims, including those brought against the fossil fuel industry by towns, states and municipalities across the US, which are inching towards hearings in state court.According to BP\u2019s climate-related financial disclosures, published alongside its annual report in April, changes in law and regulation, as well as shifting social attitudes, could have \u201cadverse impacts\u201d on its business by making it more likely to lose court cases and exposing it to greater environmental and legal liabilities. Legal proceedings, it warns, \u201ccould reduce our financial liquidity and our credit ratings\u201d.Legal experts told the Guardian they expected climate litigation to be a recurring theme in annual accounts as companies become subject to stricter disclosure rules.Sato said it was too early to say if litigation was driving substantial changes in climate action among big polluters, but evidence that lawsuits affected share price or credit ratings could help influence corporate behaviour.Andrew Coburn, the chief executive of the climate risk company Risilience, noted that defending a major lawsuit was rarely perceived well by the market, with expensive payouts and reputation damage causing short-term valuations to take a significant hit. \u201cRisilience\u2019s analysis suggests that damages could amount to 5% or more of a company\u2019s revenue in the event of climate litigation.\u201dCoburn added that the increasing willingness of regulators across the UK and Europe to clamp down on perceived greenwashing \u201cdemonstrates additional financial risks for firms failing to present credible, ambitious and realistic climate-transition plans underpinned by transparent data\u201d.",

The nooks and crannies of the medieval church are perfect entry points for the winged mammals, whose bodies are about the size of a thumb. In the warmer months, they emerge every evening from the rafters as darkness falls.\u201cThey like our church,\u201d says Janet Needham, the warden, over tea and chocolate digestives in the church library.\u201cThe other day, someone asked me if bats are religious. I always say they are Anglican,\u201d adds Diana Spencer, the Bats in Churches engagement officer for East Anglia. \u201cIt\u2019s safe, it\u2019s dry, there are insects in here, they can feed, there\u2019re no predators, no rain, it\u2019s dark. They just like it.\u201dPews at All Saints Church, Thornham covered in polythene to catch bat droppings. Photograph: Church of EnglandThe feeling has not always been mutual. The mess caused by sharing an old church with a colony of bats \u2013 which have formed nationally significant roosts in the buildings \u2013 has threatened some churches with closure, as droppings and urine built up, damaging artefacts that had survived Henry VIII and the English Reformation.Thornham is one of more than 100 historic churches in England that have received support from the \u00a35m Bats in Churches scheme, which was launched in 2019 to help resolve the growing problem of human-wildlife conflict caused by bat damage.\u201cIf they\u2019re not a happy church, the first thing you\u2019ll hear is: \u2018We don\u2019t like the bats, we want rid of the bats,\u2019\u201d says Spencer. \u201cBut actually, once you start talking to them, it\u2019s not the bats; it\u2019s the mess, it\u2019s the urine, it\u2019s that they\u2019re causing damage to something. When they try and do a tea and coffee morning, as soon as the drinks come out, there is bat mess in them. That\u2019s the bit that winds people up, understandably,\u201d she says.In Thornham, before the project, the front pews were covered with polythene to catch the droppings, which peaked during the bat breeding season in high summer. It made it hard to hold services, weddings and events for the 15-strong congregation. Now, bat boxes and specially heated roosts have been installed to encourage the winged mammals to make their home away from areas that are disruptive in the church.Bat droppings on the floor of St Botolph\u2019s in Banningham, Norfolk. Photograph: Church of EnglandThe Heritage Fund grant has helped pay for cleaning and mitigation work at the most affected churches in a five-way partnership between the Bat Conservation Trust, the Church of England, Natural England, Historic England and the Churches Conservation Trust. At least two church have been saved from closure, and dozens of roosts have been protected. They include the incredibly rare grey long-eared bat whose numbers have dropped to about 1,000, which was recorded at a church in Somerset.Some of the most successful interventions have been low-cost, according to the project, such as using canopies and covers to protect areas from being damaged, and buying vacuum cleaners and brushes.God\u2019s own gardens: why churchyards are some of our wildest nature sitesRead moreAs part of the Bats in Churches project, 753 churches have been surveyed, finding 12 of the country\u2019s 18 species, which are protected by law after historic declines in their populations.Spencer says the churches have also become an important national source of information on bat populations and their habits. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned so much \u2026 over the last five years monitoring bats in these churches. Every time someone does a survey, we learn something new,\u201d she says.In Norfolk, which has a particularly high number of medieval churches that are home to bats, many have been surveyed by the ecologist Phil Parker, a self-confessed bat enthusiast who sometimes sleeps overnight in churches to complete his work. Parker has set up cameras in the bat boxes at Thornham to monitor numbers. Four species have been recorded at the church \u2013 soprano pipistrelles, long-eareds, common pipistrelles and serotines.\u201cSeveral times we\u2019ve been in a church where young bats have been flying. You can always tell the difference: the adults will be up high in the roof flying around purposefully and the youngsters will be really low over the pews,\u201d says Parker, who also monitors church Facebook groups for signs of bat activity. \u201cI have had them land on me.

        "text": "Arsenic particles are being spotted by scientists in London\u2019s air, as concerns grow that people are increasingly burning waste wood from construction sites while being unaware of the serious health risks.Dr Anja Tremper at Imperial College London\u2019s air research station in south London tracked January\u2019s data and found arsenic particles in London\u2019s air, especially around the weekend of 22-23 when air pollution reached the top index value of 10 on the UK government\u2019s scale.Tremper said: \u201cThis is part of a long-term pattern. When I investigated the pollution sources in the 2019 and 2020 dataset, I also found arsenic among the chemicals from wood smoke.\u201dDespite clear messages from government and local councils, a survey for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in 2018-19 revealed that about 9% of people who burned wood at home were burning waste wood.The problem is that construction wood is normally treated with preservatives to protect against insects and fungi. Before 2006 the preservatives used in the UK frequently contained arsenic. This arsenic becomes part of the ash and smoke when the wood is burned.The survey found examples of people burning fence panels, pallets, old furniture, doors, door frames and construction wood salvaged from skips. One woman described how her husband collected waste wood from skips using a wheelbarrow.Many people in the survey did not know what types of wood might be treated and others justified their behaviour as harmless because they only did it occasionally. Another mistakenly thought their Defra-approved stove would remove any toxins.And this problem is not isolated to London. Dr James Allan, who operates Manchester University\u2019s air research site, said: \u201cWe see arsenic in Manchester as well, associated with cold weather and the black carbon that you get from wood-burning.\u201dIn Auckland, New Zealand, scientists have been investigating if people in the city were being exposed to arsenic from wood-heating. Many New Zealanders pride themselves on finding and burning free wood. Despite official warnings, almost 20% of homes routinely burn construction wood. This can lead to airborne arsenic concentrations that are double the UK and EU legal limits.As part of the research, 30 men were asked to grow beards for two weeks, then shave and collect the hair for analysis. Arsenic in their bodies would be incorporated into their growing beard forming a record of their exposure.Aside from cigarette-smoking, the biggest factor that affected arsenic in the men\u2019s beards was the frequency of wood-burning smells in their neighbourhood, suggesting that nearby wood-burning was a main exposure route. More arsenic was also found in the beards of men who burned wood offcuts, so arsenic from their wood burner could be a problem too.The New Zealand study looked at exposure only and not the men\u2019s health. However, the American Medical Association reports an extreme case of arsenic poisoning in family that burned construction wood to heat their home. As well as breathing arsenic-laden smoke, ash and dust from their fire was thought to be a significant exposure route.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Annual average concentrations fell until 2008, as coal-fired power stations closed, but have been relatively flat for more than a decade. Reassuringly, they have been less than 20% of the maximum values set in UK and EU law but the sampling points in this network are not designed to detect neighbourhood-scale impacts from residents who burn waste wood, nor air pollution inside these houses.During the Greek financial crisis, many people turned to burning waste wood and old furniture to heat their homes. This led to increased wood burning pollution along with arsenic and also lead from old paint. We are waiting to see if the current high energy prices and cost of living crisis is leading to more people burning waste wood across the UK and Europe. This article was amended on 13 February 2023. The use of arsenic as a preservative for treating new wood has been banned in the UK since 2006 so this story and image were changed to reflect this.",

There are also concerns that Hinkley\u2019s start date may be delayed from the summer of 2027 to the early 2030s.Sunak said the government\u2019s latest support for the nuclear industry was \u201cthe next step in our commitment to nuclear power, which puts us on course to achieve net zero by 2050 in a measured and sustainable way\u201d.00:06:26Nuclear Narnia: why is Sellafield Europe's most dangerous industrial site?\u201cNuclear is the perfect antidote to the energy challenges facing Britain \u2013 it\u2019s green, cheaper in the long term and will ensure the UK\u2019s energy security for the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will ensure our future energy security and create the jobs and skills we need to level up the country and grow our economy.\u201dEDF said in January it would delay the shutdown of four of its UK nuclear reactors for at least two years to help plug the looming gap in the UK\u2019s nuclear supplies towards the end of the decade.Britain\u2019s nuclear power output fell to its lowest level in more than 40 years in 2023 after three reactors closed in the previous two years and statutory maintenance forced temporary shutdowns at four reactors. EDF said its nuclear output in the UK had fallen from a high point of 65 terawatt hours in 2016, from eight nuclear plants, to less than 40TWh in 2023.The company is pinning its hopes for its future nuclear generation on the delayed Hinkley Point C project and its planned successor project at Sizewell C in Suffolk, which has been planned for the past 12 years but has yet to receive a final investment decision.Jess Ralston, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said the government\u2019s multimillion-pound investment of public money in the nuclear industry should \u201chopefully unleash further private sector investment\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ministers encouraged the public to reduce their energy consumption with an advertising campaign.A relatively mild winter in the UK is also expected to have reduced gas demand.ScottishPower said its retail profits were also hit by the cost of buying energy at higher prices before the government guarantee, which covers the wholesale costs for suppliers, was introduced in October. The company hopes to recover a \u201csignificant proportion of the losses incurred in 2022\u201d during this year.Profits in ScottishPower\u2019s renewables business, which includes Whitelee, the UK\u2019s largest onshore windfarm, near Glasgow, rose 24% to \u00a3730m, helped by windier weather, selloffs of IT and offshore assets, and higher energy prices. Windfarms produced a record amount of Great Britain\u2019s electricity last year.A levy on electricity generators was introduced at the start of the year to capture windfall profits made as wholesale power prices surged. However, ScottishPower said gains made through higher energy prices had been partly offset by charges paid to National Grid to balance supply and demand.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "More than five decades after being captured in the waters off the Pacific north-west, Tokitae the orca has a plan to return home, delivering a victory to animal rights advocates and Indigenous leaders who have long fought for her release.After half a century in captivity, Tokitae the performing orca could finally go homeRead moreOn Thursday, the owners of the Miami Seaquarium where Tokitae lives announced a \u201cformal and binding agreement\u201d with a group called the Friends of Lolita to begin the process of returning Tokitae to Puget Sound. A news release indicates that the joint effort is \u201cworking toward and hope the relocation will be possible in the next 18 to 24 months\u201d.Tokitae is the oldest killer whale in captivity. Now in retirement, she spent decades performing at the Miami Seaquarium, where she went by the name Lolita. She lived in the smallest orca enclosure in North America, in a pool of water that made her skin infected and was fed fish that was occasionally rotten and led to intestinal issues.Over the years multiple groups, including members of the Lummi nation and animal rights organizations, have called for the whale\u2019s release from the Seaquarium, with some staging protests outside the facility.The audience at the Miami Seaquarium watching Lolita at its 40th anniversary performance. Photograph: Jeff Greenberg/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesA \u201cgenerous contribution\u201d from Jim Irsay, owner of the NFL\u2019s Indianapolis Colts, helped alleviate the financial questions around Toki\u2019s future. \u201cI know she wants to get to free waters,\u201d Irsay said at a news conference Thursday in Miami. \u201cI don\u2019t care what anyone says. She\u2019s lived this long to have this opportunity.\u201dTokitae\u2019s ordeal began in the calm waters of Penn Cove, Whidbey Island \u2013 a quiet island off the coast of Washington State \u2013 five decades ago. Men with long sticks and guns corralled a group of resident killer whales, separating mothers from their calves. At least a dozen of those whales died during the capture, and more than 50 were kept for captive display.One of those calves was four-year-old Tokitae. Back home, the native Lummi people call her Sk\u2019aliCh\u2019elh-tenaut \u2013 meaning that she is a member of Sk\u2019aliCh\u2019elh, the resident family of orcas who call the Salish Sea home. The tribe, who views killer whales as part of their extended family, have never stopped fighting for her release.There are still questions about Toki\u2019s health and her ability to travel across the country to a sea pen. The pen would be constructed with the help of the non-profit Whale Sanctuary Project, which is also creating the world\u2019s first whale sanctuary off the coast of Nova Scotia, following the model of areas to house big cats, great apes or elephants after they have been in captivity.Activists from Peta and Animal Hero Kids protest to demand freedom for Lolita. Photograph: Crist\u00f3bal Herrera/EPAToki\u2019s relatives \u2013 members of the resident L-pod in the Salish Sea \u2013 are still alive, including the 90-year-old whale believed to be her mother. Experts worry that if she were to encounter her kin, even through a sea pen, the infections Toki picked up in captivity could be spread to other southern resident killer whales, an already-endangered group that numbers only 74 individuals.Federal agencies will have to sign off on any plans to transport the whale. And of course, the stress of travel and a new, wild environment might be dangerous for an elderly whale.Even so, Thursday\u2019s move is a momentous one. Howard Garrett, founder of the non-profit Orca Network who has been advocating for Toki\u2019s release for decades, says the news was lacking in specifics, but it set the tone for unified intention and action. \u201cThat\u2019s what will make it happen. That will greatly influence the agencies and skeptics and naysayers,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was a momentous historical event.\u201d",

        "text": "Health experts have warned that delays to proposed clean air zones in cities including Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds pose a risk to the nation\u2019s wellbeing.Clean air zones (CAZs) are areas in which drivers of polluting vehicles are charged to enter city centres in an effort to improve air quality. With air pollution at illegal levels in many locations for the past decade, causing thousands of deaths a year, local authorities nationwide had announced plans to introduce the zones.But the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in fewer vehicles on the road during lockdown, has led pollution levels to fall. The funding available to local authorities is designed to bring air pollution below legal limits, so some local authorities have been hesitant to proceed while pollution levels remain relatively low.Birmingham\u2019s CAZ was originally scheduled for 2020, but has been delayed until next year, and the council is expected to announce the exact date later this autumn. A spokesperson said: \u201cBirmingham remains committed to launching its clean air zone in 2021.\u201dSheffield and Bristol have also delayed their CAZs. According to Sheffield city council, the city\u2019s air pollution in January-August this year was 33% lower than the same period in 2019.The government is working with cities on the zones through its Joint Air Quality Unit, managed by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department for Transport.Sheffield council\u2019s cabinet member for transport, Bob Johnson, said: \u201cFollowing on from the lockdown required to control the spread of the virus, there have been a number of changes to travel behaviour which has led to improvements in air quality. The current situation is dramatically different to the one in which our proposals were originally developed.\u201dHe said the economic uncertainty arising from the pandemic meant the proposed CAZ needed to be reviewed. \u201cIf we can hold on to clean air by introducing other measures without resorting to charging people, we believe this is the best way forward,\u201d said Johnson.James Lewis, deputy leader of Leeds city council, said: \u201cIf the city\u2019s air pollution is expected to stay below legal limits then we will no longer have the support of the government to introduce a charging clean air zone. Given this uncertainty, our financial support will continue to be paused until the review is complete and we have received further direction.\u201d The city\u2019s plans remain suspended indefinitely.Greater Manchester was expected to conduct a public consultation into its own CAZ this summer but it will instead take place next month. Andrew Western, the councillor leading the city\u2019s plans to improve air quality, said: \u201cWe will use the feedback from the consultation process to inform our final plans and understand how best to ensure our residents are not exposed to illegal levels of air pollution.\u201d\u201cLockdown led to a huge improvement in air quality across our city-region,\u201d he added. \u201cIt also showed that better air quality is achievable, and that vehicle emissions are the key to reducing NO2 exposure.\u201dAbout 800,000 people a year across Europe are estimated to die prematurely because of air pollution.The latest round of delays has led some environmental campaigners to question the government\u2019s commitment to reducing air pollution.Katie Nield, a lawyer at the environmental charity ClientEarth, said: \u201cClean air zones are the key to reducing illegal and harmful levels of pollution in our towns and cities. Resisting and delaying these much-needed measures is shortsighted and adds an unnecessary risk to respiratory health as we grapple with Covid-19.\u201cIt\u2019s not really clear where these U-turns originate. In some cases councils are suggesting central government is behind these delays, while ministers are remaining tight-lipped. The public deserve better. Ultimately it is the UK government\u2019s responsibility to make sure that the necessary work is done to tackle this public health crisis. They are already a decade behind \u2013 people\u2019s health should not have to wait any longer.\u201dA Defra spokesperson said: \u201cWe remain committed to cleaning up our air and are providing \u00a3880m in funding and expert support to local authorities so they can develop innovative plans that work best for their areas.\u201d",

        "text": "For a writer who inspires such devotion, Roger Deakin\u2019s bibliography is short. He only published one book before he died in 2006, the celebrated Waterlog: A Swimmer\u2019s Journey Through Britain. Later came Wildwood, the epic arboreal treatise that was topped, tailed and published after his death, and then Notes from Walnut Tree Farm, gleaned from his copious jottings about life in the Suffolk ruin he restored and continued to share with wildlife that had moved in during the years of dilapidation.Waterlog is often credited with launching the modern outdoor swimming movement, and like many others, I have travelled in Deakin\u2019s damp footprints. I\u2019ve visited Walnut Tree Farm, kept much as it was by the new owners, swum in the moat Deakin reinstated and walked the ancient green lane saved by his campaigning energy.The Swimmer is an unconventional biography of an unconventional person. In his introduction, the Guardian journalist Patrick Barkham explains that he effectively ripped up a 90,000-word draft he\u2019d laboured on for two years, abandoning an attempt at definitiveness that he felt was contrary to the spirit of the man. What he delivers instead is a kind of tapestry fashioned from notes, letters and published works, with Deakin himself as principal narrator and some creative infill by Barkham writing in Deakin\u2019s voice. Given the previous mining of his notes and recordings, much of The Swimmer will feel familiar to fans. But the first-person narration is liberally interspersed with the impressions, memories and perspectives of dozens of interviewees \u2013 friends, relatives, colleagues and associates, pupils from a short but memorable stint as a teacher of English, and lovers, of whom there were many. These perspectives stir sediment into the clear waters of Deakin\u2019s narrative.This is not unwelcome \u2013 in any love there is that moment when the object of our admiration is revealed to be not wholly who we thought. Not more, or less necessarily, but different, muddier. Here perhaps is that moment for Deakinites. Undoubtedly we\u2019re seeing the man more completely than before, perhaps more clearly than he saw himself. The schoolboy, the student, the ad man with a life split between London and Suffolk. The sociable outsider with a hectic, corvid intelligence; a compulsive, impulsive collector of objects, phrases and loves; someone who leaned hard into late-blooming celebrity but who was only really at ease in the water or at home. We pace the brick floor of the Walnut Tree Farm kitchen, eavesdrop on its indoor and outdoor bedrooms. We flinch when he lashes out at those closest to him.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to BookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s.

His long-term partner, Serena Inskip, said of Waterlog: \u201cWe all read it and said \u2018Where\u2019s Roger?\u2019 \u2026 There was a lot more in him than that but he couldn\u2019t get it out, it was too frightening.\u201d The person who perhaps knew him longest, Margot Waddell, mused that \u201che never swims below the surface \u2026 I don\u2019t think he quite realised there was a choice.\u201d Her memorial address added that on the night he died Roger spoke of being able \u201cto see a very deep hole\u201d. Perhaps if he finally looked into those deeps, he\u2019d have seen something like this remarkable book.Deakin likened the tendrils of the tumour that killed him to tree roots penetrating his brain and lived just long enough to be delighted by the concept of the wood wide web, a fitting mycelial metaphor for his relentless urge to make connections of his own. That mission has outlasted him, and this extraordinary insight into his life will lend new complexity and reach to the network.

They were cleared of the charge by a jury on Thursday after a three-week trial.The fashion designer Stella McCartney had lent the women shirts, blazers and suits to wear during their trial at Southwark crown court.After the verdict, Farrell, an associate lecturer in sustainable fashion at Central Saint Martins, said: \u201cThis was a trial of unusual agreement; the facts of the day were not in any dispute, and the fact that we\u2019re on course for civilisational breakdown and climate collapse seemed strangely not to be in dispute either.\u201cIt\u2019s tragically surreal to live in times when the justice system agrees we\u2019re totally fucked but has nothing to say about the cause, the remedy, the victims or the perpetrators. We must continue, we will.\u201dOpening the case, Sally Hobson, prosecuting, said: \u201cThey accept that on 22 April 2021, they went to the HSBC building armed with hammers and chisels and they also accept that they used those tools to break the windows \u2013 they were responsible for the damage.\u201cThe value of the damage caused is in the region of \u00a3500,000 and additional security measures caused further expenditure so as to ensure damage was not caused again.\u201cAlthough the defendants accept they caused the damage, they deny that their actions amount to criminal conduct. Simply put, the damage was caused during a protest and the defendants say that they were lawfully justified in doing what they did.\u201cWe say that whatever the purpose behind them causing the damage there was no lawful excuse for doing so. It was, we say, unlawful conduct outside of a lawful protest.\u201dReid, a retired community worker from Preston, said after the acquittal: \u201cUnicef estimated that over 20,000 children are displaced each day, and that climate change is the key driver. That means that every day of our three-week trial over 20,000 children have had to pick up the things around them and leave, none of those children will be able to go home at the end of the day.\u201cI have spent my life caring for the people around me and I refused to stand by while HSBC poured money into the very thing we know is causing unimaginable harm. The jury\u2019s verdict today shows that ordinary people will not give their consent to the destructive violence of investing in fossil fuels in 2023.\u201d",

        "text": "Dwindling fish stocks caused by the climate crisis are leading to an increase in pirate attacks, according to a new study looking at two piracy hotspots over the past two decades.Warmer seas have negatively affected fisheries in east Africa, one of the world\u2019s worst areas for piracy; while in the South China Sea, another hotspot for attacks, it has had the opposite effect: fish populations have risen.This phenomenon created a \u201crare natural experiment\u201d in which to test the links between climate breakdown and piracy risk, according to Gary LaFree, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Maryland, and one of the co-authors of the paper, published in the American Meteorological Society journal, Weather, Climate, and Society (WCAS).\u201cWe wanted to test the hypothesis: does piracy increase when fish production declines and decrease when fish production increases?\u201d said LaFree. The answer, they found, was yes. \u201cWe did a multi-varied analysis to see whether the underlying theory was statistically significant and it is.\u201dThe study, which looked at more than 2,000 attacks in east Africa and the South China Sea over the past 20 years, found the trends in piracy were linked to the impact of warmer seas on fish stocks.In east Africa, where fish populations are declining due to warmer seas, piracy rates have increased. But rising sea temperature had the opposite effect in the South China Sea. There, fish populations have increased and piracy rates have declined.\u201cIn a timeline of roughly 20 years, we\u2019re picking up statistically significant, measurable differences,\u201d LaFree said. \u201cI was surprised by how rapidly those changes are occurring, especially when you think of climate change most likely accelerating in the future.\u201dPrevious studies quoted in the paper show that fishers, who already have seafaring skills and are some of the poorest communities in the world, are targeted by criminal syndicates engaged in piracy.\u201cYou tend to think either you are a criminal or a non-criminal,\u201d said LaFree. \u201cBut there is evidence from other researchers that some fishermen drift into it, depending on how fishing is going.\u201dIn the ocean\u2019s twilight zone, a fish that could feed the world \u2013 or destroy itRead moreBo Jiang, an assistant professor in the faculty of social sciences at the University of Macau and the lead author of the study, said: \u201cI grew up in Singapore.

It also raised questions over how to help fishers.\u201cFor the governments of Somalia and Kenya and coastal states in east Africa, this is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed,\u201d Jiang said.\u201cIf our arguments are correct, and sea temperatures continue to rise into the foreseeable future, the struggle against piracy in east Africa will become increasingly difficult,\u201d the paper said.Piracy cost the shipping industry $9bn a year and poses a major security threat.

Every angle is covered, from traditional Spanish salmorejo sauce to quirky flummadiddle, a type of savoury bread pudding made with pork, warm spices, molasses and stale bread.Ramsden\u2019s flummadiddle features a whole piece of roast pork belly, but I\u2019ve adapted it to make a lighter breakfast version using bacon and sausages, though if you do happen to have some cooked pork belly to hand, by all means shred it and add to the mix instead of the bacon and sausages.A flummadiddle fry-upTo my mind, a slice of bread and butter is the pinnacle of culinary perfection, but, with a pinch of imagination, a chunk of tradition and a handful of confidence, there are so many other dishes bread (and even stale bread) can be turned into. Flummadiddle is a creative dish both by name and by nature, and I\u2019ve read precious little about it other than a couple of creative interpretations of its description on Wikipedia. It\u2019s a type of bread pudding made with pork fat instead of butter, and Ramsden\u2019s version involves roasting pork belly on top, so the fat renders and soaks into the bread,so basting everything while it cooks.I\u2019ve taken his dish and turned it into a speedy breakfast take on the original, a one-pot fry-up that\u2019s a lovely way to feed a crowd with little fuss. And if you have a houseful eating breakfast as and when, it keeps well in a warm oven, too. It\u2019s easily adaptable for vegetarians or vegans as well, by using butter or olive oil instead of the pork fat and mushrooms and tempeh instead of the meat.Serves 260g bacon lardons or streaky bacon, cut into strips2 sausages, or 100g sliced black pudding20g butter 4 slices stale bread (I used wholemeal spelt), cut into triangles1 egg 180ml whole milk A pinch of ground cinnamon A pinch of ground allspice A pinch of ground cloves Salt and black pepper1 tbsp black strap molasses or treacle (optional) 6 cherry tomatoes, halvedIn a medium-hot frying pan, fry the bacon and sausages in the butter until caramelised and cooked through. Remove the meat from the pan and cut the sausages into pieces. Use the bread to mop up all the rendered pork fat left in the pan.In a jug or bowl, lightly beat the egg, milk and ground spices until well combined, then season generously.Lay half the bread in the bottom of a small, ovenproof dish, scatter over half the meat, and top first with the remaining bread and then the remaining meat. Pour over the custard mix, drizzle over the molasses, if using, and arrange the cherry tomatoes halves on top. Bake in a 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7 oven for 15 minutes, and serve hot with mushroom or tomato ketchup.",

This adjustment raises baseline emissions. Post-Covid car demand has been lowered by 5% to reflect lower levels of commuting. However, the Department for Transport forecasts that HGV and van miles will be higher than that forecast \u2026 due to outturn data showing higher van and HGV traffic than previously assumed.\u201dCampaigners also criticised a new policy by the DfT which requires decision-makers to ignore the negative climate impact of road-building and traffic but to give weight to tree planting around schemes as a nature-based solution to climate change. It says an increase in emissions from road schemes is \u201cnot a reason to prohibit\u201d their approval.There are 32m cars on the UK\u2019s roads, and they are growing in number and size. Transport is the country\u2019s largest emitting sector and produced 24% of the UK\u2019s total emissions in 2020.Chris Todd, the director of campaign group Transport Action Network, said: \u201cThe DfT claims this new policy will ensure transport projects \u2018meet environmental targets\u2019. Yet it states that an increase in emissions from road schemes is not \u2018reason to prohibit\u2019 or restrict their approval.\u201cWith the revised net zero strategy admitting we are off track to meet 2030 targets, ministers are deliberately accelerating us towards runaway climate change. We need the public to tell them to slam the brakes on this road-building spree. Instead, we urgently need world-class public transport and active travel, not world-destroying temperature rises.\u201dFriends of the Earth\u2019s head of policy, Mike Childs, said: \u201cFor far too long transport policy has been dominated by motoring and road building, with its consequential and largely ignored impact on climate change and air pollution.\u201cBritain\u2019s transport system needs a change of direction with priority given to better public transport and cycling infrastructure instead of more motoring. Billions of pounds are being squandered on more road-building when more pressing needs are vastly underfunded \u2013 from rural buses to home insulation.\u201dDr Doug Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, added: \u201cAny government which, in the middle of a climate emergency, finds itself planning for a major programme of new roads can count itself as a failure.\u201dThe government recently blocked the release of the carbon emission figures behind its transport decarbonisation plan. It blocked academics from seeing the figures, which include data on how much car use would have to be reduced in order to reach net zero commitments.Campaigners say meeting these legally binding targets will be possible only with a drastic reduction in motor traffic, which could make many new road projects financially unviable.A DfT spokesperson said: \u201cThis is incorrect. We are committed to delivering our net zero ambition and this hasn\u2019t changed since we published our world-leading transport decarbonisation plan. In line with best analytical practice, the department continually reviews its projections and makes changes when appropriate to ensure plans are based on the latest scientific data.\u201d",

        "text": "What is deep-sea mining?Mining the deep sea involves the extraction of solid mineral resources from the seabed, at depths greater than 200 metres. Vast areas of this unexplored abyss, particularly in the Pacific Ocean, are littered with polymetallic nodules, rich in manganese, nickel, copper, cobalt and other trace minerals. Minerals are also found near hydrothermal vents and within seamounts (underwater mountains).Why is there a growing interest in deep-sea mining?The race to cut carbon emissions to combat global heating has led to a soaring demand for copper, cobalt, nickel and other ingredients needed for the energy transition. In 2040, the world\u2019s need for many of these metals, used for electric vehicle batteries, solar panels and wind turbines, will be twice what it is today, according to the International Energy Agency.Demand for copper, for instance, is expected to double, from 25m tonnes in 2020, to 50m by 2050. Supporters of deep sea mining argue that a huge expansion of mining on land would cause further environmental havoc: mining the sea floor is less destructive, they say. Critics say land mining will carry on and that deep sea mining will cause \u201cirreversible harm\u201d to marine life and systems.What are the potential environmental impacts?Scientists have warned of large-scale, severe and irreversible harm to global ocean ecosystems, already threatened by the climate and biodiversity crises, if deep-sea mining goes ahead. In July, a team of scientists found 5,000 new species in the deep-sea bed, most unknown to science, living in a mineral-rich area of the Pacific Ocean, known as the Clarion-Clipperton zone, targeted by deep-sea mining firms.Studies have shown that mining below 200 metres can cause harmful noise, vibration, sediment plumes and light pollution. A recent study looking at drilling tests in Japan, showed animal populations decrease where mining occurs and it leaves a wider footprint than previously thought. There is also the risk of leaks and spills of fuel and other chemicals used.Which countries oppose or support deep-sea mining?Last year, the UK, Sweden and Ireland joined countries calling for a moratorium, pause or ban on commercial deep-sea mining. The 24 states involved include Germany, France, Spain, Brazil, New Zealand, Canada Costa Rica, Chile, Panama, Palau, Fiji and the Federated States of Micronesia. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has backed a complete ban.Car manufacturers such as BMW and Volvo, and the car battery maker Samsung, have pledged not to use deep-sea minerals in vehicles.Norway\u2019s approval of deep-sea mining in its national waters puts it at odds with the UK and the European Commission, which has pushed for a pause on environmental grounds.Who controls the deep sea?The International Seabed Authority (ISA), a quasi-UN body made up of member states, regulates activities in the seabed in areas beyond national jurisdictions. In June 2021, the small island state of Nauru notified the ISA of its intention to start deep-sea mining, which triggered a rush to complete the ISA regulations. After failing to reach agreement in 2023, the ISA now has until 2025 to finalise regulations that could decide whether and how countries can mine the deep sea in international waters.",

Colombia was the most deadly country, recording 60 murders.Indigenous communities were disproportionately represented in the figures, making up 34% of all murders, despite representing about 5% of the world\u2019s population. The new figures mean that at least 1,910 environmental defenders have been killed between 2012 and 2022, according to Global Witness, with most of the murders going unpunished.Brazil, Mexico, Honduras and the Philippines were the most deadly countries in 2022 after Colombia. Nearly 88% of all lethal attacks were recorded in Latin America, including the killings of the Brazilian activist Bruno Pereira and the journalist Dom Phillips in July.The figures are a drop from the 200 killings recorded in 2021 but remain high, prompting Global Witness to call for special protections for environmental defenders of climate-critical ecosystems.The report highlights the scramble for resources in Latin America, Asia and Africa as a driver of the violence, including the extraction of rare earth minerals used in the production of electric cars and wind turbines.\u201cFor too long, those responsible for lethal attacks against defenders have been getting away with murder,\u201d said Shruti Suresh, the co-director of campaigns at Global Witness.\u201cDespite being threatened by irresponsible corporate and government actions, this global movement of people, united by determination and a commitment to defending their homes and communities, are standing firm \u2013 and they cannot and will not be silenced.\u201dThe report has been produced annually for the past 11 years by Global Witness, which is urging governments to enforce existing laws to create a safe environment for people trying to protect their lands and ecosystems.

        "text": "My Uber driver is weaving around north London looking for a charging point for his electric car. We pass a lamp-post charger, which he dismisses as \u201ca smart solution but slow\u201d, and a dedicated but occupied bay for electric vehicle (EV) charging.Here, like much of inner London, there are few homes with driveways for overnight charging, leaving drivers at the mercy of limited public points. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to hope no one\u2019s there when you need it,\u201d he says.This Uber driver can do more than most to tackle the issue: the Guardian is being driven by the firm\u2019s UK general manager, Andrew Brem, licensed to carry passengers since Christmas. Brem is overseeing the installation in east London of the first of 700 Uber-funded public chargers.In terms of converting its fleet to electric vehicles, London is as good as it gets for Uber. The global bosses of the ridesharing firm will host a \u201csustainability\u201d event in the UK capital on Thursday to announce measures to push greener trips for users and drivers. The chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will take to the Bafta stage to unveil features in the app \u2013 with actor Edward Norton, a longtime Uber backer and climate campaigner, flying in to add a little Hollywood fizz.The choice of London is not accidental: a city that leads the way for Uber in electric vehicle uptake, doubling EV numbers since early 2022 to host 10,000 of the 60,000 registered on the app worldwide. Uber has targeted a fully electric fleet in London by the end of 2025 \u2013 an ambition that looks a tall order if it hopes to keep the current number of 45,000 registered vehicles in action.The transition is partly facilitated by a \u00a3145m clean air fund Uber banked from levies on trips between 2019 and 2022 into individual pots for drivers to buy or subsidise renting an EV, shepherded in by Brem\u2019s predecessor, Jamie Heywood (who now runs a solar power firm in Germany).Brem, meanwhile, isn\u2019t just topping up his salary by driving to get the view from the shop floor; he wanted to go through the process last year when Uber was struggling for drivers as labour shortages bit. Even for a \u201cvanilla\u201d type, as he puts it, with a fixed address and being adept with the admin, the Transport for London licensing process took him eight months.Uber has had an uneasy past with TfL but Brem acknowledges the wider context of city policies as being the major factor in EV growth. The congestion charge and the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) have been significant incentives to electrify \u2013 and since the start of 2023, Transport for London has only licensed private hire vehicles that are zero-emissions capable.London has more of the UK\u2019s 43,000 chargers than other regions, and TfL and the mayor, Sadiq Khan, are to unveil more, but the capital\u2019s relative success masks inequalities. Much is in the hands of boroughs \u2013 and wealthier boroughs have more public chargers. \u201cNot where I\u2019d argue they are most needed,\u201d Brem says, \u201cin Redbridge, Brent or Newham, where people drive most and where most of our drivers are.\u201dOne Uber driver he met has taken to throwing a cable out of the window of his second-floor flat, for convenience and cost-saving: \u201cThe difference between charging overnight at home or rocking up to a Tesla supercharger is absolutely enormous.\u201dAndrew Brem, general manager of Uber UK, has obtained his own licence to drive passengers in London. Photograph: UberReturning to the Guardian offices, Brem, the former chief commercial officer of British Airways, forgets to officially end the booked ride as our interview continues. A warning message pops up on his phone, with an invitation to watch an instructional video on sexual harassment policies \u2013 a reminder of Uber\u2019s efforts to clean up in other ways after concerns over safety and checks on drivers that saw its London licence imperilled for a second time in 2019.As the Guardian\u2019s collaborative investigation into the company, the Uber files, underlined, the firm has had an unsavoury history of attempting to circumvent rules around the globe.Brem says Uber is a very different place now: \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the movie and read the files. That was the past.\u201dNow, he says, they \u201cinfluence with integrity\u201d. He is still not happy about court rulings in Britain that demanded Uber treats drivers as workers. Brem claims those regulations \u201chave not caught up with the gig economy \u2026 or are ridiculously bureaucratic or unfair, where competitors are not complying\u201d.But he says Uber follows the rules, whether it likes them or not: \u201cThe culture is not conservative or staid but it is nonetheless one that takes obligations very seriously. We just try and change them.\u201d",

        "text": "MEPs have been accused of whipping up \u201ca culture war against nature\u201d after the fisheries and agriculture committees voted against the EU\u2019s biodiversity restoration law.Last June, the European Commission revealed proposals for legally binding targets for member states to restore wildlife on land, in rivers and the sea. The nature restoration law was announced alongside separate legislation proposing a crackdown on chemical pesticides with the aim of reversing the catastrophic loss of wildlife on the continent.But there is growing concern that the laws could be abandoned entirely amid opposition from agricultural, fishing and forestry lobbying groups, and some member states. On Tuesday, the European parliament\u2019s agriculture committee voted to reject the nature restoration legislation, and the fisheries committee followed suit on Wednesday.The nature restoration law is a key part of the European green deal that is crucial to meeting international climate and biodiversity commitments. On Monday , the commission vice-president Frans Timmermans said there would not be another proposal.The law aims to reverse the decline of pollinating insects while restoring forests, marine areas and other ecosystems key to food production to improve Europe\u2019s resilience to climatic shocks as the planet warms. It was a key part of the EU\u2019s negotiating position at Cop15 in Montreal last year, where the world agreed to protect 30% of the planet for nature.The centre-right European People\u2019s party (EPP) has called for the nature restoration and pesticide proposals to be scrapped entirely, with liberal MEPs also divided on the issue. MEPs from both groups voted against the nature proposals this week, provoking anger from NGOs.Sabien Leemans, a senior biodiversity policy officer at WWF Europe, said: \u201cWith this rejection, the majority of MEPs in the agri committee are failing all citizens, including farmers. At times when Italy is devastated by flooding and Spain is experiencing severe droughts, this denial of what is happening in Europe is unacceptable.\u201cThe science is clear that nature restoration will increase our resilience to such extreme weather events and support long-term food security. Meanwhile, the agri committee is rejecting the legal proposal to restore nature. It is a totally irresponsible attitude that puts everyone\u2019s livelihoods at risk, first and foremost the ones of farmers.\u201dIn an interview with the Guardian last week, the EU\u2019s environment commissioner said rejecting the law would send a dangerous signal to the world and undermine climate and biodiversity targets.Ariel Brunner, a regional director at BirdLife Europe, said: \u201cPoliticians are whipping up a culture war against nature, instead of facing up to reality.

Noaa data from the 50 most populous cities in the US shows the heatwave season is 49 days longer now compared with the 1960s.The effects of heat on health are cumulative, and the body only starts to recover when the temperature drops below 27C (80F). Even small temperature rises can result in increased deaths and illness.\u201cExtreme heat is killer heat, and multiple-day heatwaves \u2013 and early-season ones \u2013 are the biggest threat, because people can\u2019t get a break and the body can only sustain it for so long,\u201d said Brenda Ekwurzel, the director of climate science for the climate and energy programme at the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US. \u201cThese are not isolated heat events; this is what the turbo-charged climate change world looks like.\u201dIn Phoenix, Arizona, the National Weather Service has issued a \u201cvery dangerous long-duration heat\u201d alert for the second consecutive week, with daily temperatures expected to fluctuate between 29C (85F) and 47C (118F).Temperatures in Europe are about 10-15C hotter than usual, and the heatwave is lasting a long time, as an established high-pressure system across the region is causing temperatures to climb every day. Clouds of Saharan dust are also making conditions worse.The sun has heated the sea, too, which is causing a feedback loop, prolonging the heatwave on land. Usually cool air blowing off the Mediterranean brings some relief.\u201cUnusually high sea surface temperatures are also occurring across the region, with many parts of the Mediterranean seeing surface temperatures as high as 25-28C,\u201d said Rebekah Sherwin, a meteorologist from the Met Office\u2019s global forecasting team. \u201cThis will exacerbate the effects of the heat over surrounding land areas, as even in coastal regions overnight temperatures are unlikely to drop much below the mid-20s celsius.\u201dEven though in the UK we may feel relief that we have escaped the deadly temperatures of mainland Europe, the effects can still be expected to reach us.Gareth Redmond-King, the head of the international programme at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: \u201cEven as Britain experiences a gloomy and relatively cool July, the extreme heat and droughts, torrential rains and flooding around the world have a direct hit for us too. We import half our food \u2013 half of that comes from climate-vulnerable countries. As harvests are hit by climate disasters, supplies are constrained and prices rise.\u201dWhile the current heatwaves are not solely caused by global heating \u2013 El Ni\u00f1o has a part to play \u2013 scientists say they have certainly been made worse, and more likely, by climate breakdown and fossil fuel emissions.\u201cWe can be in absolutely no doubt that a critical driver behind this warming trend is carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels,\u201d said Dr Leslie Mabon, a lecturer in environmental systems at the Open University. \u201cUntil we rapidly reduce emissions from fossil fuels, extremes like the heatwave we are seeing in Europe at the moment are going to become more and more likely.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It doesn\u2019t harm a plant; it simply accelerates what happens naturally. A patch of meadow this size \u2013 50 hectares or so \u2013 will produce many millions of seeds each year so it can spare a few for a poor relative down south.Despite my suit, I\u2019m soon shivering.

And because one of the large players, the Metals Company, is registered here, even though it doesn\u2019t have an office in Canada, it feels important to see Canada\u2019s opposition; they are genuinely seen as a middle ground,\u201d said Susanna Fuller, vice-president of conservation and projects at environmental nonprofit Oceans North.\u201cThe fact that Canada has now joined calls for a moratorium is quite important.\u201dThe International Seabed Authority, the quasi-UN body in charge of possible regulations, is meeting this week in Kingston, Jamaica, after a 9 July deadline to develop rules and regulations governing mining in international waters passed without a clear framework.Companies can now apply for provisional mining licences, and while the ISA has already issued 30 licences for exploration only, no provisional commercial licences have been approved. The 36-member council will debate the issue on Friday.In June, the European Academies Science Advisory Council warned of the \u201cdire consequences\u201d for marine ecosystems if plans for deep-sea mining went ahead. Experts have concerns about sediment plumes, noise, vibration and light pollution as well as possible spills of fuels and other chemicals used in the mining process.In February, video footage from a deep-sea mining test showed sediment discharging into the ocean and raised questions over the safeguards within the industry and the effects mining could have on ecosystems that scientists are still trying to better understand. In recent months, 5,000 new species were discovered in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, the very space targeted by deep-sea mining companies.Future of deep-sea mining hangs in balance as opposition growsRead more\u201cWith the success of recent international agreements, we\u2019re also seeing we can\u2019t continue to exploit new environments and meet our obligations around biodiversity protection,\u201d said Fuller.While companies have framed the drive for mining the ocean floor as a way of easing demands on the metals needed to transition away from fossil fuels, Fuller says more can be done on land before pushing into a new frontier.\u201cThere\u2019s so much stuff to do on decarbonisation before we ever need to mine the deep sea. We aren\u2019t even recycling so much of the existing rare earth metal,\u201d she said.\u201cThe deep sea has always been a place of wonder and now there\u2019s the possibility it will be a place of massive exploitation. And I think people and nations are finally seeing that we can\u2019t just continue to new environments just because a couple of companies say it\u2019s a great idea.\u201d",

But about half of Democrats said the same, despite more than 90% of them saying oil and gas companies were at least somewhat responsible for climate change.Notably more Americans had negative opinions about BP, possibly linked to the negative publicity the company received after the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig accident in the Gulf of Mexico, which is still the biggest oil spill in American history.Opinions on top oil and gas companies are split down party linesFor decades oil and gas companies ignored their own scientists who told them their products were harmful to people and the environment as early as the 1970s.In fact, they bankrolled multimillion-dollar campaigns to downplay the climate crisis and misled the public by saying global heating was a theory not based in scientific fact.This poll shows these efforts have been largely successful, especially among Republicans who have been heavily influenced by misleading stories in conservative media like Fox News.Majority of Americans don\u2019t think oil and gas companies participated in climate change disinformationOil and gas companies have also pushed advertising that insinuates that individuals should be responsible for climate change, not corporations like themselves.According to this poll, their efforts have worked \u2013 even on Democrats. The idea of a \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d was introduced by fossil fuel companies to encourage individuals to reduce their emissions, and framed Earth\u2019s runaway emissions as a problem to be changed by habit.Meanwhile, researchers have found that just 20 oil and gas companies are responsible for more than one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide since 1965.What Americans say they\u2019re willing to do or already do to mitigate the climate crisisIn a covert recording released by Greenpeace earlier this year, the Exxon lobbyist Keith McCoy is heard on camera saying the company is actively fighting the Biden administration\u2019s efforts on climate change, and admits that Exxon pushed back against climate science \u2013 something most Americans don\u2019t know yet.\u201cDid we aggressively fight against some of the science? Yes. Did we hide our science? Absolutely not. Did we join some of these shadow groups to work against some of the early efforts? Yes, that\u2019s true. But there\u2019s nothing, there\u2019s nothing illegal about that,\u201d he says in the recording. \u201cWe were looking out for our investments.

        "text": "Just 2% of rainforest tree species account for 50% of the trees found in tropical forests across Africa, the Amazon and south-east Asia, a new study has found.Mirroring patterns found elsewhere in the natural world, researchers have discovered that a few tree species dominate the world\u2019s major rainforests, with thousands of rare species making up the rest.Led by University College London researchers and published in the Nature journal, the international collaboration of 356 scientists uncovered almost identical patterns of tree diversity across the world\u2019s rainforests, which are the most biodiverse places on the planet. The researchers estimate that just 1,000 species account for half of Earth\u2019s 800 billion trees in tropical rainforests, with 46,000 species making up the remainder.\u201cOur findings have profound implications for understanding tropical forests. If we focus on understanding the commonest tree species, we can probably predict how the whole forest will respond to today\u2019s rapid environmental changes,\u201d said the lead author, Declan Cooper, from the UCL centre for biodiversity and environment research. \u201cThis is especially important because tropical forests contain a tremendous amount of stored carbon, and are a globally important carbon sink.\u201dThe team of scientists demonstrated that while African tropical forests have fewer total species compared with the Amazon and south-east Asia, their diversity follows the same pattern. The analysis is based on more than 1m tree samples across 2,048 hectares (5,050 acres) of rainforest at 1,568 locations. They found that about 2.2% species made up 50% of the trees across the biome.\u2018Don\u2019t fool yourself\u2019: billions more needed to protect tropical forests, warns new reportRead moreProf Bonaventure Sonk\u00e9 of the University of Yaound\u00e9 I in Cameroon, said: \u201cThe fact that African forests do not have so many species compared with Amazonian and south-east Asia forests is well known, but we also find that they have the same proportion of species that are common, which points to the existence of fundamental rules that all the world\u2019s tropical forests comply with.\u201dResearchers said the findings indicate that a mechanism may govern the assembly of all the world\u2019s tropical forests. They plan to focus future work on identifying the potential rule, given the geographic differences of the forests they studied. African tropical forests experience a drier, cooler climate than the two other regions, while those in south-east Asia are spread across disconnected islands. The Amazon is a large region of connected forests in which humans have been living for a shorter time than the other regions.The senior author, Prof Simon Lewis of UCL\u2019s geography school and the University of Leeds, said: \u201cWe wanted to look at tropical forests in a new way. Focusing on a few hundred common tree species on each continent, rather than the many thousands of species that we know almost nothing about, can open new ways to understand these precious forests.\u201cThis focus on the commonest species should not take away from the importance of rare species. Rare species need special attention to protect them, but quick and important gains in knowledge will come from a scientific focus on the commonest tree species.\u201d\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features\n",

Also known as the plum pudding pig, it has distinctive spots and is often illustrated in children\u2019s books. The list shows that the number of dams producing pedigree progeny has fallen 32% since 2020.The number of British Landrace dams producing pedigree piglets has plummeted by more than 95% since 2006. Photograph: Andia/UIG/Getty ImagesThe pink British Landrace pig breed was already in the RBST watchlist\u2019s most urgent priority category, and has seen a dramatic decline with just 23 dams producing pedigree progeny in 2022, down from 43 in 2021. This compares with 495 dams registered in 2006.The RBST chief executive, Christopher Price, said: \u201cThe British Landrace is in a particularly worrying situation. It is a fantastic breed for really high quality bacon and pork production, very easy to manage and excellent for improving other breeds of pig. But it is not as well known as some of our other native pig breeds. We are working with the British Pig Association and the small but dedicated community of British Landrace keepers to make sure the breed\u2019s excellent attributes aren\u2019t overlooked, as well as ramping up support for conservation and breeding programmes.\u201dThe list shows that other native pig breeds, including the British Saddleback, Gloucestershire Old Spot and Middle White, are breeding less.Price added: \u201cThe crisis in the pig industry over the past two years is driving a very worrying and worsening situation for several of our rare native breeds. Fewer people are keeping these breeds now, and the number of new piglet births is falling too. Each of these breeds has unique characteristics. They are part of the UK\u2019s heritage but they also have an important role in food production today and the resilience of our pig industry into the future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Much of your reporting of the Derna flood disaster (Libyans call for inquiry as fury grows over death toll from catastrophic floods, 14 September) has focused on the state of the dams and the political situation, together with the extreme weather event, but there is another factor that makes the town highly vulnerable. It appears to be built on an alluvial fan \u2013 a cone-shaped feature of the landscape, formed over millennia by sediment deposition from the river. These features form where steep rivers exit mountain upland, spread out and split into a series of distributary channels down the fan (like a delta).In many cases around the world, as in Derna, the water flow has been engineered into a single, embanked channel on one flank of the fan and building allowed right up to its margins. In an extreme event, as has happened here, the enormous water flow has reverted to its natural pathways, overflowing the constrained channel and flowing in multiple pathways down the fan feature on which most of the town is built.Such locations are particularly vulnerable to the effects of extreme flows, and demonstrate the dangers of trying to control nature by large-scale channel diversion and embanking. It is essential, especially with climate change, that natural settings and situations are recognised and that we work with nature much more to manage floods and rivers sustainably.Prof Janet HookeUniversity of Liverpool On 2 November 1925, the Eigiau dam in north Wales broke, releasing 70m tons of water down the valley. Ten adults and six children were killed. Since then, no deaths have resulted from UK dam breaks. There are more than 2,000 reservoirs in the UK that contain over 25,000 cubic metres of water. It is shocking to see how many buildings today are at risk from dam breach inundation on the flood-risk maps on the government\u2019s website.Planning permissions are still routinely given for new developments on floodplains and in dam breach shadow zones. This should surely be illegal because of the growing number of lives destroyed for those living in flooding homes. The Libyan dam break demonstrated how catastrophic the effects of a major dam break can be. It may be only a matter of time before UK dams are similarly challenged by the increasingly extreme weather events we are experiencing here.Susan RoafOxford The flooding in Derna is no doubt the result of the climate crisis and may well have been prevented by competent governance (The Guardian view on Libya\u2019s floods: humans, not just nature, caused this disaster, 13 September). But few people know that during Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s tenure there was a strategic plan to develop all of Libya\u2019s vast coastline from Tripoli to the Egyptian border for tourism, creating new towns, improving conservation and modernising a thousand miles of infrastructure.A coastal pipeline was being built prior to the war to bring Saharan fossil water to irrigate what once was the Roman empire\u2019s breadbasket. In my job as a landscape architect I designed four national parks, including Al Guarsha in Benghazi.Numerous new hospitals and universities were under construction, all of which came to a crashing halt at the onset of the \u201cgreen revolution\u201d that was crushed by the regime, before Gaddafi in turn was justly defeated in the ensuing conflict.

        "text": "Plant-based pork ribs with a twist \u2013 edible vegan bones \u2013 will soon make their debut on diners\u2019 plates, a vegan food company has announced.The idea of the edible bones, produced by Juicy Marbles, began with the manufacturer wanting the bones to be compostable, but then realising they could also be eaten. The first products will be available from the end of August in the UK, EU and US.The price has yet to be set and the company will gather customer feedback from the first batches to tweak the product\u2019s recipe, name and packaging before the full launch. The cost will be higher than regular ribs, which are generally a cheap meat product.Makers of plant-based meat are continuing to innovate, but some big companies in the sector have had a slump in sales as the cost of living crisis pushes shoppers towards cheaper regular meat.Cutting traditional meat consumption in rich nations, where people already eat more red meat than is healthy, is vital to tackling the climate crisis. Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture are dominated by those from livestock, particularly cattle, which make up 15% of all global emissions.Plants cause far lower emissions. Cutting meat and dairy consumption also slashes pollution, and land and water use, with scientists saying it is the single biggest way for people to reduce their impact on the planet.\u201cTo some, bones from plants may be an ideological provocation, but we shouldn\u2019t take these things too seriously,\u201d said Vladimir Mi\u0107kovi\u0107, co-founder of Juicy Marbles, which is based in Slovenia. \u201cIt\u2019s just fun. Bones invite you to eat with your hands and share [food] with the whole table.\u201dThe first batch of the soya-based ribs will go on sale in late August. Photograph: Juicy Marbles\u201cThere is a culture of celebration, sharing, and belonging around meat [and] anyone cutting down on meat can feel excluded from cultural traditions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we chose ribs as our next product.\u201d The company started selling a marbled plant-based steak and a tenderloin in 2022.The bones, which have the same amount of protein as beef jerky, need to be baked or fried to produce a crispy snack, after the plant-based meat has been eaten. \u201cWe started off just by not wanting the bones to be garbage,\u201d Mi\u0107kovi\u0107 said. \u201cMy hope is that we can also infuse the bones with flavour, so you could also cook them in a broth. The most important thing is that we see how people react.\u201dThe first batch of the soya-based ribs will go on sale in late August. \u201cWe want to gather as much feedback as possible because friends and family can only take you so far with honest criticism.\u201d The ribs would be on general sale in early 2024, he said.Earlier in August, the vegan burger pioneers Beyond Meat reported sales had fallen by almost a third, with its stock market 90% down on its 2019 peak. Vegan specialists such as Meatless Farm and Plant & Bean in the UK went bust earlier this year.The cost of regular meat does not reflect its environmental impact and many plant-based meat companies are still scaling up production and reducing their costs. But as well as the price factor, Mi\u0107kovi\u0107 said the sector had had lots of \u201ccopycat brands\u201d trying to take market share without a focus on quality.\u201cThe stock market performance of one company does not make the category viable or not, and nor does a couple of plant-based companies dying,\u201d said Mi\u0107kovi\u0107. \u201cBusiness is hard and companies, including meat and dairy, die. Our sales are only going up, although we are a new company.\u201dOther meat alternatives are continuing to expand. The Israeli company Aleph Farms recently submitted an application for sales approval to the UK\u2019s food regulator for its steak, cultivated by growing real meat cells in vats. It was the first such application in Europe and followed approval of two cultivated chicken products in the US in June. The Czech company Mewery unveiled a burger made from cultivated pork in June.Meat and dairy production uses 83% of farmland around the world and causes 60% of agriculture\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, but provides only 18% of calories and 37% of protein. A 2022 report from the Boston Consulting Group said plant-based meat was by far the most effective climate investment.",

        "text": "The bumper revenues of oil-producing states should be subject to a $25bn levy to help pay for the impact of climate disasters on the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people, a group of former world leaders and leading economists has said.Seventy international figures led by the former UK prime minister Gordon Brown signed a letter calling for the measure before a crucial UN climate summit, Cop28, that begins in Dubai on Thursday. The signatories include 25 former prime ministers or presidents.Such a levy would shave off only a small fraction of the bonanza that oil-producing countries have made in recent years, and would help to fill a fund for the \u201closs and damage\u201d to poor countries afflicted by the impacts of the climate crisis.Brown told the Guardian: \u201cThe deadlock on climate finance has to be broken if Cop28 is to succeed. After more than a decade of broken promises, a $25bn oil and gas levy paid by the petrol states and proposed by the UAE as chair of Cop would kickstart finance for mitigation [reduction of greenhouse gas emissions] and adaptation in the global south.\u201cBut all the main historic and current emitters must come to the table with guarantees and grants if the $1tn a year needed for development and climate funding in the global south is to be raised.\u201dThe letter is being sent to the Cop28 president-designate, Sultan Al Jaber, who is also chief executive of Adnoc, the national oil company of the United Arab Emirates, and to the current G20 president, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva of Brazil.Signatories include the former UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon; the former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark; the former president of Malawi Joyce Banda, and the former president of Chile Michelle Bachelet, as well as scores of leading economists.The letter points out that, according to the International Energy Agency, petroleum revenues were $1.5tn a year pre-Covid but soared to a record $4tn in 2022. This is 20 times the entire global aid budget, more than 30 times the budgets of all multilateral development banks combined, and 40 times the $100bn a year promised in 2009 for poor countries to help cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis.The authors write: \u201cIn the space of just a year, $2.5tn of windfall profits were gained by the oil producer states and their national and other private companies that they have done nothing to earn.\u201dFilling the loss and damage fund is one of the key tasks at Cop28, as few countries have yet stepped up. Hundreds of billions will be needed, which most developing countries acknowledge is likely to be beyond the reach of governments alone, so sources of revenue being explored include potential levies on frequent flyers and on international shipping.The Guardian understands that the UAE is considering a contribution to the loss and damage fund but this is not in response to calls for a levy.The levy on fossil fuel-producing countries proposed in Brown\u2019s letter would represent about 3% of the oil and gas revenues of the world\u2019s biggest petrostates, and the signatories wrote that the loss and damage fund should not be the only beneficiary, as other programmes could also be targeted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Photograph: 5th Element ExpeditionsStarting with a treacherous seven-week crossing of the Southern Ocean on Nanook X, a specially adapted steel-hulled, carbon-neutral boat, Wilson and three crewmates, including his 22-year-old son Kitale, will explore the world\u2019s most isolated and vulnerable environments.Alongside Kitale, he will attempt a crossing of the Patagonian ice cap, the world\u2019s largest and fastest-receding contiguous extrapolar ice field, sled more than 1,000km on a return trip to Antarctica\u2019s Ronne ice shelf and use kite power to shoot for the fastest crossing from the south pole to the edge of the continent.\u2018No one wants to be right about this\u2019: climate scientists\u2019 horror and exasperation as global predictions play outRead moreNanook X will then set sail for the northern hemisphere, where father and son will aim to complete a crossing of Iceland, traverse the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard \u2013 home to the highest density of polar bears on Earth \u2013 and attempt to become the first unsupported team to reach the northern pole of inaccessibility.The boat is kitted out with solar and hydro power options to feed its computers and navigation systems, with the team recycling chemicals and waste, and working with a carbon auditor to offset any emissions produced when using an engine or air travel.And what of critics who would suggest the Project Zero team would do more for the environment by staying at home?\u201cIt\u2019s a very fair comment but it\u2019s not genuine,\u201d says Wilson, whose previous Antarctic missions raised almost $400,000 for the McGrath Foundation.\u201cThe simplest way to reduce human effect is to get rid of humans but we need to be practical. It\u2019s natural for humans to want to explore and adventure. It\u2019s actually essential for our mental health to have dreams and visions.View image in fullscreen\u2018We must at least explore carbon neutral.\u2019 The green-powered Nanook X. Photograph: 5th Element Expeditions\u201cIf I look back at previous adventures, I was very green once I got to the ice. It was all manpower and I had very little carbon production other than a bit of a stove in the evening, but if I\u2019m honest with myself, the getting in and out [of the destination] was super carbon producing.\u201cI\u2019d love to go back \u2013 with more understanding of climate change \u2013 but you only know what you know at the time.\u201cAs outdoors people, we can no longer impact the very environment we seek to protect by our ins and outs. We must at least explore carbon neutral.\u201dWilson\u2019s previous adventures have given him visceral insights into the impacts of a warming planet.In 2020 he was stuck for 10 days waiting to get off Antarctica, while the runway melted down to sea level.\u201cTalking to Antarctic hands who had done 20 summers there, they had never seen anything like it so it was my realisation that we can\u2019t bury our heads any more,\u201d he recalls.\u201cIt was the same in 2017 flying to the start of my crossing of Greenland. The start point was 14km inland from where we had seen the glacier on a map in 1952. You\u2019re sitting in a chopper looking at this rock that should have kilometre-deep ice over the top of it and thinking, \u2018Holy crap, that change has happened in my lifetime.\u2019\u201cOperating in the delicate parts of the planet is almost like being in the womb of the Earth and you\u2019re seeing the pain that is coming ahead of time. For me, it\u2019s a real awakening. You can\u2019t pretend this isn\u2019t happening any more.\u201d",

The Maasai regard this land as their home.The leaders arrested last week have not been seen since they were detained. The NGO Pan-African Living Cultures Alliance said it plans to stage a mass protest on Wednesday unless they are released.One member of the Maasai community, who declined to be named, said at 6am on Friday police fired \u201cmany bullets\u201d at protesters. \u201cThey destroyed our boda-bodas [motorcycles], took our cattle and properties had been destroyed.Protestors injured in the clashes have reportedly had to cross into Kenya for medical treatment in order to avoid arrest.

Eight young men were taken away for putting photos on social media. We are under a lot of pressure.\u201dThose wounded in the clashes have reportedly had to cross over to Kenya to receive hospital treatment, since state medical care is being refused to land defenders in Tanzania. Three people reportedly remain in a serious condition.A rights activist working with the Maasai, who wished to remain anonymous, said: \u201cThousands of Maasai from Loliondo are crossing the border, seeking refuge, especially women and kids. They\u2019ve been sleeping in the forest.\u201cThe victims can\u2019t go to hospital in Tanzania \u2013 they\u2019ll be arrested. Kenyan doctors, paramedics and nurses are taking care of those who crossed safely.\u201dPrevious attempts to evict Maasai from the region have been thwarted after local and international pressure. But fears of a renewed attempt were raised in February when Tanzania\u2019s tourism minister, Damas Ndumbaro, said the Maasai did not have a claim to their homeland. In April, community leaders sent letters to the UK and US governments and the EU, appealing for help.Tanzania\u2019s Maasai appeal to west to stop eviction for conservation plansRead moreEarlier this month, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism announced that it wanted to classify more areas as game reserves.The Tanzanian government has denied it is trying to evict anyone and said it was trying to conserve the area. It maintains Maasai will still have access to 2,500 sq km of land.But Denis Moses Oleshangai, a Tanzanian human rights lawyer, said the government\u2019s actions were \u201ca crime against humanity\u201d and called on the international community to intervene. \u201cThe government of Tanzania depends on aid from the west. I am asking countries not to fund Tanzania because it is using this money to terrorise people.\u201dSamwel Nangiria, a local Maasai community leader and the director of the Ngorongoro NGO Network, agreed. \u201cThe international community must hold our government to account,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is brutal, they have used excessive force against Maasai who have lived alongside wildlife for a very long time. If this is not addressed, it will set a precedent and Maasai will be pushed off their land elsewhere.\u201dActivists gathered outside the Tanzania high commission in London in February to protest against the planned eviction.

First, the islands have a low elevation. Mount Alvernia is the highest point in the islands, at just 64 metres (210ft) elevation. Most of the islands rest just a few feet above sea level.Second, they consist of limestone, the Swiss cheese of geology, which is extremely permeable and porous. It allows saltwater to intrude, and can even soak it up like a sponge.A map showing the potential coastline of the Bahamas in the future as a result of global heating. Calculations use IPCC data to predict 0.3 metre rise by 2050 and 0.91 metre rise by 2100. Photograph: Christina Gerhardt text/Molly Roy maps/UC pressAs a result, when sea levels rise, the islands will be inundated not only at the shoreline from sea level rise but also from underground as water can percolate up through the porous material. The southern tip of neighbouring Florida in the US, just 50\u201360 miles (80\u2013100 km) away, is also largely limestone, which has led to inundation in the Everglades and Miami.And third, the Bahamas have a high population density along the coastline. The majority (83%) of the population lives in urban environments; 75% lives on New Providence Island, the main island and home to the capital, Nassau.According to a report on the threat of sea level rise in the Caribbean by Climate Central, \u201cThe Bahamas confront by far the greatest proportional threat: 32% of land [and] 25% of population \u2026 are below 0.5 metres [1.64 ft]\u201d. For the Bahamas, 32cm (1.04ft) of sea level rise is predicted by 2050, and 82cm (2.68ft) by 2100.The Bahamas are also at a high risk of hurricanes and tropical storms because the archipelago sits at the northern end of the Atlantic \u201churricane alley\u201d.\u2018It\u2019s happening now\u2019: how rising sea levels are causing a US migration crisisRead moreAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u2019s fifth assessment report, the impacts of sea level rise measured in national GDP found that alongside islands in the Pacific \u2013 specifically Palau, Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Nauru \u2013 the island group that would be most affected is the Bahamas. In 2020, Moody\u2019s rating agency said the Bahamas was among the four nations forecast to be hit hardest financially by sea level rise, with an estimated 11% of its residents and 15% of its GDP at risk.It also found 12% of its total land mass would be at risk of submersion with 1 metre (3ft) of sea-level rise.If global temperatures increase by 3C, Moody\u2019s predicted 67% of the Bahamas\u2019 population would be affected.In September 2019, category 5 Hurricane Dorian struck Abaco and devastated it and other islands. It caused $3.4bn in damage.Speaking after the storms, the Bahamas\u2019 then prime minister, Hubert Minnis, said: \u201cWe are in the midst of one of the greatest national crises in our country\u2019s history.\u201d This article was amended on 25 May 2023 to correctly name the island of New Providence.\nChristina Gerhardt is an academic, author and environmental journalist: she is associate professor at the University of Hawaii, permanent senior fellow at the University of California at Berkeley and former Barron professor at Princeton University.

The company was fined $353,750, plus costs of $2,374.Flood-damaged NSW roads leave families with 20km drive to school bus stopsRead moreBut the Environmental Defenders Office (EDO) said the Moree floodplain water-theft ruling highlighted the urgent need to review penalties for unlawfully extracting water.\u201cWhile the successful prosecution of these instances of water theft are welcome, the inadequacy of penalties for these offences needs prompt review,\u201d EDO lawyer Andrew Kwan said.\u201cOn its face, $353,000 sounds like a decent fine but it is just 5% of the maximum penalty that was available,\u201d he said.The company committed the offences at a property called Binneguy Station, 38km east of Moree in northern NSW. Of the 1,500 hectares (3,706 acres), 152 are used to grow crops irrigated from the Gwydir River, which include cotton.The NRAR director of investigations and enforcement, Lisa Stockley, said the case is significant because it\u2019s the largest combined fine handed down in a land and environment court prosecution since NRAR started in 2018.\u201cBut also it\u2019s the first tier one offence that we\u2019ve successfully prosecuted,\u201d she said.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nUnder the NSW Water Management Act, Stockley said a tier one offence relates to \u201cintentional, negligent or reckless conduct\u201d and has \u201cmore serious penalties\u201d.The four water offences carried a potential maximum penalty of more than $6m.NRAR said expert evidence found approximately 1,418ML of water was taken above what was recorded by the meter during the offending period.That is equivalent to more than 560 olympic-sized swimming pools.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Rural NetworkFree newsletterSubscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Henry Payson Pty Ltd will pay NRAR\u2019s legal costs, which have yet to be determined, and a further $2,374 to cover the cost of NRAR\u2019s investigation.Stockley said their investigation focused on the offence of knowingly taking water while metre equipment wasn\u2019t working between June 2016-17 and June 2017-18.In her judgment handed down this week, Justice Rachel Pepper said she was \u201csatisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Payson knowingly took water while the meter was under-recording\u201d, and the company\u2019s actions \u201cdeliberately deceived the regulator\u201d about the amount of water pumped from the Gwydir River.Stockley said NRAR has only been in existence for five years, during which they have brought in 36 prosecutions to the state\u2019s environment or local court in relation to water law offences, compared with 23 in the 18 years prior.\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community\n",

        "text": "Rishi Sunak has been accused of breaking his word after dropping the government\u2019s animal welfare legislation.The prime minister promised Conservative colleagues during the leadership election that he would bring the kept animals bill, a key plank of the 2019 manifesto, into law. The legislation was to ban live exports of farm animals as well as clamping down on puppy smuggling and dog theft.However, in parliament on Thursday environment minister Mark Spencer confirmed the legislation would be scrapped.\u201cUnfortunately this multi-issue nature means \u2026 the bill risks being extended far beyond the original commitments in the manifesto and the action plan,\u201d he said. \u201cIn particular Labour is determined to play political games by widening the scope of this bill.\u201d This hints at fears among some Conservatives that the bill could have been used to argue for curbs on hunting and farming.Spencer also announced a new animal sentience committee, which will begin its work next month, and a consultation on higher fines for animal abuse and neglect.The Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation (Cawf) made up of influential Tory patrons including Carrie Johnson, Michael Gove and Zac Goldsmith, has criticised the decision.Animal welfare groups lose court challenge over \u2018Frankenchickens\u2019Read moreLorraine Platt, co-founder of the group, said: \u201cCawf is disappointed by the statement delivered today. We believe this represents a missed opportunity to further enhance the welfare and protection of animals across the United Kingdom. The kept animals bill is strongly supported by MPs, NGOs, charities, and the public alike. Its provisions, which include ending live animal exports for fattening and slaughter, and tackling puppy smuggling, resonate with the public\u2019s priorities and deliver critical Conservative manifesto commitments.\u201cAlmost 14 million people elected this government on a platform which promised to deliver for animals. More recently, the continuation of this bill was promised by prime minister, Rishi Sunak, in 2022 during his leadership campaign. It is these promises we call on the government to honour today, and ensure that the provisions to improve the lives of huge numbers of animals set out in the kept animals bill are carried out in legislation.\u201dThe Boris Johnson government had promised a revamp of animal welfare laws in the UK, using so-called \u201cBrexit freedoms\u201d to ban foie gras and fur imports, as well as passing the kept animals bill.However, successive governments have been less keen on these measures, with environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, having claimed there is not parliamentary time to ban fur and foie gras imports, and there has been a long delay in passing the kept animals bill, which was introduced into the Commons more than a year ago.

        "text": "The Biden administration weakened regulations protecting millions of acres of wetlands on Tuesday, saying it had no choice after the supreme court sharply limited the federal government\u2019s jurisdiction over them.The rule would require that wetlands be more clearly connected to other waters like oceans and rivers, a policy shift that departs from a half-century of federal rules governing the nation\u2019s waterways.US supreme court shrinks clean water protections in ruling siding with Idaho coupleRead moreThe Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Michael Regan, said the agency had no alternative after the supreme court sharply limited the federal government\u2019s power to regulate wetlands that do not have a \u201ccontinuous surface connection\u201d to larger, regulated bodies of water.Justices boosted property rights over concerns about clean water in a May ruling in favor of an Idaho couple who sought to build a house near a lake. Chantell and Michael Sackett had objected when federal officials required them to get a permit before filling part of the property with rocks and soil.The ruling was the second decision in as many years in which a conservative majority on the high court narrowed the reach of environmental regulations.\u201cWhile I am disappointed by the supreme court\u2019s decision in the Sackett case, EPA and army [corps of engineers] have an obligation to apply this decision alongside our state co-regulators,\u201d Regan said in a statement on Tuesday.The rule announced on Tuesday revises a rule finalized earlier this year regulating \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d. Developers and agriculture groups have long sought to limit the federal government\u2019s power to use the Clean Water Act to regulate waterways, arguing the law should cover fewer types of rivers, streams and wetlands. Environmental groups have long pushed for a broader definition that would protect more waters.The new rule is highly unusual and responds specifically to the supreme court ruling in the Sackett case. Typically, a rule is proposed, the public weighs in and then the federal government releases a final version. This rule changes existing policy to align with the recent supreme court decision and is final.Damien Schiff, a senior attorney with the Pacific Legal Foundation who represented the Sacketts, said the Biden administration properly changed rules to eliminate unlawful criteria to protect wetlands. But he added that the rule ignored other ways that the court limited the reach of the Clean Water Act to protect certain streams and ditches.The supreme court ruling was a win for developer and agriculture groups. It said federally protected wetlands must be directly adjacent to a \u201crelatively permanent\u201d waterway \u201cconnected to traditional interstate navigable waters\u201d, such as a river or ocean.They also must have a \u201ccontinuous surface connection with that water\u201d, Justice Samuel Alito wrote.The court\u2019s decision broke with a 2006 opinion by the former justice Anthony Kennedy that said wetlands were regulated if they had a \u201csignificant nexus\u201d to larger bodies of water. That had been the standard for evaluating whether developers needed a permit before they could discharge into wetlands. Opponents had long said the standard was vague, hard to interpret and generally unworkable.Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a separate opinion that the majority\u2019s decision was political, improperly weakening regulatory powers Congress gave the federal government.Because the sole purpose of the new rule is to amend specific provisions of the previous rule that were rendered invalid by the high court, the new rule will take effect immediately, the EPA said.Julian Gonzalez, a senior legislative counsel with Earthjustice, said the change was likely to weaken protections for ephemeral streams, which only flow after rainstorms and are especially common in the arid south-west.Kelly Moser, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the new rule overturns decades of federal law and practice. \u201cThe rule, like the Sackett decision itself, severely restricts the federal government\u2019s ability to protect critical waters including wetlands that shield communities from damaging floods and pollution.\u201dReducing wetland protections \u201cwhile two hurricanes are barreling off our coasts is nothing to celebrate\u201d, she added.In recent years, depending on the political party in the White House, the power of the Clean Water Act has varied sharply. The Obama administration sought to enlarge federal power to protect waterways. The Trump administration rolled them back as part of a broader curtailment of environmental regulations.",

        "text": "Campaigners are to make a high court challenge to the government\u2019s plan to reduce raw sewage discharges into rivers and seas in England, arguing it does not go far enough.Cases to be taken to court by the Good Law Project and the charity Wild Fish, will put the storm overflow scheme under detailed scrutiny. They will argue that the plan will lead to raw sewage being discharged into waterways for decades to come and does not protect the majority of coastal areas designated as ecologically sensitive.After growing pressure from the Guardian and other media, campaigners and some politicians, the government produced the storm overflow plan to force water companies to invest in stopping raw sewage discharges.The scheme gives water companies a deadline of 2035 to reduce the amount of sewage flowing into bathing water and areas of ecological importance, and until 2050 to stop dumping sewage elsewhere. After it was heavily criticised as too weak, the scheme will be challenged in court after the campaigners were granted permission to seek a judicial review.Exclusive: water firms discharged raw sewage into England\u2019s rivers 200,000 times in 2019Read moreEngland has about 14,500 storm overflows, which are supposed to be used in exceptionally heavy rain to stop the sewage system backing up into people\u2019s homes. But evidence found by the Guardian, and evidence to MPs, has shown water companies are routinely dumping raw sewage into rivers and seas even in periods of dry weather.Environment Agency data shows in 2021 storm overflows discharged untreated sewage 372,533 times over a period of 2.7m hours.One legal case is being taken by Good Law Project on behalf of the Marine Conservation Society, an oyster farmer, Tom Haward, and a surfer and ocean activist, Hugo Tagholm.In another case to run alongside, Wild Fish is also challenging the storm overflow plan.Jo Maugham, director of Good Law Project, said: \u201cThis could be the most consequential environmental law case in recent history. We contend \u2013 and the high court now agrees the point is arguable \u2013 that the English common law contains a principle that the natural environment must be protected, must be held in trust, for future generations.\u201dTagholm said the blue spaces so important for wildlife, people and communities should not be treated as dumping grounds. \u201cWe should be free to swim, surf and enjoy our rivers and coastline without fear of sewage pollution,\u201d he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "The number of properties that will be better protected from flooding by 2027 has been cut by 40%, and 500 of 2,000 new flood defence projects have been abandoned, according to the National Audit Office (NAO).The number of homes forecast to be under enhanced flood protection by 2027 has been slashed from 336,000 to 200,000. This means 136,000 more homes will be at risk of flooding since plans were drawn up in 2020, figures from an NAO report show.Despite the government doubling its capital funding in England to \u00a35.2bn to combat the danger of flooding, a quarter of new flood defence projects will now not go ahead. The Environment Agency (EA) has blamed inflation for the cuts in protection.Thousands of homes have been flooded during storms this autumn. Storm Babet was confirmed to have caused more than 2,000 homes to flood, while Storm Ciar\u00e1n flooded more than 1,000. Storm Debi, which is causing havoc in Ireland, is expected to hit the west of England this week. Climate experts say storms are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate breakdown.The EA has added protection from floods to 59,000 properties in England since 2020. It had a target of protecting 336,000 homes by 2027.A shortfall in the agency\u2019s finances means it cannot keep enough flood protections in the required condition to prevent destruction to homes. Due to inflation, the EA is \u00a334m short of its expected budget, which means it will be be able to maintain only 94% to 95% of its assets at the required condition, resulting in 203,000 properties at increased risk of flooding. It had aimed to maintain 98% of its high-consequence assets at their required condition.The flood protection programme got off to a slow start. There was an underspend of \u00a3310m in its first two years, which has been deferred by the Treasury to make sure the government meets its target of spending \u00a35.2bn on flood defences by 2027. Because of this underspend the EA will have to spend an average of almost \u00a31bn each year over the remaining four years of the programme. There are fears from the NAO that these pressures will further erode value for money if hasty decisions are made to spend the funds.The NAO has also warned that the government has not set a long-term target for the level of flood resilience it expects to achieve and that there are no concrete plans beyond 2026 to meet long-term goals, meaning that long-term investment could be inefficient and not sufficiently protect enough homes from flooding.Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: \u201cGovernment recognises the growing dangers from flooding and has committed to doubling its capital funding in England in the six years to 2027, as well as doing more to understand flood risk.\u201cHowever, the capital funding is forecast to better protect only 60% of the properties that were promised when the programme was launched in 2020, while inflation and other programme risks mean the Environment Agency could deliver even fewer than that. If there are further delays to the capital programme, Defra must work with HM Treasury to make sure it is in a position to switch money quickly into maintenance, where this would provide value for money.\u201cEA will have to manage a record level of capital investment in flood defences for the remaining four years of the programme. In doing so, it must resist pressure to accelerate projects or initiate new ones too quickly, if this is likely to lead to cost overruns and delays and put value for money at risk.\u201dCaroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said: \u201cThis report should be right at the top of new environment secretary Steve Barclay\u2019s red box, laying bare the scale of ministers\u2019 unforgivable neglect of this flooding crisis. Just weeks after huge numbers of homes were hit by devastating flooding, people are crying out for support and protection \u2013 yet this government has utterly failed to provide it. To add insult to injury, thousands more are expected to be unprotected from flooding risk in the years ahead.\u201dA Defra spokesperson said: \u201cThe government\u2019s priority is to make the difficult but necessary long-term decisions for the country. Over the last three years, we have invested more than \u00a31.5bn to better protect more than 67,000 homes and businesses. This means that we have protected over 380,000 properties since 2015, and over 600,000 since 2010.\u201cAs has already been set out in the Environment Agency\u2019s annual report, inflationary pressures and delays brought about by the pandemic mean we must look again at the targets set out in our \u00a35.2bn programme. We will consider the National Audit Office\u2019s recommendations as we continue to deliver our record investment to protect hundreds of thousands of homes from floods.\u201d",

With the basic payment scheme falling at that point, we had to take a long hard look at the farm and become more efficient financially. Unfortunately, with the loss of the suckler herd also went the ability to use cows in the landscape as \u201cecosystem engineers\u201d year-round. We had calves coming and going during the year, but no regular workforce of hardy cattle.We had also lost the ability to provide our own beef for our family, so this year I decided to buy some young belted Galloway cattle with a view to building up a small herd. The idea was to become more self-sustainable, provide for our family and sell the excess meat to our neighbours. Besides, my husband had also promised me three hairy cows (hardy native breeds that can survive our climate) as a much-delayed Christmas present, which was cunning of him since he knew I was going to buy them anyway at the Galloway show and sale in Carlisle in March.I pored over the auction catalogue all week, but when the day came, the farmer did not bring the ones I hoped to buy, so I had to dash around all the pens. My son was at home on the farm, so I did a video call as I walked along the pens, showing him what was on offer. We agreed on the ones we wanted, but he said: \u201cYou\u2019ll not get them \u2013 too expensive.\u201dI slid along the benches at the ringside to join a friend I had spotted. \u201cYou don\u2019t have Galloways,\u201d she said, surprised at my attendance. The prices were not great. I saw some lovely cows come and go, but held out for the very last three in the ring. They came in together, and someone outbid me. There was no flexibility in my budget. The buyer could then choose how many of those three cows he wanted at that price. He only wanted one, so the bidding set off again. This time I was bidding against someone online, and thankfully I heard myself saying, \u201cI\u2019ll take them both please,\u201d when the online bidder dropped out.Later that afternoon, two black noses stuck themselves out of the back of the trailer and rushed out into our yard.

        "text": "The UK government has given \u00a320bn more in support to fossil fuel producers than those of renewables since 2015, the Guardian can reveal.The research, commissioned by the Liberal Democrats, found that while renewable energy was given \u00a360bn in support over that time, fossil fuel companies were given close to \u00a380bn.In 2020, renewable energy support was greater than fossil fuel support for the first time. However, fossil fuels have been receiving greater additional investment recently. From 2020 to 2021 they received an extra \u00a31bn support from the government compared with 2020, a 10.7% increase. For renewable energy in the same year, total support for projects increased by just \u00a31m, or 0.01%.Analysis by the House of Commons library found that a fifth of the money given directly to the fossil fuel industry was to support new extraction and mining. In 2021, support for fossil fuel extraction rose by 20% to nearly \u00a32bn.Politicians have asked the government to put net zero at the heart of policy decisions instead of funding fossil fuel corporations.Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat climate and energy spokesperson, said: \u201cIt is extremely alarming that the Conservative government has been giving these staggering amounts to the fossil fuel industry. Not only have the Conservatives failed to properly tax the record profits of the oil and gas giants, they have showered these companies with taxpayer money too.\u201cWe have been through one of the toughest winters on record and the energy crisis is still biting hard. The government squandered the opportunity to shield us from these spiralling energy bills through their lack of long-term thinking. For years, they gave billions to the fossil fuel industry, rather than actually improving our energy security by investing properly in renewables.\u201cThis is just yet more proof of the government\u2019s legacy of failure on climate change. They need to get a grip and start putting net zero at the heart of all our policy decisions. It will grant us the energy-secure, green future we desperately need.\u201dShe added that, when in the coalition government, the Liberal Democrats tripled renewable energy generation, and said the Lib Dems would also end new listings of fossil fuel companies on the London Stock Exchange and require existing fossil fuel companies to set out how they will transition to net zero.Fossil fuel companies have been criticised for not investing sufficiently in renewables, despite getting tax breaks and funding from government. Shell and BP made \u00a332bn and \u00a323bn in profit last year respectively while energy bills rose. Shell invested nearly \u00a310bn into oil and gas projects over the year, compared with just \u00a33bn in its renewable energy division. Similarly, BP has announced that it is scaling back the ambition for its emission-cutting targets. Previously, the fossil fuel producer had said it wanted to cut emissions by 35-40% by 2030, but now it has committed to a 20-30% reduction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The Climate Change Committee themselves have said we\u2019ll still need some fossil fuels as part of our move towards the net zero target, which is why we must ensure we remain an attractive investment for all energy sectors, as we have consistently been for renewables.\u201cOur domestic oil and gas industry have a vital role ensuring energy security and the transition to net zero, and alongside that since 2010 the UK has seen more than a 500% increase in the amount of renewable electricity capacity connected to the grid, making the UK a world leader in offshore wind with the most installed capacity in Europe. This will play a key role in achieving net zero by 2050, and will create thousands of new jobs around the country.\u201d",

But today everything seems to be the same which is unusual \u2026 it\u2019s all evenly warm.\u201cIt is worrying but then other strange things are happening like seaweed accumulating in places it doesn\u2019t normally accumulate. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on \u2026 it must be climate change, mustn\u2019t it?\u201dHedley, who lives in Wylam, Northumberland, was speaking on the day scientists revealed an \u201cunheard of\u201d marine heatwave which has pushed up sea temperatures in the North Sea and north Atlantic.Nathan Henderson, an instructor at Tynemouth surf company, said he hadn\u2019t noticed the sea getting any warmer but would find it worrying if it does. Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianThe temperature rise for the north-east of England is particularly striking and it was concerning for swimmers and surfers out on the beach on Monday lunchtime. But most admitted they have yet to fully notice it.\u201cIt has felt as cold as normal, if I\u2019m honest,\u201d said 23-year-old Nathan Henderson, an instructor at Tynemouth surf company who has been surfing off the coast of north-east England since he was nine.\u201cThe sea here does gradually get warmer from April and the hottest month of the year, in the water, is September. That\u2019s just how it works round here. I\u2019ve not felt the sea getting warmer recently but it\u2019s a worry if it is.\u201dMost people braving the Tynemouth sea on Monday did not dip in above their knees. There was a lot of running in boldly and running out frantically.One fearless soul was Henry Harvey, a 19-year-old footballer for Blyth Town, who was in the sea with two friends. \u201cIt was really cold\u201d, he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s always cold. It\u2019s never warm \u2026 you jump headfirst in and it\u2019s a shock, but it\u2019s good for you.\u201dHarry Harvey (centre), a footballer for Blyth Town, flanked by two friends, said it was always cold and never warm at Tynemouth sea. Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianBarry Henderson has owned Longsands surf school for 12 years and is in the sea practically every day.\u201cWe surf all year and it\u2019s always the same. In winter you surf with boots, gloves and a hood on and as you come into the warmer weather you want to take your boots and gloves off as quick as you can because it\u2019s nicer to surf.\u201cMaybe this year a couple of the younger lads probably had their gloves off quite early but it still has felt bloody freezing. It hasn\u2019t felt massively different.\u201cSome days I\u2019ve gone in and thought the sea\u2019s warming up. I\u2019ve never gone in and thought, \u2018it\u2019s warm\u2019.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say he hasn\u2019t noticed dramatic, apparently unexplainable, changes in temperature over the years.Barry Henderson of Longsands surf school has noticed unexplainable changes in temperature over the years, especially one August when it felt as high as 16 degrees, then dropped again. Photograph: Mark Pinder/The GuardianOne August the temperature felt as high as 16 degrees, he said, and then suddenly it wasn\u2019t. \u201cIt never came back up to that temperature \u2026 it\u2019s strange how it can change like that.\u201dHis surf school overlooks the abandoned wreck of Tynemouth outdoor pool, a place which was notoriously freezing in its heyday because it was filled up with sea water.Henderson has memories of badgering his mother to go in the pool when he was six. \u201cI think it was two pence and I dived straight in and it was just so cold, my breath just completely left me. It was so, so cold.\u201dFor many years there has been a campaign to bring back Tynemouth outdoor pool, which opened in the 1920s and closed with the rise of package holidays in the 1970s. There is much goodwill behind the campaign with support for many predicated on one central part of the proposal: it will be heated.00:03:14What you need to know about the 'extreme' heatwave hitting our oceans \u2013 video explainer",

It found urban and rural services had decreased by 48% and 52% respectively \u2013 with some localities faring worse than others.The findings showed that in Hart, Fenland and Broxtowe there had been a decline of more than 80%. Other constituencies without consistent bus services were North East Hampshire, with an 82% drop in services, and Bridgwater in Somerset, with an 81% decrease. Staffordshire Moorland and Stoke-on-Trent North have experienced the same reduction in services at 78%.Mike Childs, the head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThere has been a silent war on bus users for over a decade. This is not only disproportionately affecting those living on low incomes, people of colour and disabled people, who are less likely to own a car, but people who have had to give up their cars as they have got older due to poor health.\u201dFor the 22% of UK households without access to cars, buses are crucial. The smooth running of services also helps to lower car use, reducing carbon emissions in highly congested urban areas.Of the 100 constituencies with the greatest decline in bus services, 82 have a Conservative MP. This contrasts with analysis of bus services in London, which have stayed at similar levels for the past 15 years.The data found urban areas outside the UK capital had an average of 14 buses an hour, whereas in London the hourly average was 120.Friends of the Earth has called on all political parties to ensure a manifesto pledge for what it calls a \u201cpublic transport renaissance\u201d.

His recipes are great fun and, importantly, they work, too.It\u2019s miraculous what the liquid from a tin of chickpeas is capable of, and these clever aquafaba doughnuts are a case in point. The aquafaba binds the dough, which puffs up into delicious, pillowy treats. I\u2019ve tweaked Richard\u2019s original recipe to make these doughnuts a whole food, and even made with wholegrain flour they are light and fluffy.They\u2019re best eaten fresh, so fry only as many asyou want to eat at a time. If need be, prove the rolled doughnuts in the fridge overnight or even freeze them (remove from the fridge or freezer and, when fully defrosted and doubled in size, they\u2019ll be ready to fry).Save any leftover oil for cooking other foods or to fry your next batch of doughnuts. Once cool, strain it through a fine sieve and/or a clean cloth, seal in a clean container and store. Use up any leftover cinnamon sugar, too, in a cup of chai or sprinkled over cereal.Richard fills his cooked doughnuts with a scrumptious jam made with doughnut peaches, but experiment with your own fillings \u2013 my maple apple butter from last week goes really well with them, too.Makes 10 mini doughnuts150g wholemeal bread flour80g fine plain wholemeal flour, plus extra for dusting2 tbsp unrefined sugar2 tsp easy-bake yeast\u00bd tsp sea salt2 tbsp (30g) extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for deep-frying160g aquafaba (ie, the liquid from 1 tin of chickpeas)50g unrefined sugar \u2013 I used rapadura sugar, but any will do1 tsp ground cinnamon (optional)In a stand mixer or bowl, combine the bread flour, plain flour, yeast and salt. Stir in the two tablespoons of oil and the aquafaba, and knead in the bowl for 10 minutes, until the dough turns from sticky to smooth and strong. Cover and leave to rise for an hour, until doubled in size.Tip the dough on to a lightly floured surface, cut and shape into 10 balls, then space them well apart. Cover with a cloth and leave to prove for another hour, or doubled in size. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix the sugar and ground cinnamon, if using.Put a small saucepan filled with 2cm oil on a medium heat, and bring up to 170C (if you don\u2019t have a temperature probe, drop in a crumb of bread: when it bubbles to the surface, the oil should be ready).

While our work to secure the future of this population of chequered skipper continues, we are delighted to be able to reveal their location so that butterfly enthusiasts can come and enjoy spotting them in the wild in England for the first time in more than 40 years.\u201dWhile the chequered skipper is flourishing again thanks to the Back from the Brink project, Susannah O\u2019Riordan, the chequered skipper project manager for Butterfly Conservation, said they hoped the butterfly would expand further across its traditional stronghold of Rockingham Forest in Northamptonshire. The chequered skipper\u2019s only other British population is in the Highlands of Scotland.\u201cIt\u2019s always a work in progress and we\u2019ve still got to maintain the population size,\u201d said O\u2019Riordan. \u201cThey are such a difficult butterfly to monitor because they are so fast, and sneaky about where they are. We\u2019re definitely only seeing a proportion of the population on site.\u201dThe butterfly typically emerges at the end of May and visitors to Fineshade Wood will be supervised by two \u201cskipper rangers\u201d as well as Butterfly Conservation volunteers and Forestry England staff. Visitors are being urged to stick to marked footpaths and not trample long grass, which the butterfly\u2019s caterpillars feed on.\u201cIt can be a problem if people aren\u2019t respectful of their habitat,\u201d said O\u2019Riordan. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been doing a lot of management in nearby woodland and we hope as numbers increase that the butterfly will colonise some of the additional woodlands in the area. That\u2019s always been our aim through the project \u2013 to create lots of habitat for the chequered skipper to colonise naturally. There\u2019s a lot more open habitat and sunny spaces for the butterfly to expand into.\u201d\nWild Green Wonders by Patrick Barkham (Guardian Faber, \u00a314.99).

        "text": "With their spiky crowns of leaves, pineapples are about as close as you can get to a tropical paradise while doing the weekly shop \u2013 but now Sainsbury\u2019s has begun selling the fruit shorn of its exotic plumage, all in the name of cutting food waste.With the fruit\u2019s hardy leaves usually ending up in the bin or a food waste caddy, the move shines a spotlight on waste in the home. So could the leaves, stems and skins of the fruit and vegetables we routinely throw away be put to better use in the kitchen?Pineapple crownsSainsbury\u2019s says the crowns will be replanted or shredded for animal feed, eliminating a huge 700 tonnes of waste a year. So if you regularly buy the fruit elsewhere, it is worth considering what you could do with the leftovers.If you are green fingered you could replant the crown and nurture a pineapple houseplant. But don\u2019t expect fruit salad any time soon, as growing a pineapple will take two to three years, according to Chestnut Hill Farms. The grower\u2019s list of \u201cunexpected ways to use a pineapple crown\u201d offers other ideas with a quicker payback, such as using the leaves to make tea.The Irish chef Conor Spacey, whose book Wasted is full of recipes that use commonly thrown away foods, suggests using the peel and core to make the Mexican drink Tepache. The potion (peel, plus brown sugar, water and cinnamon) self-carbonates into a refreshing fizzy drink that can also be used as a cocktail mixer.Banana skinsThere is a lot more to banana skins than pranks, with an abundance of recipes for this afterthought thanks to the Nigella Lawson effect. In 2020 the TV cook caused a stir with her banana skin and cauliflower curry, telling viewers that people \u201cassume it\u2019s aubergine\u201d. Another twist is Nadiya Hussain\u2019s banana peel burgers, which she says taste like pulled pork.You can store peels in your freezer until inspiration strikes. Bakers say cooking and pureeing skins to add into the batter results in a superior banana cake, while Spacey advocates turning them into chutney.Vegetable peelings\u201cCould anything be more zero-waste than a salty sauce made of vegetable peelings that would otherwise be bound for the compost bin full of vegetable scraps?\u201d asks the chef Tom Hunt in his Waste not column. With the help of koji (fermented rice or soya bean mix) and salt, veg peelings including onion skins and spent coffee grounds can be transformed into garum, an ancient Roman sauce likened to Worcestershire or fish sauce.Another tactic is to avoid peeling veg in the first place. \u201cMany root vegetables don\u2019t need to be peeled; just give them a good scrub clean before using,\u201d suggests Sam Hubble, a specialist in behaviour change at the climate action NGO Wrap.When Hubble does end up with a mound of veg peelings he has a couple of tricks up his sleeve including vegetable peel soup, which he insists is \u201ctastier than it sounds\u201d. There is a recipe for potato peel soup on the Love Food Hate Waste website. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to experiment with different concoctions; my favourite is to also throw in some sweet potato peelings.\u201d His other go-to recipe is vegetable peel crisps. \u201cI\u2019ve used potato, carrot and parsnip peels to make really moreish, crispy snacks.\u201dCarrot tops (and other leaves and stems)\u201cThink of a vegetable the same way you would if it was a piece of meat: butcher it into parts and ensure you use everything,\u201d Spacey tells home cooks trying to cut food waste. Today more supermarkets sell whole carrots, with the tops good in salads, pasta or turned into a pesto, he says. Take a similar approach with brussels sprouts; if you buy whole plants, eat the stem and tops too, with cooks advised to roast them. You can do the same with the fibrous stems of other veg such as broccoli, chard and kale. And don\u2019t jettison tough cabbage leaves. Borrow from the eastern European tradition and use them up along with leftover rice in a layered pie.Citrus peelA shrivelled mound of citrus skins might look like a dead end, but they can be used in a myriad of ways including to inject zing into cocktails and desserts. For starters there\u2019s the bartender\u2019s secret ingredient, the easy-to-make oleo saccharum (citrus peel syrup by its less fancy name). It can be used in cocktails, mixed into salads or used as a glaze for meat. You can also use other fruit peelings, such as pineapple, banana, mango or apple to make syrups. Alternatively, use lemon rinds to make your own limoncello or, with Christmas in mind, use old citrus peel to make mulled wine spice pouches.",

        "text": "If Australia seizes the opportunity offered by the world\u2019s transition to zero net emissions it can repeat the experience of the China resources boom that peaked about 10 years ago. But this time the opportunity can be sustained for some decades \u2013 rather than boom and bust \u2013 and we can manage it better for productivity and broadly based development.The logic is simple.Australia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of gas and coal taken together. Many focus on the costs of losing what has been our large comparative advantage. But two key points are often overlooked.First, Australia has the world\u2019s best combinations of wind and solar energy resources, and it has enormous sources of biomass for a zero emissions chemical industry.Think about that.Renewable energy growth must double to meet Australia\u2019s emission goals, Clean Energy Council saysRead moreThe world is moving to a zero emissions economy \u2013 albeit at an uncertain speed \u2013 and we can have the lowest-cost zero emissions electricity available for large scale economic development in the world.Second, we have among the largest resources of the minerals needed in the energy transition. Renewable energy is not easily exported so it makes sense for industry to relocate to the source. Put simply, more of Australia\u2019s minerals should now be processed in Australia.Australia\u2019s advantages relative to the rest of the world are so significant that using them on a large scale would materially improve the prospects of achieving the world\u2019s climate objectives.A net zero Australian economy will reduce global emissions by just over 1%. But if Australia successfully seizes the economic advantage in exporting zero-emissions goods then this can reduce global emissions by around another 7%.Australia covers about 5% of the Earth\u2019s land surface; supplying about 8% of the world\u2019s renewable energy is no stretch given our abundant solar, wind and land resources.\nSign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads\nGiven all this, I am disappointed when I too often see discussion of the economy separate from discussion of the energy superpower transition.Dealing with the fundamental change that the transition requires should no longer be a side issue \u2013 or worse, an issue concerning the costs and difficulties involved in dealing with climate change.Australia can have more employment and higher incomes in the relatively short term, and be much richer in the longer term, by moving early and decisively in building and expanding the zero emissions economy.Not only is the transition consistent with a rising standard of living for Australians, it is perhaps also necessary for this to be achieved.Let\u2019s consider some of the opportunities that could drive this.First, the direct reduction of iron ore to iron metal using green hydrogen, even extending to green steel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Five Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

For example, methanol as a shipping fuel is now ready technologically.Third, using green hydrogen to make ammonia, which can be used for the production of nitrogenous fertilisers and explosives for Australia\u2019s agriculture and mining industries, as well as for export.Fourth, the mining and green processing of other energy transition minerals, such as copper, graphite and rare earths.Fifth, metallurgical recycling focused on green energy waste, including from depleted batteries, wind turbines and solar panels.Sixth, planting naturally adapted tree species, such as the mallee, in marginal farming country.

        "text": "A third of UK teenagers believe climate change is \u201cexaggerated\u201d, a report has found, as YouTube videos promoting a new kind of climate denial aimed at young people proliferate on the platform.Previously, most climate deniers pushed the belief that climate breakdown was not happening or, if it was, that humans were not causing it. Now, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) has found that most climate denial videos on YouTube push the idea that climate solutions do not work, climate science and the climate movement are unreliable, or that the effects of global heating are beneficial or harmless.Researchers from the CCDH gathered a dataset of text transcripts from 12,058 climate-related YouTube videos posted by 96 channels over almost six years from 1 January 2018 to 30 September 2023. They also included the results of a nationally representative survey conducted by polling company Survation which found 31% of UK respondents aged 13 to 17 agreed with the statement \u201cClimate change and its effects are being purposefully overexaggerated\u201d. This rose to 37% of teenagers categorised as heavy users of social media, meaning they reported using any one platform for more than four hours a day.The report published on Tuesday shows a shift from the \u201cold denial\u201d \u2013 that climate change is not happening or not anthropogenic \u2013 to the \u201cnew denial\u201d.These new denial narratives that question the science and solutions for climate change constituted 35% of all climate denial on YouTube in 2018, but now represent the large majority (70%). Over the same period, the share of old denial has dropped from 65% to 30% of total claims.The report authors believe that this shift is because the scientific evidence is now more accepted and hard to dispute, so those aiming to win people over to climate denial and delay must discredit the solutions and people pushing for climate action.Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the CCDH, said: \u201cScientists have won the battle to inform the public about climate change and its causes, which is why those opposed to climate action have cynically switched focus to undermining confidence in solutions and in science itself.\u201dThis mentality has seeped into UK politics, with rightwing politicians having campaigned for years to persuade the public that net zero is unachievable and too expensive, and that technologies including electric cars and heat pumps do not work. The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has said recently that climate solutions are too expensive and rowed back on net zero commitments.Young people are particularly heavy users of YouTube \u2013 the Pew Research Center recently found 13- to 17-year-olds use YouTube more than any other social media platform, with 71% using it daily.Examples highlighted by the report of channels which push these new denial messages include the online figure Jordan Peterson (7.64 million subscribers), and channels such as BlazeTV (1.92 million subscribers) and PragerU (3.21 million subscribers).Ahmed added: \u201cYoung people spend a huge amount of time on video-sharing platforms like YouTube. These new forms of climate denial, which have proliferated rapidly over the last six years, are designed to confuse and weaken public support for climate action in the coming decades.\u201cIt is hypocritical for social media companies to claim to be green but then monetise and amplify lies about the climate.\u201cIt is time for digital platforms to put their money where their mouth is. They should refuse to amplify or monetise cynical climate denial content that undermines faith in our collective capacity to solve humanity\u2019s most pressing challenge.\u201dGraphicYouTube and Google, which owns the video platform, have been urged to stop promoting climate disinformation on their platforms. The report found that large brands and non-profits had paid-for adverts next to many of the widely viewed videos containing new denial messages.Michael Khoo, a climate disinformation expert at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cBig tech fuels the spread of denial that is stopping climate action. We\u2019ve pressured Google to stop supporting climate denial in the past, but they\u2019ve done little. The New Climate Denial report shows a disturbing shift in the tactics used by bad actors to derail the action needed to avert further disaster.\u201cPlatforms like YouTube have developed technology to monopolise young people\u2019s attention and shouldn\u2019t direct that towards climate denial. All social media companies must stop amplifying and profiting off the climate denial that threatens action on the most pressing crisis of human history.\u201dA YouTube spokesperson said: \u201cOur climate change policy prohibits ads from running on content that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change. Debate or discussions of climate change topics, including around public policy or research, is allowed. However, when content crosses the line to climate change denial, we stop showing ads on those videos. We also display information panels under relevant videos to provide additional information on climate change and context from third parties.\u201d",

The East Atlantic Flyway links bird migration routes from the Arctic Circle to southern Africa via western Europe.\u201cIt\u2019s migration season, so these outbreaks threaten birds and poultry all the way from Africa to Europe and the UK,\u201d said Sacha Dench, founder of Conservation Without Borders and an ambassador for the UN\u2019s Convention on Migratory Species, who saw more than 500 dead seabirds at two sites last week at the Tanji bird reserve.\u201cThe local conservation organisation [Wabsa] is expected to respond yet can\u2019t even afford the \u00a324 boat fuel to go to Bijol Islands,\u201d Dench said. \u201cThe cost of it spreading is so much more than simply surveillance and control by good field workers.\u201dMany low- to-middle-income countries have limited conservation funds, she added. \u201cMost rely on international funding and some money from tourism to pay for the services of local park staff. But when an emergency like bird flu hits, the government has priorities like chicken being important protein for local people.\u201cRapid reaction is critical. So having staff on the ground with the resources that enable them to act is essential,\u201d said Dench, who secured temporary funds for the boat fuel. She has written to ask the UK government to help fund the surveillance and disposal of infected birds, a critical matter for the government at a time when the UK\u2019s bird flu restrictions on free-range poultry are only just being lifted.Death of thousands of wild birds from avian flu is \u2018new Silent Spring\u2019Read more\u201cInvesting in monitoring activities in developing countries would save a lot of birds we love, and could save [the poultry farming] industry a lot of money,\u201d said Dench, who hopes that other national governments could also support the Gambia\u2019s avian flu recovery efforts. \u201cThis is more than conservation, this is management of a global pandemic, and we should at least be offering assistance to those with less resources on the migration flyways that the UK sits right at the centre of.\u201dFagimba Camara, head of the research unit at Wabsa, who has been monitoring the Bijol Islands and digging holes in the sand to bury dead birds, says that minimising spread of infection is a \u201cbig task\u201d.\u201cThis is the most important place for migratory species in the Gambia because we record so many in large numbers, including royal terns, Caspian terns, ruddy turnstones and osprey, which fly from Scotland and other parts of Europe for their wintering time.\u201d At the beginning of the month, Camara found 246 dead birds. This week, his team found 107, mainly royal terns. \u201cAt least we are seeing the number of affected birds decreasing [on Bijol Islands],\u201d he said, although numbers are increasing elsewhere in the Gambia.Awa Joof, research officer for Wabsa, said: \u201cThe most difficult thing to do is dig bird graves, so it is definitely so sad for me to see birds dying in such large numbers.\u201dFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

Ilkley Clean River Group said the plans were ambitious in their timescale, aiming for improvements to be taking shape in 2026.\u201cThis is what our years of citizen science, water testing, bathing status and holding agencies to account has got us. We are really pleased,\u201d said Becky Malby of the Ilkley Clean River Group. \u201cOur river is a precious resource for local people, visitors and wildlife. The collective effort of the Environment Agency, Ofwat, Yorkshire Water and local people has produced a solution that radically reduces sewage discharges and improves the quality of the water in our river now and for the future.\u201dStarmer accuses government of \u2018turning Britain\u2019s waterways into an open sewer\u2019Read moreThe public outcry over the discharge of raw sewage into rivers has become a major political issue, with Keir Starmer accusing the government of \u201cturning Britain\u2019s waterways into an open sewer\u201d last week. The latest data from the Environment Agency (EA) showed on Friday that discharges of raw sewage from storm overflows into English rivers and coastal waters happened 825 times a day last year.United Utilities, which covers the north-west of England, was responsible for 69,000 spills last year, including a site in Cumbria that discharged sewage more than 300 times.On Tuesday the government will announce a \u201cplan for water\u201d that it claims will set out how to achieve cleaner and more plentiful water. The scale of problems ranges from pollution of every English river from sewage and agricuture, to the reality of water shortages as the climate crisis leads to droughts across the UK. The EA has recently heavily criticised plans by Thames Water to find new water sources in Wales and from the River Thames.The Ilkley improvement is one of several projects designed to cut raw sewage overflows from the 15,000 storm overflows that pour diluted waste into English rivers. They are supposed to be used in exceptional circumstances but are being used routinely by water companies. In 2022, EA figures show, raw sewage was discharged into rivers for more than 1.75m hours.Ofwat said the investment would ensure improvements were made more quickly \u201cto address the unacceptable levels of pollution in waterways\u201d.Projects to cut sewage discharges from storm overflows include United Utilities reducing discharges into Windermere as it cuts about 8,400 spills a year, says Ofwat.South West Water will spend \u00a370m upgrading storage and infrastructure to cut discharges into coastal waters and rivers in Falmouth and Sidmouth, and Anglian is spending \u00a327m to reduce discharges from its storm overflows.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Two environmental defenders have been shot dead in broad daylight in Honduras, triggering fresh calls for an independent investigation into the persecution and violence against a rural community battling to stop an illegally sanctioned mine.Aly Dom\u00ednguez, 38, and Jairo Bonilla, 28, from Guapinol in northern Honduras, were murdered on Saturday afternoon as they returned home on a moped after finishing work collecting payments for a cable company. They were intercepted by armed assailants and died at the scene, according to relatives.How Honduras became one of the most dangerous countries to defend natural resourcesRead moreDom\u00ednguez and Bonilla were co-founders of Guapinol\u2019s grassroots resistance against an iron ore mine owned by one of the country\u2019s most powerful couples. Dom\u00ednguez was among 32 community leaders falsely accused of crimes by the mining company and local authorities.Local police and prosecutors immediately ascribed the deaths to a botched mugging \u2013 even though the assailants fled without taking the victims\u2019 moped, cellphones or money.UN agencies, rights groups and the US embassy condemned the killings. Relatives and lawyers have questioned the official version of events, pointing to the ongoing threats and harassment faced by the community.\u201cWe reject the official hypothesis. These two young men were founders of the struggle to protect our natural resources from an illegal mine that is destroying rivers in the national park. For five years we\u2019ve been threatened, criminalised and falsely imprisoned, the only thing left was murder,\u201d said Rey Dom\u00ednguez, 58, a community leader and Aly\u2019s brother.\u201cIt\u2019s vital that an independent impartial investigation is carried out which must take into account the possibility that Aly and Jairo have been retaliated against for their work defending human rights,\u201d said Michael Phoenix, head of research for the UN special rapporteur for human rights defenders.The Guapinol case stems from a huge open-pit mine in nearby Tocoa, which was authorised inside a protected national park in a process mired by legal irregularities, according to international experts. Community members, including Dom\u00ednguez and Bonilla, set up a peaceful protest camp after the mine polluted rivers relied upon by thousands of people.Security forces violently evicted the encampment and dozens of arrest warrants were issued against the protesters. Rey and Aly Dom\u00ednguez spent time in jail on bogus charges in 2019. International legal and human rights experts widely condemned the criminalization of the activists and the subsequent militarization of the community, which forced several people to flee and seek asylum in the US.The mine was among hundreds of environmentally destructive extractive projects greenlit by National party leaders, several of whom now face drugs and arms trafficking charges in the US. After 2009, Honduras became one of the most dangerous countries in the world to defend natural resources.The highest-profile victim was the Indigenous defender Berta C\u00e1ceres, who was assassinated in March 2016 after suffering years of threats and harassment linked to her opposition to an internationally funded dam.The post-coup regime ended a year ago, when Xiomara Castro, the wife of Manuel Zelaya, the president ousted in 2009, came to power promising to reinstate the rule of law and protect defenders.Initially, there were high hopes after the supreme court freed Guapinol leaders who had been convicted on bogus charges. But the mine continues to operate, and the community have reported ongoing police harassment.Joaqu\u00edn Mej\u00eda, a prominent Honduran human rights lawyer, said the new government was partially responsible for the murders as it had failed to suspend or cancel the illegal mining concessions granted by the former regime.Phoenix said: \u201cXiomara Castro came into government promising to protect human rights defenders. The imposition of extractive projects on communities without their consent is one of the root causes of attacks against defenders in Central America, but where there is political will, governments can address it. The Honduran government must do more.\u201d",

It\u2019s kind of our achilles heel really \u2013 three years ago we lost 10,000 tonnes of soil in 10 minutes. I am just full of shame for that. It happened on my watch, I don\u2019t want to be responsible for it happening again.\u201dSingh-Watson said he has enjoyed his recent foray into growing nuts, and loves them so much that he eats them for breakfast every morning. He said they were easy to grow: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything, I spent 40 years trying to coax vegetables into life and they just die all the time, but hazels grow so well. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any problem growing walnuts in our climate.\u201dHe has had success grazing cattle in the orchards, and now plans to grow kale among some of his hazel trees.England\u2019s climate is heating up, with last year the hottest on record, with a long, dry summer. This is making many crops difficult to grow, and many farmers reported crop failures during the drought.Though they sometimes need irrigation when first planted, nut trees do well in warm weather and can survive dry summers. Singh-Watson said he had recently visited Piedmont in Italy, where hazelnuts are a major crop \u2013 it is home to Ferrero, the company that makes Nutella. Despite the hot, dry summer in Italy, the nuts were flourishing.Tom Tame, who has been growing walnuts in Warwickshire for 30 years, said the hotter, drier climate was helping.Though walnuts grow all the way up to the Arctic Circle, he explained \u201cwalnuts will happily grow in colder conditions but farther north you are going to get less of a crop. In this country, we\u2019re on the cusp of what works commercially\u201d.The sector was exciting, he said, because English walnuts are considered to be particularly high quality and in demand. Farmers are increasingly growing them in order to shelter livestock such as sheep from hot weather while also producing a profitable crop.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We hit 24.8C on average last summer, so we\u2019re finally getting into that territory.\u201dCobnuts are a type of hazelnut grown in Kent, and traditionally eaten fresh, rather than dried. Tom Cannon, whose family farm in the county has been growing these nuts for generations, is upping production and expanding into the types of dried hazelnuts you might find in a chocolate bar.He currently supplies fresh nuts to Waitrose and Morrisons: \u201cThey go into punnets, and that\u2019s a nice way to sell them because it makes the point that it is a fresh nut. We\u2019ve started getting more equipment for taking the husks off, roasting them and cracking them. In Kent we\u2019ve had this fresh eating culture but we haven\u2019t necessarily done the other things.\u201d",

        "text": "Senior Tories have privately voiced fears about a slew of concessions made by Rishi Sunak to rebels on planning, the environment and online safety, suggesting counter-rebellions may have to be organised.Several former ministers have suggested they are worried about Sunak\u2019s strategy and said the prime minister could find himself trapped between two wings of his party. Potential flash points include the retained EU law bill, the economic crime bill and the finance bill after the spring budget.One warned that Sunak would risk seeing counter-rebellions emerging that could reignite old party tensions if the same concessions were seen on other issues such as Brexit, taxation or planning.\u201cWe cannot have a situation where the prime minister is so frightened of his own party that 30 colleagues can get him to change his mind about anything,\u201d one former cabinet minister said.Another former minister, a supporter of Sunak, said the prime minister was on shaky ground because he derived his mandate from Conservative MPs, rather than the party or from the electorate. \u201cLosing a vote is effectively a confidence thing,\u201d they said. \u201cRelying on Labour votes to push anything through starts to raise all sorts of questions.\u201dMinister refuses to rule out changes to UK online safety billRead moreOn Monday Sunak caved into demands from Tory rebels who had signed an amendment to the online harms bill that social media bosses could face criminal charges and even jail over content on their platforms.\u201cIt is genuinely bonkers,\u201d one former minister said of the change. Sunak, however, was risking potential defeat because Labour had backed the change to the bill, which is to be tabled when it reaches the House of Lords.The levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, made two significant concessions to rebels last year \u2013 including relaxing regulations on onshore wind in a rebellion that was also backed by Labour.But the other concession was to drop mandatory building targets after a rebellion was threatened by at least 50 Conservative MPs, despite Labour saying it would not back the amendment. The Guardian revealed this week that thousands of new homes are at risk after a series of local authorities cut or delayed their housebuilding plans after the decision.Some experienced Conservative MPs said Sunak had exposed a potentially fatal weakness by not facing down the group. \u201cI think there are a number of us who regret not mounting a counter-rebellion on that issue,\u201d one said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines UKFree newsletterGet the day\u2019s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If only life were so simple.These claims \u2013 which bombard us in the supermarkets, online and on television \u2013 are often based on carbon credits approved by Verra, the world\u2019s leading certifier for the $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) voluntary offsets market. Disney, Gucci and Shell are just some of the names that use them, and they are presented as a \u201cnature-based solution\u201d to the guilt that many of us feel about our emissions and contribution to biodiversity loss.Now, after the Guardian\u2019s joint investigation into the rainforest credits, which indicated that many of them are worthless and often do not prevent any deforestation at all, the non-profit is making major changes to its rainforest offsets programme. It has committed to phasing out the current methods for producing credits by July 2025 at the latest. This had been promised for a long time, but we now have an end date.We should be cautious about the reforms and what they mean for ethical shoppers who want to do the right thing. Insiders in the carbon offsetting industry \u2013 which is unregulated \u2013 paint a picture of bizarre world that brings together the oil and gas industry, conservationists, governments, financiers, Silicon Valley and UN climate conferences.Insiders say conflicts of interest are rife and experts say scandals show the industry is at the beginning of a \u201ccredibility revolution\u201d, a reference to an economic movement that applied empirical methods to the social sciences and was recognised with a Nobel prize in 2021.\u201cA credibility revolution that began in the late 80s has swept through social sciences. That has unearthed new findings about what the impacts of welfare are on people\u2019s willingness to work, environmental regulations, tax quality and a whole range of things. Now that credibility revolution is arriving at the door of carbon offsetting and the news isn\u2019t very encouraging,\u201d said Michael Greenstone, a professor at the University of Chicago and Barack Obama\u2019s former chief economist, who researches the impact of environmental policies.Methods for measuring impact, which is crucial to offsetting\u2019s \u201ccancelling out\u201d logic, are used all the time in other fields. We can estimate the impact of the Covid-19 vaccines, German reunification and ETA terrorist attacks. Now, they are being applied to conservation and were used in the studies the Guardian analysed for its investigation.There are big questions about the ability of offsetting to play even a minor role in climate change and biodiversity loss mitigation, and regulators in the EU, US and UK are started to take note. Offsetting projects involving whales and elephants could soon join their rainforest protection counterparts but there could soon be strict new rules about what businesses can say is \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d using offsets in many countries. Whatever is allowed, we do not have time to waste on ideas that do not work.Guido Imbens, one of the Nobel laureate economists recognised in 2021, reviewed the Guardian\u2019s analysis after Verra and a carbon credit marketing claimed the studies were flawed and unable to capture the true impact of the projects.He said he found nothing that took away from the overall conclusions of the investigation, but cautioned that estimating how the world would have been \u2013 which is what the carbon projects attempt to do \u2013 is inherently complicated and sensitive to analytical choices.We will have to live with this uncertainty if offsetting is scaled up, and it will never be a substitute for cutting emissions. Better data on forests and deforestation, and embracing modern methods for estimating impact, must be the way forward if carbon markets are going to be scaled up.We also must not forget that the investigation found evidence of forced clearances at one projects. Indigenous leaders across the Amazon warned that they were being targeted by \u201ccarbon pirates\u201d trying to cash in on the offsetting goldrush.We desperately need a system that protects rainforest and human rights at its heart.

Right now the expansion of electricity production in Sweden is through wind power,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI don\u2019t expect any new nuclear power in Sweden, unless the government provides quite far-reaching guarantees similar to what you have at Hinkley Point [in the UK].\u201dThe move was more about posturing than action, he said, claiming the government wanted to show it was taking action on meeting its climate goals. \u201cI see it more as symbolic than actually creating any real change.\u201dIf the reactors were built the costs were likely to fall heavily on the Swedish taxpayer, said Nilsson. Having been a hotly debated issue in the past, this latest announcement had had a \u201clukewarm response\u201d.Sweden\u2019s reputation as a green leader on the global stage was shifting, he said. \u201cSweden will partly lose that profile.

Two other candidates, Tim Scott and Nikki Haley, accepted the well-established scientific reality of global heating but looked to shift the blame to other major carbon polluters, such as China, and even, in Scott\u2019s case, to Africa, which is responsible for about 3% of the world\u2019s emissions.Benji Backer, founder and executive chairman of ACC, said the question on climate was \u201chistoric\u201d and highlighted the desire among young Republicans for their leaders to take the threat of global heating seriously.\u201cThat we didn\u2019t get an immediate hand raise speaks to how much work we have left to do; young people will never vote for a candidate that doesn\u2019t believe in climate change,\u201d he said after the debate. \u201cWe\u2019re not going away, we are normalizing this as part of the Republican conversation. Republicans deserve to lose if they are climate deniers and don\u2019t have a plan.\u201dBacker said that Ramaswamy \u201chas always been wrong on this issue\u201d and that Haley\u2019s answer was a \u201cwinning one\u201d for young people. He noted how Ramaswamy, who he said an ACC colleague confronted about his remarks after the debate, was booed by the audience for his dismissal of climate science.\u201cRepublicans are environmentalists, we are the original conservationists,\u201d Backer told a debate after-party attended by campaign staffers, some Republican members of Congress and Ramaswamy, a video shared with the Guardian shows. \u201cAnd by sitting on the sidelines and letting the Democrats take this issue and run with it over the last few decades we\u2019ve not only lost an entire generation of young voters we\u2019ve also ceded the ground to really, really bad policy that is impacting our day-to-day lives in so many ways.\u201dPolling shows there is growing concern among all Americans over the impacts of the climate crisis, which have been on vivid display this summer, with devastating fires in Hawaii, floods in California and Vermont and a series of punishing heatwaves that have broken temperature records across the US.There remains a partisan divide, however, with far more Democrats considering climate a priority than Republicans. Among GOP voters, younger people are more likely to see the climate crisis as a threat that requires action than the party\u2019s older voters, polls suggest.Few Republican leaders have backed strong climate action in recent years, however, with Trump, the dominant force in the party, calling the climate crisis a \u201choax\u201d and \u201cbullshit\u201d. During Trump\u2019s presidency, the US withdrew from the Paris climate agreement and scrapped various regulations designed to reduce carbon pollution. Republicans in Congress have since attempted to demolish key aspects of Joe Biden\u2019s landmark Inflation Reduction Act, which provides enormous incentives to proliferate renewable energy and electric vehicles.Republican hopefuls shrug when asked about climate crisis during debateRead moreThe specter of Trump, the clear frontrunner for the Republican nomination despite his various criminal indictments, still haunts Republicans when it comes to dealing with the climate crisis, according to Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman who now advocates for conservative action on climate.\u201cAt the debate last night the future called to the present and the present seized up in fear \u2013 the candidates couldn\u2019t answer the future\u2019s call because they are in fear of a certain constituency in the party and the person who leads that,\u201d Inglis said.\u201cIt\u2019s an abysmal failure of vision. The smart money is moving towards innovation to deal with climate change. But that guy [Trump] is an angel of death. He can\u2019t get you elected, but he can kill you in the primary.\u201dEnvironmental groups were scathing of the Republican candidate\u2019s responses. \u201cRepublicans are stuck between a hoax and a hard place,\u201d said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power. \u201cTheir Maga base demands a rigid stance against the obvious reality of climate change, which requires that they ignore what we\u2019re all experiencing \u2013 extreme weather that disrupts lives and destroys communities week in and week out.\u201d",

Under government plans, homes with \u201coff-grid\u201d gas connections will be banned from buying replacement boilers from 2026 and instead expected to install air source or ground source heat pump systems.But Eustice, the Conservative MP for Camborne and Redruth, will on Wednesday argue in parliament that the costs involved in installing heat pumps in older rural properties present a \u201chuge barrier\u201d. Instead, Eustice said, kerosene oil boilers can run on \u201chydro-treated vegetable oil\u201d (HVO) with a \u201cminor adaptation\u201d and reduce related greenhouse gas emissions by 88%.Eustice told the Guardian: \u201cThe government has pursued a heat-pump-first strategy but the cost to some households is prohibitively expensive, and will create a whole new industry of patching up old boilers. A good option is being overlooked here in favour of the best option, but if emissions can be reduced significantly and quickly it makes sense.\u201dEustice has called for an extension of the Renewable Transport FuelObligation that requires major fuel manufacturers or importers to purchase a proportion of their fuel from renewable sources. Eustice wants to see the system, which in effect subsidises renewable fuel, extended to suppliers of fuel for homes.He hopes there will be an amendment to the energy bill, which sets out large-scale changes for the industry and is being scrutinised by the House of Lords.Eustice said: \u201cThis system means less waste of resources because the fuel can run on existing boilers and central heating infrastructure with a simple, low-cost adaptation to the boiler.\u201dConsumers with off-grid heating voiced concerns over the sharp rise in energy bills last year. Households in Great Britain using alternative fuels such as biomass or heating oil have been offered a \u00a3200 \u201calternative fuel payment\u201d, which was announced in December.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "A devastating 2005 flood that killed 1,000 people in the Indian city of Mumbai was blamed on a tragically simple problem: plastic bags had blocked storm drains, stopping monsoon flood water from draining out of the city.Now a new report, attempting to quantify this problem, estimates that 218 million of the world\u2019s poorest people are at risk from more severe and frequent flooding caused by plastic waste.The number is equivalent to the population of the UK, France and Germany combined. About 41 million of those are children, older people and people with disabilities, the report found. Three-quarters of those most at risk live in south-east Asia and the Pacific region.Researchers from Resource Futures, an environmental consultancy, and Tearfund, an international Christian charity, found that communities in Cameroon, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ghana, Bangladesh and Indonesia had experienced more severe flooding due to plastic waste blocking drainage systems in the last few years. In these communities, plastic waste was a \u201crisk multiplier\u201d for flooding, they said.A tide of plastic waste clogs waterways in Sylhet, Bangladesh, after floods last July. Photograph: Future Publishing/Getty ImagesTo identify those most at risk, they used a study of flood risk and poverty published in 2022 by Jun Rentschler and others that identified 1.8 billion people at high risk of flooding in 188 nations. They narrowed their analysis to only low and middle-income countries with inadequate urban drainage, solid waste management and sanitation. To focus on the populations most at risk from plastic exacerbating the flood risk, they also excluded countries with mismanaged waste of less than 1kg for each person a year, and focused on urban slums.Rich Gower, a senior economist and policy associate at Tearfund, said: \u201cAround the world, from Brazil to the DRC, from Malawi to Bangladesh, we see plastic pollution making floods worse. Without decisive action, this problem is only going to get worse.\u201dPlastic waste pollution has doubled in the last decade, and is predicted to triple by 2060. Only 9% is recycled globally.Gower said: \u201cThe aim of the report is to give an order of magnitude to the number of people at risk. What we are saying is that plastic pollution affects the poorest, most marginalised communities the most. We\u2019ve seen it with plastic burning, and we are now seeing it with flood risk. These communities bear the brunt of plastic pollution.\u201dA drainage canal pictured last summer in Lagos, Nigeria, tells the story of global plastic pollution. Photograph: Pius Utomi Ekpei/AFP/Getty ImagesThe authors stressed the limitations of the estimate. It was based on the best available data, they said, admitting that \u201cdetailed data on impacts of plastic-aggravated flooding is not available\u201d. Neither, they said, was there sufficient modelling of the links between plastic pollution, flooding and health. But they had applied \u201cmultiple conservative assumptions and sense-checks\u201d, and considered the estimate \u201crealistic and conservative\u201d, they said.Gower urged governments, which will come together in Paris next week to begin negotiations on a legally binding plastics treaty, to consider these worst-affected communities. \u201cThrough the plastics treaty, world leaders have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to end this crisis by driving down plastic production and making sure the rest is safely collected and recycled,\u201d he said.Brendan Cooper, a consultant at Resource Futures, said they used the Rentschler flood-risk study as a starting point. \u201cWe then broke that down to those more in line with plastic-aggravated flooding,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cWe found urban areas have high levels of mismanaged waste.\u201dWhile the figures were estimated, he said, they were a \u201cconservative\u201d estimate.Densely populated slums in south Asia, east Asia and Pacific and sub-Saharan Africa were likely to be experiencing the worst effects of plastic-aggravated flooding due to rapid, poorly planned development, with limited flood-mitigation infrastructure, the report found.Developing country voices will be excluded at UN plastic talks, say NGOsRead moreIt showed that plastic pollution in slums in many low and middle-income countries was making flooding more severe by blocking drainage systems, resulting in health problems, including gastrointestinal diseases such as cholera and diarrhoeal disease.The researchers excluded coastal communities and small-island developing states from the research, as coastal flooding is unlikely to be aggravated by plastic waste.More than 1 billion people live in slums globally, and this is expected to reach 3 billion by 2050. The most commonly observed plastic items blocking drainage systems, the report found, were bottles, nylon threads from the fishing industry, plastic bags and sachets.The study said the accumulation of plastic pollution could cause the water level to rise by one metre within the first hour of a flood.",

After years of legal challenges and opposition from environmentalists, the US supreme court made a ruling in July to allow construction to resume on the $6.6bn pipeline, which has been championed by Senator Joe Manchin.According to Scientist Rebellion, a coalition of scientists who are actively protesting against climate change, over two dozen work stoppages such as lockdowns, rallies and walk-ons have taken place at the Mountain Valley pipeline construction site in the past two months. On Tuesday, two protesters who attached themselves to construction vehicles were arrested and charged with trespassing, obstruction of justice and interfering with property rights.++BREAKING++Dr Rose Abramoff @ultracricket of @ScientistRebel1 & activists from @stopthemvp & Rocking Chair Rebellion are blocking the Mountain Valley Pipeline drill in West Virginia US.

Abramoff said that while she was chained to the drill, the police were threatening the activists with felonies and domestic terrorism charges.All six activists were released later on Thursday and charged with critical infrastructure misdemeanors.Abramoff has a long history of climate activism. Last year, she chained herself to the White House fence to bring awareness to the climate crisis, and later marched with a group of activists down a major freeway in Washington DC, stalling traffic during rush hour. In November, she chained herself to the entrance of a private jet terminal in North Carolina.She also has already experienced the consequences of radical activism. In December of last year, Abramoff interrupted the American Geophysical Union meeting, calling on fellow scientists to join her in climate activism. In response, she was expelled from the conference and lost her job. \u201cI\u2019m all for decorum, but not when it will cost us the earth,\u201d she wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times. \u201cI used to be a well-behaved scientist.

Ministers are to consult on the future homes standard from next month, and it will take effect from 2025.Juliet Phillips, of the E3G thinktank, who organised the letter, said: \u201cConnecting new built homes to the gas grid, during a gas crisis, is a disaster for energy bills, energy security, and the climate emergency. Experts have repeatedly concluded that hydrogen will not provide a nationwide solution for heat decarbonisation.\u201dShe said: \u201cHydrogen-ready boilers could act as a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, allowing new homes to be connected to the gas grid, with little chance they will be supplied with green hydrogen anytime soon. We encourage the government to instead firmly double down on readily available clean tech solutions such as heat pumps.\u201dThe letter calls on ministers to ensure there are no new connections allowed to the gas grid, under the future homes standard. It notes that heat pumps are an established technology, along with low-carbon heat networks that use a central source such as geothermal heat.\u201cThere is a risk that allowing hydrogen-ready boilers to be installed could create a loophole which would allow new homes to be connected to the gas grid and burn fossil fuels for years to come,\u201d the signatories write. \u201c100% hydrogen for heating is not yet a tried and tested technology, and unlikely to be available for decades, and even then unlikely to be economic as a nationwide solution for domestic heat decarbonisation.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We encourage the UK government to take a strategic approach to the development and deployment of hydrogen, focusing on the sectors where it presents the most effective pathway to net zero.\u201dAbout 14% of the UK\u2019s emissions come from home heating, but there have been few initiatives to reduce this. Insulation and switching people from gas boilers to heat pumps are regarded as the most effective means of reducing emissions, but central government currently has no scheme offering incentives for insulation to most households, and the boiler upgrade scheme for heat pumps has been undersubscribed.",

Puffins were close to extinction, with just 13 counted on the windswept 450-hectare island in 2001.Seabirds treble on Lundy after island is declared rat-freeRead moreBut a drive to remove rats from the island has helped numbers to rebound. Black and brown rats, which arrived on Lundy as stowaways on ships over many decades, had been preying on the eggs and chicks, particularly those of burrow-nesting shearwaters and puffins.The rats were eradicated in a partnership led by the RSPB, Natural England, the Landmark Trust and the National Trust between 2002 and 2004 \u2013 a move that was opposed at the time by some animal rights groups, who argued that conservationists were favouring tourist-friendly birds over the rats.Since the island was declared rat-free in 2006, its seabird populations have bounced back, as they have on other small islands when invasive predators let loose by humans have been removed.Paul St Pierre, a conservation officer for the RSPB, said: \u201cPartnership projects like this show just how much potential there is to restore species and landscapes on an incredible scale.\u201cIf we can restore over 30,000 birds to one small island in the Bristol Channel, just imagine how much could be achieved if everyone came together to restore nature right across the UK.\u201dManx shearwaters taking off near Lundy.

But more southerly summer populations of seabirds that feed in the waters off south Wales and south-west England have largely bucked this downward trend.Derek Green, the general manager of Lundy, said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted by the dramatic increase of seabirds on Lundy in recent years. Conservation is at the heart of everything we do on the island and we look forward to continuing to nurture this very special place for future generations to enjoy.\u201dBritish coasts are internationally important for many species including puffins, grey seals and Manx shearwaters, with more than 80% of the world\u2019s population nesting in the country.The revival recalls the abundance of the 1930s: in 1939 it was estimated that Lundy was home to 80,000 seabirds.",

In a ruling handed down on Monday, Lady Justice Carr, leading a panel of three appeal court judges, disagreed.\u201cThis protest was of a wholly different nature and scale to the many non-violent protests of conscientious activists up and down the country exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly on a daily basis,\u201d Carr said.Carr admitted the sentences were severe. \u201cBut we have concluded that they were not manifestly excessive; nor did they amount to a disproportionate interference with their rights of freedom of expression and assembly.\u201d\u201cThis was very serious offending by repeat protest offenders who were trespassers (and on bail) at the time; whilst the protest was non-violent as such, it had extreme consequences for many, many members of the public.\u201dShe said the sentences met the \u201clegitimate\u201d aim of deterring others from such offending.At a hearing last Wednesday, Daniel Friedman KC, representing Trowland and Decker, had said their jail terms were \u201cthe longest ever handed down in a case of non-violent protest in this country in modern times\u201d.He told the court they had spent nine months in jail since their arrest last October, which amounted to the \u201clongest sentence ever served in living memory\u201d for someone convicted over a \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d. The sentences were, Friedman had argued, a \u201cdisproportionate interference\u201d with the activists\u2019 rights to free speech and protest, and were likely to have \u201ca chilling effect\u201d on all protest.Tom Little KC, for the Crown Prosecution Service, had opposed the two men\u2019s appeal bids, saying there would \u201cbe cases in which it is necessary to deter people from offending and further law-breaking\u201d.At their trial in April, Trowland, a structural engineer from Islington, north London, and Decker, a private tutor, of no fixed address, had denied causing a public nuisance, arguing it was a protest.They were found guilty by a jury who heard how drivers had missed funerals, hospital appointments and shifts at work, and businesses lost thousands of pounds in revenue, after police shut the bridge from 4am on 17 October until 9pm the next day.\u201cYou have to be punished both for the chaos you caused and to deter others from seeking to copy you in the next protest,\u201d said judge Shane Collery KC, as he passed sentence.Just Stop Oil has said Decker, a German citizen, faces deportation after serving his sentence.",

        "text": "In early 2022, journalists began to ask us how Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was affecting the climate crisis. While we could point to landscape fires, burning oil refineries and the thirst of diesel-hungry military vehicles, the emissions data they sought just wasn\u2019t available. When it came to the reverberating consequences of Russia\u2019s manipulation of Europe\u2019s fossil fuel insecurity, or to the weakening of the international cooperation necessary for coordinated global climate action, our guesses were no better than theirs.Two decades of international analysis and debate over the relationship between climate change and security has focused on how our rapidly destabilising climate could undermine the security of states. But it has largely ignored how national security choices, such as military spending or warfighting, can have an impact on the climate, and so undermine our collective security.With climate breakdown under way and accelerating, it is imperative that we are able to understand and minimise the emissions from all societal activities, whether in peacetime or at war. But when it comes to military or conflict emissions, this remains a distant goal.Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has seen the first attempt to comprehensively document the emissions from any conflict, and researchers have had to develop their methodologies from scratch. Their latest estimate puts the total as equivalent to the annual emissions of a country like Belgium. Ukraine is not a one-off, with a similar clamour for emissions data around Israel\u2019s war against Hamas. While the devastating ongoing conflicts in Sudan or Myanmar are yet to see attention on their emissions, the trend is clear: the carbon cost of conflict needs to be understood, just as the humanitarian, economic or wider environmental costs do.Russia and Israel lead global surge in attacks on civilian water suppliesRead moreA proportion of those carbon costs come from military activities. For these, understanding is hampered by the longstanding culture of domestic environmental exceptionalism enjoyed by militaries, and how at the US\u2019s insistence, this was translated into UN climate agreements. An exclusion to the 1997 Kyoto protocol became voluntary reporting under the 2015 Paris agreement. But when we began to collate and publish the emissions data that militaries report to the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), we found that only a handful of countries publish even the bare minimum required by UN reporting guidelines. Many countries with large militaries publish nothing at all.The best estimate we have is that militaries are responsible for 5.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. If the global military were a country, this would place it fourth in terms of its emissions, between India and Russia. Militaries are highly fossil fuel dependent and, while net zero targets have opened up debates around military decarbonisation, effective decarbonisation is impossible without understanding the scale of emissions, and without the domestic and international policy frameworks to encourage it. At present, we have neither, while carbon-intensive global military spending has reached record levels.Ultimately, the international policy framework means the UNFCCC. While some militaries have set vague emissions reduction goals, they are often short on scope and detail, and on accountability. For example, while Nato has drafted a methodology for counting emissions, it does not apply to its members, and it explicitly excludes emissions from Nato-led operations and missions, training and exercises.Amplified by the ongoing destruction of Gaza, Cop28 saw unprecedented attention on the relationship between the climate crisis, peace and security. But while visible in side events and protests, military and conflict emissions were again absent from the formal agenda. Closing this military and conflict emissions gap will first require that governments acknowledge the outsize role that militaries play in global emissions, and the need for greater transparency. It will require that the climate movement build on the growing trend towards intersectionality in its advocacy, and not shy away from these subjects. And it will depend on expanding the community of researchers documenting military and conflict emissions, and on their data being used by organisations tracking and reporting on global emissions trends.For decades military environmental exceptionalism and narrow interpretations of climate security have undermined our collective climate security, this has got to change.Doug Weir is the director of the Conflict and Environment Observatory, a UK charity that studies the environmental dimensions of armed conflicts and military activities. Its Military Emissions Gap project is a collaboration between academic and NGO partners and aims to improve implementation of the Paris agreement through greater military emissions reporting.",

But a study has found recycling itself could be releasing huge quantities of microplastics.An international team of scientists sampled wastewater from a state-of-the-art recycling plant at an undisclosed location in the UK. They found that the microplastics released in the water amounted to 13% of the plastic processed.The facility could be releasing up to 75bn plastic particles in each cubic metre of wastewater, they estimated.\u201cI was incredibly shocked,\u201d said Erina Brown, the lead researcher of the study, conducted at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. \u201cIt\u2019s scary because recycling has been designed in order to reduce the problem and to protect the environment. This is a huge problem we\u2019re creating.\u201dThe researchers tested the water before and after the plant installed a water filtration system and found the filter reduced the concentration of microplastics from 13% of the plastic processed to 6%.The estimate of 75bn particles a cubic metre is for a plant with a filter installed. A majority of the particles were smaller than 10 microns, about the diameter of a human red blood cell, with more than 80% smaller than five microns, Brown said.Microplastics, usually considered to be any particle of plastic measuring less than 5mm, have been found everywhere from freshly fallen snow in Antarctica to the depths of the ocean, and can be toxic for animals and plants.The results also revealed high levels of microplastics in the air around the recycling facility, with 61% of the particles less than 10 microns in size. Particulate matter less than 10 microns has been linked to human illness.The facility was a \u201cbest case scenario\u201d, Brown said, given that it had made efforts to install water filtration while many other recycling plants may not.\u201cAn important consideration is what other plants globally are emitting,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is something we really need to find out.\u201dThe study, published in the Journal of Hazardous Material Advances, suggests the recycling plant discharged up to 2,933 metric tonnes of microplastics a year before the filtration system was introduced, and up to 1,366 metric tonnes afterwards.\u201cMore than 90% of the particles we found were under 10 microns and 80% were under 5 microns,\u201d said Brown. \u201cThese are digestible by so many different organisms and found to be ingested by humans.\u201d\u201cFor me, it highlights how drastically we need to reduce our plastic consumption and production.\u201dGlobally, only about 9% of the 370m metric tonnes of plastic produced gets recycled.Judith Enck, a former senior official at the US Environmental Protection Agency, who now leads Beyond Plastics, a lobby group, said: \u201cThe findings are disturbing but not surprising. This one recycling facility, a state-of-the-art facility, demonstrates the serious problem of using plastics. It causes serious problems, even in terms of the infrastructure to recycle plastics.

        "text": "The leakage rate from Thames Water pipes is the highest for five years and the company will not meet its target to plug them this year, according to information released under freedom of information laws.The company, which serves 15 million customers across London and Thames Valley, has to have regular meetings with an environment minister because it is considered to be lagging in its performance.Details of letters released under freedom of information laws between the chief executive, Sarah Bentley, and Rebecca Pow, an environment minister, reveal that Thames is not fixing its leaks as it has promised.Bentley told Pow: \u201cRight now, we have the highest leakage rate since 2018. Consequently, we have already signalled to Ofwat that we are behind on our 2022/23 leakage performance and our target this year will now be very challenging to achieve.\u201cAs annual leakage targets are based on a three-year rolling average, the impact of this year will be felt, not just this year but for the next two years\u2019 performance.\u201dThames is proposing controversial measures to tackle drought in the future, including a \u201crecycling\u201d scheme in which up to 100m litres of treated sewage from the Mogden sewage works will be pumped into the River Thames at Teddington, south-west London, every day. This will replace 100m litres abstracted from the Thames to tackle water shortages.The project raises environmental concerns including increased water temperatures and a change in the salinity of the river, which will affect fish and biodiversity.It also involves digging three to four 10.5-metre shafts within a protected nature reserve, Ham Lands, a site of importance for nature conservation (SINC), according to Thames documents.The company is also proposing to transport 155m litres of water a day from Wales, in another sensitive policy to try to tackle water shortages in London and the south-east.But its failure to fix its own leaks \u2013 which are estimated to be 630m litres a day \u2013 is likely to make it more difficult for Thames to get approval for these proposals in its draft water resources management plan.Bentley blamed the hot, dry weather last summer, followed by a wet winter, for exacerbating leaks from the network and from customers\u2019 homes.\u201cThe hot and dry summer created an unprecedented \u2018soil moisture deficit\u2019, with ground drying out and causing leaks in our pipes and customers\u2019 pipes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt also led to large increases in demand from our customers [in some areas and at sometimes up to 50% more during the summer]. This drove up \u2018unmeasured consumption\u2019 and the need for us to pump more water through our pipes at higher pressure to satisfy demand that in turn also led to more leaks from our pipes.\u201cThe re-wetting of the ground later in the autumn then caused further movement and more leaks in our pipes and customers\u2019 pipes. More recently, the freezing temperatures before Christmas, followed by a speedy thaw, has resulted in a new surge of leaks \u2013 both on our water supply network and on our customer\u2019s pipes.\u201dThames, like other water companies, has a target to cut its leaks by 50% by 2050. But the Environment Agency has called for the company to increase this target. The EA says the company needs to do more to tackle leaks before suggesting schemes including the Teddington water recycling plan and the transport of water from Wales.It has said the security of water supply to the south-east and London will be at risk if the company does not tackle its leaks and reduce customer demand for water.Bentley told Pow in her letter dated January this year that Thames was running a \u00a31m communications campaign to highlight the challenges \u201cwe all face\u201d and educate customers on what they can do to help make sure there is enough water for everyone.The government has set a target of reducing individual daily water use from about 144 litres a day to 110 litres a day by 2050.On its website, Thames Water admits it is not acceptable that so much water is being lost. It said it is doing all that is reasonably practical to reduce leakage but it will miss its 22/23 target, and that will affect future years. However, the company is working to improve its \u201cleakage transformation plan\u201d.A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cWe have been very clear to water companies that we expect them to deliver on their commitments \u2013 including targets to reduce leakage by 30% by 2032.\u201cThe government is taking a number of actions to improve water supply through our Plan for Water, as well as taking action to clean up our water through more investment, stronger regulation and tougher enforcement.\u201d This article was amended on 22 June 2023 to clarify that the 100m litres of treated sewage from the Mogden sewage works that would be pumped into the River Thames would be every day.",

Many governments in Africa lack the capabilities to record climate impacts. The scientists behind the report said this lack of information made implementing measures to avoid deaths very difficult.The study linking the prolonged heatwave to the climate crisis was the first in sub-Saharan Africa and found temperatures were 2.5C higher than the recent average. Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar and home to more than 3 million people, suffered some of the most unusual heat. If continued fossil-fuel burning pushes global temperature up to 2C above pre-industrial levels, this intensity of heatwave would be expected every five years, the researchers calculated.Hundreds of climate studies have now shown that human-caused global heating is making extreme weather more frequent and more intense across the world. Heatwaves alone are likely to have caused millions of unreported early deaths over the last three decades.Funding from wealthy countries to help the developing world cope with climate impacts will be a key topic at the UN Cop28 climate summit that begins on 30 November.Dr Rondrotiana Barimalala, an oceanographer from Madagascar now at the Norwegian Research Centre in Bergen, said: \u201cMadagascar is already being impacted by climate change, making life harder for millions of people. It is critical communities and governments take steps to become more resilient.\u201dMore than 90% of the country\u2019s residents live in poverty, half do not have access to clean water or electricity, and many live in informal housing, making it hard to deal with extreme heat.Dr Izidine Pinto, a climatologist at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, said: \u201cAfrica is notorious for the underreporting of heat impacts. Many countries experiencing poverty just don\u2019t have the means to manage extreme heat.\u201dSayanti Sengupta of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre said: \u201cJust because it\u2019s not reported does not mean it\u2019s not impacting \u2013 it is for sure.\u201d She added that night-time temperatures had made it hard for children to breathe during the heatwave, according to anecdotal reports.Global temperature records have been shattered in 2023, and leading climate scientists told the Guardian in August that the \u201ccrazy\u201d extreme weather was just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d compared with the even worse impacts to come.The new study was conducted by the World Weather Attribution group. The researchers used weather data and climate models to see how the intensity and frequency of heatwaves in Madagascar today compared with those before global heating pushed up the planet\u2019s temperature.Dr Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said: \u201cClimate change is a problem created and made worse by the richest countries and companies, but the poorest are suffering the most. At Cop28, we need commitments from developed countries to deliver finance to the loss and damage fund.\u201d",

I\u2019ve based the recipe on the classic German blueberry kuchen, which feature a cake base moistened with fresh berries, all covered in a crunchy, crumble-style topping. I\u2019ve boosted the flavour and fortified the mix by using whole spelt and rye flours with rapadura sugar, though regular wheat flour and brown sugar will work as nicely, so use whatever flour, sugar, nuts and spices you have to hand. As for the fruit content, even just a small handful of over-ripe berries will do.Berry streusel muffinsThese muffins make a great use of past-their-best berries, by upcycling squishy fruit into a crowdpleasing cake. They also work well using frozen berries and other ripe fruit, including diced pear, kiwi, banana, pineapple and peach. Unlike the traditional blueberry kuchen, I\u2019ve pared down the recipe so it works using just a small amount of fruit.

Photograph: MSDS MarineOther wrecks are the Iona II, a paddle steamer which started life as a ferry on the Clyde and was in 1864 on its way to America to be used as a Confederate blockade-runner during the American civil war. It foundered east of Lundy during foggy weather.The Klein Hollandia, one of the protected wreck sites named as getting new protection, was only definitively identified earlier this year, previously referred to as the \u201cUnknown Wreck off Eastbourne\u201d.It was built in 1654 and was involved in all major battles in the second Anglo-Dutch war . It was captured by the English during an attack on the Dutch Smyrna convoy in 1672 but was too damaged to avoid sinking.The wreck has many stories to tell but any thefts or amateur investigation could cause irreparable damage, said Meara.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the artefact you lose, it is all that potential for knowledge and learning and education. When things are taken there is also a potential side-effect of causing additional damage to things like a wooden hull structure.\u201dThe new technology had been eight years in the making, Historic England said.It is similar to the forensic marking that might be used on church roof lead which has, over the years, been systematically targeted by gangs for its scrap value. The big difference is that it has to be applied under water by divers.The announcement is being made in what is the 50th anniversary year of the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973.As well as the 57 sites with the highest protection, there are about 6,000 wreck sites which experts know the location of, and then more than 30,000 others that haven\u2019t been found. \u201cBut we know they are out there,\u201d said Meara.There is a romance which comes with shipwrecks. \u201cIt is a cliche but it\u2019s true, they are time capsules and because we know where they\u2019ve come from, we know the exact day they were lost, there is so much they can tell us,\u201d said Meara.\u201cThe stories are endless. You\u2019ve got international trade, relations between nations, fascinating insights into different kinds of technology and how ships were built and repaired and modified. And then there are the personal stories when you find objects which belonged to individuals.\u201dAlison James, the heritage and systems manager at the specialist archaeological contractor MSDS Marine, said the protective marking project \u201cis a gamechanger for maritime archaeology and how authorities protect sites underwater\u201d.

        "text": "When the mill owner Joseph Strutt cut the ribbon on the Derby Arboretum in 1840, entry came with a caveat. This landscaped sweep, one of the first public parks in England, was only open to the public on Sundays and Wednesdays. For the rest of the week, its fountains and pathways were reserved for paying customers, whose entry fees effectively subsidised the park.The system was scrapped in 1882, as the growing concern for public health among Victorian reformers accelerated the creation of open public parks in towns and cities across England. Anyone can now stroll through Derby\u2019s arboretum. But another form of gatekeeping is taking place in parks today. Councils that have seen their budgets eviscerated by austerity are finding ways to turn parks into cash-generating assets, often by renting stretches of the land to fenced-off commercial events.These deals can be mutually beneficial, particularly when the park is sizable and locals are consulted. They can also resemble a destructive form of temporary privatisation. Earlier this month, Haringey council in north London rented part of Finsbury Park to Tough Mudder, a popular obstacle course and run for adults. Initiatives that encourage outdoor exercise are welcome, but the scale and nature of the event drew criticism after hundreds of racers churned up mud and trampled a community orchard. The company has apologised and Tough Mudder will not return to the park. The council should have foreseen the damage. After visiting the scene, the local MP David Lammy called it an \u201cenvironmental disgrace\u201d.Races and festivals generate income that councils can reinvest in park maintenance, but they can also wall off areas of parkland, making them less accessible for locals. As one resident wrote in the Guardian, other events held in Finsbury Park have required 37 industrial-sized generators and a three-metre high fence. This reliance on commercial income isn\u2019t limited to London. Residents in Swansea and Manchester have complained about frequent fenced-off events. Councils find themselves in a difficult position. Parks are a discretionary service, and so they are vulnerable to cost-cutting. Local authority funding has shrunk by \u00a315bn in real terms since 2010. Income from events has become an increasingly important source of revenue.This reliance on commercial cash may seem like an unimportant nuance. But it represents a profound change in the funding of municipal infrastructure, following David Cameron\u2019s ambition to build a \u201cleaner\u201d state. Although some councils can plug funding gaps by renting space commercially, not all have this ability. A 2022 Guardian investigation found that councils in deprived areas \u2013 where people are often less likely to have access to green spaces \u2013 had cut spending on parks by as much as 92% since 2010. Knowsley council planned to sell off 10% of its parks until protests led to a U-turn. Newcastle city council has handed over its parks to a charitable trust, leaving their maintenance in the hands of volunteers.There are examples that buck this trend: Liverpool city council recently signed a legally binding agreement to protect its parks in perpetuity. But for councils that cannot make their parks pay, the risk is a thinning of municipal infrastructure and a crumbling public realm. Many civic spaces have already been privatised or sold off. Parks are one of the last areas of truly public space. They offer us solace and fresh air, space to breathe and exercise. Councils should not have to depend on commercial revenue to safeguard their future.",

By linking two existing dams, the aim would be to pump water to the higher reservoir during periods of cheap electricity and release it through hydro plants when power prices are high.Snowy is also facing delays on its other major project, the 660MW Hunter power project at Kurri Kurri, near Newcastle.Senators asked about the timing of the $600m-plus project and also, as the company states on its website, if it will be \u201ccapable of running initially on up to 10% hydrogen and with some minor additional investment \u2026 capable of up to 30%\u201d when operational.Barnes dismissed a question by NSW Nationals senator Ross Cadell that the ultimate cost could blow out to as much as $1.5bn.\u201cIt won\u2019t be anywhere near that,\u201d Barnes said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now research suggests that\u2019s no fiction, with scientists identifying two aspects of their personality.Experts say that just as five dimensions of personality, including openness and neuroticism, are often used to describe humans \u2013 with everyone sitting somewhere on a scale for each trait \u2013 Siberian tigers all sit on two scales dubbed \u201cmajesty\u201d and \u201csteadiness\u201d.\u201cIf I were to choose which of these human dimensions resemble our tiger dimensions most, I would probably compare majesty to extraversion and steadiness to the opposite of neuroticism,\u201d said Dr Abdel Abdellaoui, joint first author of the research from the University of Amsterdam.Dr Rosalind Arden, joint-first author of the research from the London School of Economics, said that while the two scales do not offer a complete description of tigers\u2019 personalities, they do capture some differences. \u201cIt shows that [tigers] do tend to have some dispositions, just as in humans you get people who are very extrovert or very introvert,\u201d she said.Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science, the team describe how Chinese researchers involved in the study drew up a list of about 70 words that experts working with tigers deemed appropriate to describe the animals\u2019 temperaments, such as adaptive, obstinate, stupid and frank.\u201cThese were all initially Chinese words, so there might be both cultural and language differences that make some of these words harder to translate,\u201d noted Abdellaoui.A tiger personality questionnaire based on the words was then given to feeders or veterinarians that worked closely with 152 tigers in the Harbin Siberian tiger park and those who worked with 96 tigers living in Hengdaohezi Siberian tiger park, both in China. Each tiger was rated, on average, by more than three people.The results from Harbin Siberian tiger park revealed the words formed two main clusters when applied to the big cats, with these clusters replicated in the second group of tigers.The researchers dubbed these clusters \u201cmajesty\u201d and \u201csteadiness\u201d. A high score for the former encompassed high ratings for words such as dignified, imposing and agile but low ratings on words like withdrawn or feeble. A high \u201csteadiness\u201d score was associated with high ratings on words like loving, obedient and quiet, but low ratings for words such as aggressive or cruel.Taken together, \u201cmajesty\u201d and \u201csteadiness\u201d accounted for 38% of the differences between tigers\u2019 personality questionnaire scores.Further analysis revealed tigers that scored highly for \u201cmajesty\u201d were healthier, preyed more on live animals, ate more, mated more and ranked higher on group status.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The people most likely had food stores that would get them through a single year of drought. But when hit with three consecutive years, there was no food to sustain them,\u201d Brita Lorentzen, a University of Georgia anthropology professor and study co-author, said.\u201cThis would have led to a collapse of the tax base, mass desertion of the large Hittite military and likely a mass movement of people seeking survival. The Hittites were also challenged by not having a port or other easy avenues to move food into the area,\u201d Lorentzen added.Indo-European languages originated from HittitesRead moreThe Hittites, with their capital Hattusa situated in central Anatolia, were one of the ancient world\u2019s great powers across five centuries. They became the main geopolitical rivals of ancient Egypt during its glittering New Kingdom period.\u201cIn pre-modern times, with none of our infrastructure and technology, the Hittites controlled and ruled a huge region for centuries despite myriad challenges of space, threats from neighbors and entities incorporated into their empire, and despite being centered in a semi-arid region,\u201d said Cornell University professor of arts and sciences in classics Sturt Manning, lead author of the research published in the journal Nature.Scholars long have pondered what triggered the fall of the Hittites and broader collapse that also devastated kingdoms in Greece, Crete and the Middle East while weakening the Egyptians. Hypotheses have included war, invasion and climate change. The new study offers some clarity about the Hittites.The researchers examined long-lived juniper trees that grew in the region at the time and eventually were harvested to build a wooden structure south-west of Ankara around 748 BC that may have been the burial chamber for a relative of Phrygia\u2019s King Midas, who legend holds turned anything he touched into gold.The trees offered a regional paleoclimatic record in two ways: patterns of annual tree-ring growth, with narrow rings indicating dry conditions; and the ratio of two forms, or isotopes, of carbon in the rings, revealing the tree\u2019s response to water availability.What the collapse of ancient capitals can teach us about the cities of todayRead moreThey detected a gradual shift to drier conditions from the 13th century BC into the 12th century BC. More importantly, both lines of evidence indicated three straight years of severe drought, in 1198, 1197 and 1196 BC, coinciding with the known timing of the empire\u2019s dissolution.Hattusa, enclosed by a monumental stone wall with gates adorned with lions and sphinxes, was burned and abandoned. Texts written on clay tablets using the cuneiform script common in the region \u2013 detailing Hittite society, politics, religion, economics and foreign affairs \u2013 went silent.\u201cI think this study really shows the lessons we can learn from history. The climate changes that are likely to occur for us in the next century will be much more severe than those the Hittites experienced,\u201d Cornell professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and study co-author Jed Sparks said. \u201cAnd it begs the questions: what is our resilience? How much can we withstand?\u201d",

The combined figured surpassed the \u00a3179.8m spent on upgrading infrastructure \u2013 from replacing pipes to improving water supplies \u2013 from 2020 to 2022, the Financial Times reported.David Hall, a visiting professor at Greenwich University, told the FT that the potential for shortages in south-east England had been \u201cknown about for a long time but had not been dealt with due to bad planning, a failure to cut leakage and a decision to divert money towards dividends rather than investing in infrastructure\u201d.South East Water, which has 2.2 million customers, said it is \u201cprioritising projects across its system to increase the amount of water that we can supply\u201d and that it had invested nearly \u00a3500m in its network over the past five years. It said no dividends had reached its ultimate parent company, HDF (UK) Holdings and it does not expect to pay a dividend this year or next.Of the \u00a3156m in dividends, \u00a3136m was through a regulator-approved payout used to pay off an internal loan to its parent company in 2020 and the remainder was used to pay interest on debts within the group. South East Water is ultimately owned by a consortium comprising Australian and Canadian funds and NatWest\u2019s pension fund.Water companies\u2019 finances are under intense public and political scrutiny after it emerged that officials were drawing up contingency plans for the UK\u2019s largest supplier, Thames Water, in case it needed to be temporarily nationalised.The company, which serves 15 million customers, is struggling under a \u00a316bn debt mountain as rising interest rates have pushed up borrowing costs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "The disappearance of reliable seasonal patterns is causing chaos for the flora and fauna of the UK, a long-running annual audit of the impact of weather on nature has found.Extreme weather events, from storms and pounding rain to searing heat and drought are putting huge pressure on animals, plants and the environment, the report from the National Trust says.The conservation charity is urging politicians to prioritise \u201curgent action\u201d to protect nature and people from future climate shocks and says parties should commit to making changes in their manifestos for the next UK general election.Ben McCarthy, the head of nature and restoration ecology at the National Trust, said: \u201cThe shifting weather patterns we\u2019re seeing, particularly the warmer temperatures, is continuing to upset the natural, regular rhythm of the seasons. This loss of predictability causes chaos for the behaviours of animals in particular, but can also impact trees and plants.\u201dThe National Trust gave a long list of species that have suffered in the last 12 months, including oak trees, which are increasingly vulnerable to the oak processionary moth, whose caterpillars infest them. The lack of prolonged cold snaps in recent years means the moths have spread northwards from their traditional home in the Mediterranean.Another troublemaker doing well is the heather beetle, which is killing off swathes of the heathland plant in some areas. A drone survey of Dunwich Heath in Suffolk revealed a 60% loss in heather.The warmer winters means hibernators such as dormice are emerging from their torpor too early and using up vital energy stores. It is also leading to red deer rutting later, meaning calves are born in the summer rather than the spring, with insufficient time to grow and put on fat reserves to survive.According to the trust, some of the rare lichens and liverworts that grow in the temperate rainforest at Lydford Gorge, on the edge of Dartmoor in Devon perished because of the lack of water last winter.But then water voles were driven from flooded burrows when the torrential rains have come in, putting them at increased risk of cold, hunger and predation.McCarthy, said: \u201cThese baseline changes that we\u2019re seeing are really worrying and what we should be taking more notice of, particularly when combined with extreme weather events, which makes things even more challenging.The autumn storms, Babet and Ciaran, caused havoc, knocking down trees including a 260-year old Cedar of Lebanon at Charlecote Park in Warwickshire and eroding river banks and beaches.One of the consequences of the storm just coming to light is the possible impact on the population of the shags, the seabirds that look similar to cormorants that live and breed on the Farne Islands in Northumberland. There are hardly any birds in the winter roosts on the islands, with a number of dead birds being washed up on the islands. It is thought Babet disrupted their ability to feed and led to starvation.There were scraps of bright news. Record-breaking numbers \u2013 at least for recent years \u2013 of choughs were spotted in Cornwall with a 60% increase in the number of chicks on 2022. The elegant crow is a symbol of Cornwall but became extinct and is back on the rise.At Formby in Merseyside, rangers recorded the first emergence of natterjack toadlets since 2020 in May with approximately 150 counted across the site.The rare black oil beetle was spotted at Kinver Edge in Staffordshire for the first time in nine years. The sandy soil there suits burrowing insects such as solitary bees, whose nests and eggs the oil beetle feeds on.Persistent rain in July and the warm, wet conditions that continued into the autumn were ideal for waxcap grassland fungi. One, the dark velvet fanvault was found at Hardcastle Crags in West Yorkshire, the first record of it in the UK.Butterflies and moths on the whole seem to have had a better year than expected, considering last year\u2019s drought. Staff noted record-breaking numbers of the Heath fritillary butterfly on the Holnicote Estate on Exmoor in Somerset.But the charity\u2019s audit, which it has been carrying out for 15 years, makes gloomy reading overall.\u201cWe need to see more action from politicians, particularly as we enter this election year, to ensure tackling the nature and climate crisis is a top priority,\u201d said McCarthy.\u201cWe want to see parties commit to accelerating progress on nature restoration, increase support for nature-based solutions to climate change and to put climate adaptation at the heart of their manifestos, so the UK can be better prepared for the weather extremes we will increasingly experience.\u201d",

I like my tortilla runny in the middle, but if you prefer it more cooked through, give it about six minutes on each side, rather than just three or four. And take care not to spill hot oil on you when flipping the tortilla. If you\u2019d rather not risk the flip, finish it off under the grill or in a hot oven; if you go down that route, however, leave the tortilla soft-set before its final blast, to ensure the best results and texture.Serves 4-6Light olive oil, for frying2 onions, peeled and sliced2 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped500g leftover roast potatoes, chopped into cubes6 eggs, lightly beatenSalt and black pepperLight olive oil, for fryingHeat a good drop of oil in a frying pan, then saute the onions for about 10 minutes, until soft. Add the garlic, fry for another two minutes, then take off the heat.Put the potatoes in a bowl, stir in the cooked onion mix and leave to cool. Once cool, stir in the beaten eggs, season andleave to rest for five minutes.Meanwhile, heat a good splash of oil in a small (16-18cm-diameter), deep frying pan. When the oil is very hot, pour in the egg mixture and swirl the pan from side to side to stop the egg sticking. Turn down the heat to very low and leave to cook for three or four minutes.Place a plate on top of the pan and flip out the tortilla on to it, taking care of the hot oil. Return the pan to the heat, add another splash of oil and, when that\u2019s hot, slide the tortilla uncooked side down back into the pan. Shake from side to side again, turn the heat down very low and, using a wooden spoon or spatula, tuck any rough edges underneath to make the tortilla neat and rounded. Cook for a further three or four minutes, then slide out on to a plate and eat warm (or leave to cool to room temperature and serve later).

It\u2019s that simple. If the government disagrees, it needs to provide evidence and prove it in court.\u201dThe field was given the green light in September and has the potential to produce 500m barrels of oil in its lifetime, which when burned would emit as much carbon dioxide as running 56 coal-fired power stations for a year.With Rosebank, Britain appears willing to leave climate plans in tatters Read moreThe project has faced stiff resistance, with hundreds of climate scientists and academics and more than 200 organisations, from the Women\u2019s Institute to Oxfam, joining tens of thousands of people across the UK in opposing it.It also flies in the face of warnings from scientists about the impact of the development on the climate, and repeated statements from the International Energy Agency that no new oil and gas exploration should take place if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.Greenpeace UK\u2019s co-executive director, Areeba Hamid, said: \u201cRosebank\u2019s development was approved under the false claim that it is entirely compatible with the UK\u2019s legally binding climate commitments. This is a lie.\u201cThe government used a rigged climate assessment to approve its development, deliberately ignoring all the emissions that will come from burning the 500m barrels of oil it contains. It\u2019s like building a bomb and claiming it\u2019s completely harmless so long as no one detonates it.\u201dCampaigners say the UK public will carry almost all the cost of developing the field, while Rosebank\u2019s owners are set to receive around \u00a33bn in tax breaks. And they claim the project will not cut household energy bills, as the oil sold on the world market would make no material difference to the price UK consumers pay.The Guardian view on the Rosebank oilfield: a symbol of Sunak\u2019s cynicism | EditorialRead moreA spokesperson for the government rejected the claims and said it would \u201crobustly defend\u201d the legal challenges.\u201cThe UK is a world leader in reaching net zero \u2013 cutting emissions faster than any other major economy \u2013 and, as the independent Climate Change Committee recognises, we will still need oil and gas as part of our energy mix.\u201cWe will continue to back the UK\u2019s oil and gas industry, which underpins our energy security, supports up to 200,000 jobs, and will provide around \u00a350bn in tax revenue over the next five years \u2013 helping fund our transition to net zero.\u201dIn a report in June, the Climate Change Committee said: \u201cThe UK will continue to need some oil and gas until it reaches net zero, but this does not in itself justify the development of new North Sea fields.\u201dGreenpeace and Uplift have both applied to the court of session in Edinburgh for a judicial review of the decision by the energy secretary, currently Claire Coutinho, and the North Sea Transition Authority.The court is expected to rule on whether or not to grant permission for a full hearing of the case early next year.",

The wetland-dwelling birds depend on reedbed habitats, where they move, camouflaged, to hunt fish, insects and amphibians.The males are easiest to count as you hear them before you see them; they are the loudest bird in the UK with their far-carrying \u201cfoghorn\u201d boom being detectable up to three miles away. Men of the species make this noise in spring to attract female mates.Bitterns returned to Norfolk, coming over from the European mainland, in 1900, but after their wetlands were drained for agriculture in the 20th century their population dropped again and fell to just 11 males by 1997.Since then, the restoration of their habitat has caused the species to recover, though it is still amber-listed, meaning it is under threat.Conservationists continue to try to restore their habitat so they can have a secure future in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Tens of millions under air quality alerts in US as Canada fire smoke drifts southRead moreNew York, Washington DC, Delaware and Pennsylvania had the worst air quality in the nation on Wednesday morning, EPA data showed. Levels in central New York were deemed \u201chazardous\u201d \u2013 the worst level on the EPA\u2019s index for air quality reporting \u2013 while Philadelphia was placed under a \u201ccode red\u201d as the air quality index soared to its highest level since 2008.Exposure to smoke can trigger an array of health problems, experts say, but there are ways residents can keep themselves safe.Staying inside and especially refraining from strenuous outdoor activity is an important way to limit exposure, said Laura Kate Bender, the national assistant vice-president of the healthy air program at the American Lung Association.If one must go outside, experts suggest wearing a mask \u2013 preferably an N95 or equivalent.Keeping indoor air clean by closing windows and doors is also helpful, as is turning on air purification devices when possible. (The Environmental Protection Agency does not certify air purifiers, but California regulators recommend these models.)Wildfire smoke is made up of a cocktail of irritants, including gaseous pollutants like carbon monoxide and hazardous air pollutants like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Most concerning, it can include pollution particles known as fine particulate matter or PM2.5, which are so tiny that they can enter the bloodstream when breathed in.The smoke can create an array of health problems, including shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing and eye irritation, especially for at-risk groups.People with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other respiratory issues are particularly vulnerable, as are children, who breathe in more air because their lungs are still developing.Pregnant people can have diminished lung capacities, making them more vulnerable to wildfire smoke as well. Exposure to air pollution has also been linked to gestational diabetes, preterm birth and even stillbirth.Other vulnerable groups include those with a \u201csignificant chronic disease\u201d, said Kimberly Humphrey, climate change and human health fellow at the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health.\u201cThings like diabetes, heart disease, and heart failure are all aggravated by poor air quality as well,\u201d she said.Meanwhile, while the west coast has seen a dramatic rise in wildfire smoke over the past decade, for eastern US residents, wildfire smoke can be especially dangerous due to a lack of awareness.\u201cIf you live somewhere where there are frequently wildfires, then people generally are aware of it being an issue and they know what to do,\u201d said Humphrey. \u201cBut where there haven\u2019t been significant wildfires or smoke before, we find people often don\u2019t know what to do.\u201dTo stay safe amid the pollution, residents in affected areas should remain aware of local air quality by keeping tabs on local weather and news alerts.Another helpful resource is the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s airnow.gov website, which rates air quality on a scale. Levels 0 to 50 are considered the healthiest, levels over 150 can trigger some symptoms, and levels over 200 are considered \u201cvery unhealthy\u201d.But the responsibility to say safe from wildfire smoke cannot only fall on individuals, said Humphrey. Policymakers must also take steps to protect communities.That\u2019s especially true for lower socioeconomic communities, she said, who may have less access to proper ventilation and effective masks, and may be more likely to work in outdoor settings.As the climate crisis, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, dries out once wet areas and sends temperatures soaring, wildfires are set to become a more common occurrence across the US.\u201cThe climate is changing, and we know that we will see impacts of wildfires of wildfire smoke where we never saw them before,\u201d said Humphrey. \u201cThe key is for our policymakers to really keep ahead of that and to do really adequate risk assessments now, before things get even worse.\u201d",

His headline speech to the Tory party conference spoke about the sense of responsibility that his party feels for the environment.But simultaneously he is arguing that his policies will end a (make-believe) war on motorists.And while cancelling the Manchester HS2 branch and building roads may feel like a lovely thing to do for a small group of drivers, it will potentially lead to all sorts of environmental problems elsewhere.Cancelling high-speed rail to build more roads is not just a betrayal of the promise to \u201clevel up\u201d the north, but also a weakening by stealth of net zero policies. Transport produced 24% of the UK\u2019s total emissions in 2020, and remains the largest emitting sector in the UK. Encouraging more traffic will only increase these emissions, and will make the country more unpleasant and polluted to live in.For a start, we already know that building more roads means more traffic \u2013 study after study has shown the way in which traffic grows to meet the available space, and five years after any road is built, traffic volume has increased and congestion is as it was originally.We also know it means more air pollution and less land for green spaces and housing.

He presumably knows by the time they come around, he will have long departed the world stage.The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, summed up the government\u2019s views on the environment by choosing to fly from London to Manchester on a flight that took half an hour. His team said initially he decided to fly because he had an important meeting with the Japanese ambassador on Sunday morning but he then told the BBC that he thought his train had been cancelled.Slow route to net zero will worsen global climate crisis, IPCC chief warnsRead moreEven Jacob Rees-Mogg believed the carbon-belching transport method to be a folly, telling the Guardian it does not save time because of the waiting times either side of the flight. Private aviation fan Sunak drove to Manchester, eschewing his beloved helicopter.The net zero secretary, Claire Coutinho,  said \u201cnet zero is a religion\u201d for Labour and accused Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, of being a \u201cradical\u201d.The home secretary, Suella Braverman, can always be relied on for a reactionary comment, and she used her speech to attack net zero as a \u201cluxury belief\u201d held by the wealthy elite \u2013 ignoring that it is the wealthy elite in the global north causing the majority of the emissions that are inflicting misery on poorer countries.The environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, praised Sunak\u2019s decision to roll back on net zero and told a lunch for the British Association for Shooting and Conservation she disagrees with the right to roam campaign \u2013 saying \u201cthe only things that have a right to roam are farmers, pigs and their cattle\u201d.Meanwhile, Michael Gove insists that a \u201cgreen Brexit has been delivered\u201d, citing farming reforms, the 25-year environment plan (which the Office for Environment Protection says he is now undermining) and Coffey\u2019s widely derided \u201cplan for water\u201d to reduce sewage spills.The atmosphere has been muted. Unlike under Liz Truss, where there were frenetic fights over fracking (though she did pop up again this year to inform us we need to frack to reach economic greatness), delegates seem to be aware that any idea this government puts forward will most likely be short-lived, as they are resigned to losing the general election next year.It is hard to fathom how politicians could turn such a crucial issue, our livable planet, into a misinformation-filled culture war waged in the hope of a less embarrassing election failure.

The children had tests to measure theeir breathing power at the ages of six, 10 and 15.The researchers compared the results with estimated levels of pollution in the areas the children had lived until they were one year old. After controlling for factors including parental smoking, the researchers found that the higher the level of pollution exposure as babies, the worse their lung function was as adolescents. The impact was even greater on children who developed asthma.A second study, also presented at the congress, found that adults who were exposed to air pollution, even at low levels, were more likely to develop asthma.In a study of 23,000 Danish nurses, the researchers found a 29% rise in asthma risk for each increase of 6.3 micrograms per cubic metre (\u00b5g/m3) in small particulate matter known as PM2.5. They also found a 16% rise in asthma risk for each 8.2 \u00b5g/m3 increase of nitrogen dioxide.The WHO limit for PM2.5 is an annual average of 10 \u00b5g/m3, and the EU limit is 25. Both the WHO and EU limits for nitrogen dioxide are 40 \u00b5g/m3.Shuo Liu, a visiting PhD fellow at the University of Copenhagen, told the conference: \u201cThe fact that we found a link with asthma, even at relatively low levels of exposure, suggests that there is no safe threshold for air pollution. This is strong evidence that our regulations on air pollution need to be stricter if we want to prevent cases of asthma.\u201dThierry Troosters, president of the European Respiratory Society, said: \u201cThese studies are concerning because they suggest that current regulations, such as the EU limit values for air pollution, are not safe enough. Previous research has shown that up to 67,000 cases of childhood asthma could be avoided every year in Europe if countries would meet the World Health Organization air quality limit values, which are lower than the EU\u2019s current standards.\u201dAir pollution may be \u2018key contributor\u2019 to Covid-19 deaths \u2013 studyRead moreCampaigners in the UK have called on the government to replace the existing EU air quality directive with more stringent legal limits. Zak Bond, a policy officer at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: \u201cWe are campaigning for the government to commit to a legal limit for PM2.5 in the environment bill in line with WHO guidelines. It\u2019s time to reduce air pollution so everyone can breathe clean air with healthy lungs.\u201dChris Large, the joint-CEO at the environmental charity Global Action Plan said: \u201cThis research makes it ever clearer that even low levels can have a horrendous impact throughout people\u2019s lives.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019d like the government to adopt WHO standards as a bare minimum and reallocate the \u00a327bn set aside for a new road-building programme towards initiatives such as improving broadband quality that reduce the need for road travel.\u201dThe clean air campaigner Rosamund Kissi-Debrah said: \u201cPeople are wrong to think everything is OK as long as pollution levels are within legal limits. There\u2019s no such thing as a safe level.\u201dJemima Hartshorn, the founder of Mums for Lungs, called on the government to \u201cstop dragging its feet and implement binding and enforceable WHO levels in law\u201d. \u201cWe cannot compromise on the nation\u2019s health,\u201d she said.",

It now accounts for 15% of lung cancers diagnosed and is responsible for around 6,000 deaths a year. Recent research at UCL and the Francis Crick Institute has found that exposure to fine particulate pollution, specifically PM 2.5, is linked to LCNS as well as the growth of other cancers.The ill-advised tax breaks on particulate emitting diesel vehicles earlier this century could well account for the UK\u2019s huge increase in LCNS, not to mention unknowable consequences for the future health of children exposed to toxic air.I was appalled to hear Chris Philp MP, on Any Questions on BBC Radio 4 last week, dismiss the positive impact of London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) when published data from Imperial College London shows that harmful emissions have reduced by 26% within the expanded Ulez area, and that the Ulez has reduced PM 2.5 levels by 41% since 2017.I am now facing an uncertain future and considering treatment options. Meanwhile, measures to reduce pollution in London are being politicised, and serious risks to the health of the capital\u2019s population pitted against election prospects (Starmer urges Khan to \u2018reflect\u2019 on Ulez rules after Uxbridge defeat, 22 July).Name and address supplied Rishi Sunak explains the narrow Tory byelection victory in Uxbridge and South Ruislip as the consequence of fighting on \u201ca matter of substance\u201d (Tory election victory hopes hit by shattering byelection defeats, 22 July).This \u201cmatter of substance\u201d involved measures to reduce air pollution, which causes the premature deaths of thousands of Londoners every year and worsens the lives of up to 500,000 asthma sufferers in the capital. The Tory candidate admits he focused on the concerns of local residents on how the Ulez may affect their ability to use their cars without paying the cost of the pollution they generate. In fact, 90% of the cars being driven in outer London would not be subject to Ulez payments.Dr Martin PricePoole, Dorset After the Conservative victory, tiny as it was, in Uxbridge, there is talk of political parties losing their nerve over green policies. Keir Starmer is saying that we must listen to voters. But the real problem is that no party, with the exception of the Greens, is being honest with the electorate about the consequences of climate change and biodiversity loss. Instead, they say the economy must come first. But this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between the economy and the environment.Party leaders often speak as if the environment is somehow a subset of the economy. But of course the economy is really a subset of the environment \u2013 there can be no economy without a healthy environment. This is what politicians need to be honest about. It\u2019s the environment, stupid.Prof Hugh DunkerleyBrighton With debates raging over Ulez, and over retention and pay within the NHS, I wonder whether a simple way to aid both these causes might be to review the age requirement to receive a Freedom Pass, which allows free travel, while offering the lower-paid in the NHS free travel within inner and outer London.Living close to hospitals is often not an option within London for lower-paid staff, and transport is a considerable cost. Some staff struggle to keep a car, which they have to pay to park and which now also has to be Ulez compliant. Could London\u2019s mayor offer Freedom Passes to this group of workers, thus targeting help at the lower paid, contributing towards staff retention and helping to keep cars off the road?Sally GilesLondon Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

It is anticipated that an agreement on deep-sea mining in international waters could follow later in the year.Deep-sea mining: why is interest growing and what are the risks?Read moreAfter the vote, the Norwegian government was immediately criticised for going against environmental scientists and the advice of its own experts.Greenpeace called it was \u201ca shameful day\u201d for Norway. \u201cIt is embarrassing to watch Norway positioning itself as an ocean leader while giving the green light to ocean destruction in Arctic waters,\u201d said Frode Pleym, head of Greenpeace Norway. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t end here. The wave of protests against deep sea mining has only begun.\u201dKaja L\u00f8nne Fj\u00e6rtoft, global policy lead for WWF\u2019s No Deep Seabed Mining Initiative, said the organisation was drawing a \u201csmall glimmer of hope\u201d from the fact that extraction licences would still need parliamentary approval, an amendment added after strong international pushback.An energy department source told the Guardian that deep-sea mining had in essence been approved, but it was yet to approve any companies to do so. Deep-sea mining applications will have to be evaluated by the energy department and go back to parliament.The Norwegian government confirmed parliament had voted in favour of opening up for exploration, but declined to comment further. It previously said it would be careful and issue licences only after more environmental research had been done.The Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) said the decision, would act as \u201can irrevocable black mark on Norway\u2019s reputation as a responsible ocean state\u201d.Steve Trent, the foundation\u2019s chief executive and founder, said: \u201cDeep-sea mining is a pursuit of minerals we don\u2019t need, with environmental damage that we can\u2019t afford.

        "text": "As the chair of the Chichester Harbour Trust, one of the most beautiful and important natural harbours in the UK, I witness on a daily basis its now-rapid destruction, caused in large part by an extraordinary deterioration in water quality \u2013 thanks largely, in our case, to Southern Water.I was involved \u2013 as a banker in the 1980s and 1990s working for Kleinwort Benson and Lazard \u2013 with the privatisation of many of the utilities in England. In the case of the water companies, most of them were privatised as sensibly capitalised plcs. As local monopolies, they were regulated by Ofwat with a view to protecting customers from monopolistic pricing behaviour.This approach was carefully thought through by the government on the basis of the business and demographic environment of the time. For some years this worked well in terms of operational efficiency, reliability of water supply and water treatment, and was a good deal for the customer \u2013 perhaps too good.However, from about the start of the 21st century, two key issues were allowed to arise \u2013 neither of which was addressed by successive governments \u2013 that had not been envisaged at the time of privatisation.The first was that these sensibly capitalised plcs were acquired by private equity and infrastructure funds, largely based outside the UK. They used substantial amounts of debt for acquisition, with a view to paying down the debt as rapidly as possible from the strong positive cashflows that these companies generated; this in order to maximise the equity returns. Second, extraordinarily, this policy was aided and abetted by the regulatory regime.This regime disincentivised companies from investing for the long term, in an attempt to minimise water price increases for customers. This was at a time of significant population and housing growth, leading to increased demand for water supply and treatment.There needs to be a policy of marrying housebuilding and development targets with water and other infrastructureDespite warnings to successive governments of impending serious problems, nothing was done. The result is we now have a water industry that is probably 15 to 20 years behind in terms of infrastructure investment. The recent statements coming from ministers, and their lack of a coherent long-term policy, bodes ill for the UK. We can all, of course, blame the water companies, but at the heart of this is the failure by the government to recognise the long-term issues, and to act.Housing and development policy must be linked to the water challenges. At present, water companies are more or less compelled to connect up new developments whether or not they have the necessary water supply or treatment facilities. This is in large part the reason for deterioration of Chichester harbour.The present government appears to have no coordinated strategy to join up policy on housing and water. With the likely acceleration in housebuilding promised by government and opposition, this will massively increase the dire problems facing rivers, harbours and beaches.What is now required is, first, a complete change in the regulatory approach. The government needs to introduce a new regime of regulation by Ofwat \u2013 to encourage companies to invest massively in increasing and accelerating infrastructure and capacity investment. Second, it needs to legislate to introduce rules for the recapitalisation of the water companies. They are all heavily indebted and none of them are likely to be financially viable \u2013 as we are seeing with Thames Water \u2013 if they execute the investment the country requires. To be clear, this should not in my view involve nationalisation, but it will almost certainly require the government to provide significant financial support. It will also mean that customers will need to pay more for their water.And then there needs to be a policy of marrying housebuilding and development targets with water and other infrastructure. We need a team of ministers who take a long-term decisive approach to this, rather than the current team who seem only interested in the short-term politics. If we don\u2019t get the right approach we will end up without a reliable water supply, and serious public health and environmental deterioration. This article was amended on 10 July 2023 to clarify that water companies are privatised in England, not across all four UK nations. In Wales, water is also privately owned but by a not-for-profit company.John Nelson is the chair of Chichester Harbour Trust and a former chair of Lloyd\u2019s of London",

Access tends to be unequal, with poorer communities having fewer opportunities to be in nature.To investigate the link, researchers from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare drew on the responses of 16,000 randomly selected residents of Helsinki, Espoo and Vantaa \u2013 three cities that make up the largest urban area in Finland \u2013 to the Helsinki capital region environmental health survey in 2015-16.The survey gathered information on how city dwellers aged at least 25 experienced residential green and blue spaces within a 1km (0.62-mile) radius of their homes. Green areas included forests, gardens, parks, castle parks, cemeteries, zoos, natural grasslands, moors and wetlands; and blue areas included sea, lakes, and rivers.Respondents were asked to report their use of prescribed drugs for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and for high blood pressure and asthma. They were then asked how often they spent time or exercised outdoors in green spaces, during May and September, with options ranging from never to five or more times a week.The researchers chose prescription drugs as a proxy for ill health. They picked those for anxiety, insomnia and depression, and high blood pressure and asthma in particular because they are used to treat common but potentially serious health issues.They found a strong correlation between visits to green spaces and lower odds of using such drugs. Compared with less than one weekly visit, visiting three to four times weekly was associated with 33% lower odds of using mental health drugs, 36% lower odds of using blood pressure drugs, and 26% lower odds of using asthma drugs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They underwrite 13 mines producing 30.7% of US coal.Coal is the largest contributor of carbon dioxide emissions, and the US is the fourth largest producer of coal worldwide, last year mining 595m short tons \u2013 a measure commonly used in the US equal to 2,000 pounds (907.18 kg).Even though 45 big global insurers have adopted policies limiting coal underwriting in recent years, the report found that some are exploiting loopholes or violating their own policies to continue insuring coalmines.AIG is the biggest underwriter of US coal, insuring seven mines producing 167m short tons in 2022, 28.1% of national output. Lloyd\u2019s of London comes second, with Lloyd\u2019s insurers underwriting 10 mines producing 135m short tons, 22.8% of output.Most of the insurance certificates analysed by the campaign group involving Lloyd\u2019s say \u201cUnderwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London\u201d or \u201cCertain underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s\u201d, without naming the firms.As the world\u2019s biggest insurance market, Lloyd\u2019s has committed to leading the market to a net zero underwriting position, yet it does not mandate or restrict the underwriting policies of its 85 market members.As a member of the Net Zero Insurance Alliance, part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) set up by the UN climate envoy Mark Carney, Lloyd\u2019s has pledged to become net zero as a corporation by 2025, while the investments from its \u00a33bn central fund will be net zero by 2050. The market started divesting from coal in 2018 but has been slower than other insurers.Lloyd\u2019s declined to comment specifically on the report, but said its position remained that as all insurance in the market was underwritten by managing agents, not Lloyd\u2019s itself, it is for the individual businesses that operate in the the company\u2019s market to make their own business and strategy decisions. Lloyd\u2019s will provide guidance and oversight to the market.Lindsay Keenan, the European coordinator of Insure Our Future, said: \u201cLloyd\u2019s is exposed yet again as a leading insurer of the fossil fuels that are causing the climate crisis.\u201dHe added: Other Lloyd\u2019s members, managers, staff and investors need to step up, alongside civil society, and help to persuade their peers \u2026 to firmly commit to stop insuring all coal mining in OECD countries by 2030, and to reduce their coverage of coal by 50% by 2025, in line with the action taken by other leading insurers, as directed by climate science.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Beef cheeks are a lean but tough cut that needs a low and slow approach to tenderise it (which may explain why most beef cheeks are processed into mince, animal feed or simply thrown in an incinerator). I\u2019ve modified Koffmann\u2019s original, using a smaller quantity of a different meat \u2013 in this case venison or lamb steaks \u2013 and more vegetables, to keep costs down, to increase the nutritional variety in the dish, and to make it work as a way to use up an open bottle of red wine (the original uses far more than most people would ever have left over).Red wine-braised venisonPierre Koffmann may be a fine-dining chef, but this dish has its origin in French peasant cuisine. In my recipe, I\u2019ve tried to honour his refined approach while at the same time simplifying the dish by making it in one pot and with zero waste. Instead of beef cheeks, I\u2019m using venison or lamb steaks, which are still relatively economical. The lean, tender and flavoursome meat from a deer is similar in quality to a beef cheek, though you could also make it with another economical beef cut such as shin, brisket or chuck, although if you do, ideally use pasture-reared beef for sustainability and nutritional reasons. To save energy, I\u2019ve braised everything on a stove top instead of in the oven, though if you have the oven running already, the dish will of course cook just as well in there.Serves 22 x 120g venison or lamb steaksSalt and black pepper2 tsp plain or wholemeal flour \u2013 I used wholemeal spelt 2 tsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus a little extra, if need be40g smoked bacon lardons, or 2 rashers smoked streaky bacon, cut into strips 3 shallots, peeled and halved, or 1 small onion, peeled and cut into wedges10 button mushrooms250ml red wine 2 sprigs fresh thyme2 bay leaves2 garlic cloves, peeled2 carrots (about 150g), trimmed and roughly choppedChopped parsley, to finishCoat the two steaks in the well-seasoned flour, then shake off any excess.Put the oil in a small casserole pot on a medium heat, then saute the lardons until golden all over. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon, keeping the fat in the pan, then add the shallots and button mushrooms. Saute until evenly browned on both sides, then scoop out with a slotted spoon. Add a dash more oil to the pan, if necessary, then brown the floured meat on both sides.Pour in the wine, scrape the base of the pan to deglaze as it bubbles up and, once it\u2019sboiling, add the rosemary, bay leaves and garlic. Turn down to a simmer, cover the pan and leave to cook gently for about two hours, until the meat is fork tender.About 30 minutes before the meat is ready, return the onions, mushrooms and bacon to the pan, and add the chopped carrots.

In an article called Jelly for Scrimpers in South Dakota magazine, Laura Johnson Andrews suggests that corn cob jelly most likely originated in about 1875, when settlers began canning jellies, pickles and preserves, including some delicious-sounding pear, cherry and peach pickles. Spent corn cobs are boiled with sugar and set with pectin to create a wildly delicious sweet jelly that is gorgeous spread on toast, pancakes or waffles. I particularly like it with cheese, especially when the jelly\u2019s spiked with jalape\u00f1o.Because of its similarities in appearance at least, some pioneers of the plant-based world have adopted this frugal recipe as an alternative to honey, using a little less pectin to stop the syrup from setting, and to give it a honey-like viscosity. Historically, corn cob jelly has also been used in place of corn syrup, because it\u2019s almost identical in flavour.Corn cob jelly (AKA vegan hot honey)This recipe turns a few spent corn cobs into a delicious sweet treat. It doesn\u2019t matter if there are a few kernels left on the cobs \u2013 they will only add flavour and help turn the liquid into a glorious golden yellow. To give the appearance of honey, I\u2019ve added a little optional turmeric, but it does impart some flavour, so add it only if you like the stuff.I strain the cob cooking liquid to create a clear, honey-like substance, but if you wish, add some corn kernels to the jelly mix before jarring, which both looks pretty and adds a wonderful texture.

That is the lowest level since records began in 1902, passing a previous all-time low set in 2010.After months without rain, Pedro Mendon\u00e7a, an Amazon rainforest villager, was relieved when a Brazilian NGO delivered supplies to his riverside community near Manaus late last week.\u201cWe have gone three months without rain here in our community,\u201d said Mendon\u00e7a, who lives in Santa Helena do Ingl\u00eas, west of Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state. \u201cIt is much hotter than past droughts.\u201dIndigenous Amazonians urge Brazil to declare emergency over severe droughtRead moreSome areas of the Amazon have seen the lowest rain levels from July to September since 1980, according to the Brazilian government disaster alert center Cemaden.Brazil\u2019s science ministry blames the drought on this year\u2019s onset of the climate phenomenon El Ni\u00f1o, which is driving extreme weather patterns globally. In a statement earlier this month, the ministry said it expected the drought will last until at least December, when El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s effects are forecast to peak.The drought has affected 481,000 people as of Monday, according to the civil defense agency in the state of Amazonas, where Manaus is located.Late last week, workers from the Brazilian NGO Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Amaz\u00f4nia Sustent\u00e1ve (FAS) fanned out across the parched region near Manaus to deliver food and other supplies to vulnerable village communities. The drought has threatened their access to food, drinking water and medicines, which are usually transported by river.Nelson Mendon\u00e7a, a leader in Santa Helena do Ingl\u00eas, said although some areas were still reachable by canoe, many boats had not been able to travel on the river to bring supplies, and goods were being transported by tractors or on foot.\u201cIt\u2019s not very good for us, because we\u2019re practically isolated,\u201d he said.Luciana Valentin, who also lives in Santa Helena do Ingl\u00eas, said she was concerned about the cleanliness of the local water supply after the drought reduced water levels.\u201cOur children are getting diarrhea, vomiting, and often having fever because of the water,\u201d she said.",

The nests are designed to encourage the eagles to establish territories and breed in the coming years.The chair of the project, Michael Clarke, said: \u201cWe are delighted to see so many estates supporting the South of Scotland Golden Eagle project and recognising the importance of this iconic species. As a top predator, golden eagles help to maintain healthy ecosystems. They support the survival and prosperity of all healthy prey species, and are brilliant for ecotourism, too.\u201dThe Duke of Northumberland said he was thrilled that golden eagles had re-established themselves in southern Scotland.\u201cIt has been exciting to see these magnificent birds occupy a range close to Burncastle,\u201d he said. \u201cThe estate was very keen to play a part in helping the birds, and the opportunity to build the eyries on Burncastle will hopefully raise the prospects of new chicks being born in the future.\u201dOne of the sub-adult birds seen in the area. Photograph: South of Scotland Golden Eagle ProjectIllegal persecution has brought the golden eagle to virtual extinction outside its Highlands stronghold. There were between two and four pairs of golden eagles across Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders before the project began in 2018. Scientists calculate there is habitat suitable for 16 pairs.According to the project\u2019s manager, Dr Cat Barlow, estates including grouse moors have been keen to join the project because the eagles help to manage predators.\u201cIn the absence of golden eagles, predator species such as crows and foxes and even buzzards are probably at slightly abnormal levels. Having golden eagles around on an estate might balance things out a little bit.\u201cEstates also want to demonstrate what they are doing for biodiversity and are keen to show that the history of persecution is in the past now.

Golden eagles typically begin to breed at three or four years old.Ross Ewing, the moorland director at Scottish Land & Estates, said: \u201cThe role of private estates, many of which have grouse shooting interests, in supporting the South of Scotland Golden Eagle project has been pivotal in many ways, including the provision of 90% of the eagle chicks translocated from north to south.\u201d",

Updrafts result in warm surface air being pushed up higher into the atmosphere. \u201cIt\u2019s more buoyant than the cooler air and it starts to rise like a hot air balloon.\u201dHailstones form via a combination of updrafts, moisture in the air, and cold enough temperatures high in the atmosphere. \u201cThe stronger the updraft is, the larger hailstone that can form,\u201d Raupach said.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nWind shear \u2013 changes in horizontal wind direction or speed at different heights in the atmosphere \u2013 is also a factor. \u201cWhen you have high wind shear, that causes storms to become more severe and more likely to form hail,\u201d he added.A decrease in wind shear across Australia\u2019s mid-north over the four decades corresponded with a reduced frequency of hail-prone days, the researchers found.Soderholm said: \u201cIn the north, there is lots of heat and humidity, but the wind shear is low, so it\u2019s not ideal for hailstorms. In the south, we have too much wind but not enough heat and moisture. Our most frequent [hail storm] environments are around the Brisbane to Sydney region, because it\u2019s an optimal balance.\u201cThat climatic region \u2013 we\u2019ve seen it in the trends starting to shift farther south. One explanation could be due to climate change.\u201dThough hail frequency has increased significantly around Perth over time, hailstorms over south-west Australia were far less frequent than over the south-east, Soderholm said.The researchers analysed historical data of conditions favourable for hailstorms, as well as information from the BoM\u2019s long-term weather radar archive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So you might see a decrease in frequency \u2026 but an increase in severity.\u201d\u201cBut what we see from studies across the world \u2026 is that when you look at trends, information and simulations, they don\u2019t always align with that broad expectation, because there\u2019s so much geographical variability and there\u2019s so many other factors that are in play.\u201dPrevious research, co-authored by Raupach, has found that hailstorm frequency is generally expected to increase in Australia with climate change.\u201cOne of the reasons that we\u2019re interested in doing this research is to provide the information that could help with increasing resilience, whether that\u2019s in cities where the materials that we build structures out of have an effect on how much damage you get from a hailstorm, or agricultural regions where farmers need to decide which crops to plant,\u201d he said.According to the Insurance Council of Australia, the costs of the 1999 Sydney hailstorm would amount to an estimated $8.85bn in insured losses if it occurred in 2023, outstripping the costs of the devastating 2022 south-east Queensland and New South Wales floods.The study was published in the journal npj Climate and Atmospheric Science.",

We know extreme heat is going to get worse, and additional research will help us better quantify future change.\u201dThe fingerprint of climate change is being identified across the planet. The risk of extreme drought across California and Nevada was made six times worse by the climate crisis and a strong periodical La Ni\u00f1a climate event from October 2020 to September 2021, while, conversely, extreme rainfall that deluged parts of the UK in May 2021 was 1.5 times more likely due to global heating.A severe hot spell in China in February 2021 was made between four and 20 times more likely because of human-caused climate change, while acute drought in Iran, which it experienced in 2021, is now 50% more likely because of the greenhouse gases humanity has pumped into the atmosphere.A swath of other severe impacts can be attributed, at least in part, to the influence of the climate crisis, including the weather that caused a dangerous wildfire in Cape Town, South Africa, in 2021 to be 90% more likely than if we had never heated up the planet and even the persistent cloudiness over the Tibetan plateau that reduced vegetation growth, caused, researchers say, by elevated global temperatures along with abnormal winds and localized pollution.The compendium of research, presented by Noaa at a conference on Monday, draws together some of the latest examples of climate attribution, where scientists have managed to pinpoint the influence of human-induced climate change upon individual weather events and disasters.Previously, Herring said that scientists were very reluctant to talk about the climate change influence upon discrete events, preferring a more general probabilistic framing, but that this messaging has \u201cevolved over time as the research has increased\u201d into more exact attribution methods.Using increasingly powerful climate models, along with historical observations, scientists are now able to provide more a precise, and rapid, assessment of the influence of the climate crisis on certain disasters. The heavy rain that caused devastating floods in Nigeria, Niger and Chad last year, for example, was made about 80 times more likely by the climate crisis, one study has found.Herring warned that many of the temperatures now being seen are well beyond any modern historical norms and are pushing humanity into a new, dangerous state. A heatwave in South Korea in October 2021, for example, was so drastic, at almost 7F higher than normal, that it would be considered an event that would only happen every 6,250 years. But the climate models predict that this will become the new normal for South Korea by 2060 if planet-heating gases are not radically cut.The same fate may well await the normally temperature Pacific north-west of the US, where around 600 people died as a roasting heatwave pummeled the region in 2021. A subsequent study found the climate crisis made the heatwave 43 times more likely.\u201cHuman-caused climate change is an extreme disruption of the Earth system,\u201d said Paul Higgins, associate executive director of the American Meteorological Society.\u201cWe should expect it to lead to more extreme events, as this new research helps to show. We must do what we can to help people, and all life, thrive in spite of this danger.\u201d",

        "text": "Thousands of emperor penguin chicks across four colonies in Antarctica are believed to have died because of record-low sea ice levels that caused a \u201ccatastrophic breeding failure\u201d in late 2022, according to new research.Analysis of satellite images showed the break-up of usually stable sea ice and the disappearance of the colonies at a time when chicks had not yet grown their waterproof feathers.Scientists have said emperor penguins face an uncertain future under global heating because they are so reliant on sea ice, which is projected to decline as the world\u2019s oceans heat up.The breeding failures in the Bellingshausen Sea were \u201cwithout precedent\u201d, the research said, as it was the first time multiple colonies across a large region had all failed in a single season.Antarctic sea ice compared to long-term average\u201cIt\u2019s a grim story,\u201d said Dr Peter Fretwell, a researcher with the British Antarctic Survey and the lead author of the research. \u201cI was shocked. It\u2019s very hard to think of these cute fluffy chicks dying in large numbers.\u201cWe had predicted it for a long time. The sea ice loss has been unprecedented and far quicker than we imagined.\u201dAntarctic sea ice shrank to a record low in February, which followed a record low the year before, in events that have shocked scientists.Large patches of brown guano \u2013 a buildup of excrement \u2013 on the white sea ice make emperor penguin colonies visible from satellites.The study, published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, observed the sea ice breaking apart from late October to early December at colonies at Verdi Inlet, Smyley Island, Bryant Coast and Pfrogner Point.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nMany parts of the region had near total loss of sea ice. Fretwell estimated as many as 7,000 chicks may have perished.\u201cIn some cases it\u2019s possible the sea broke up into smaller floes or under the feet of the penguins,\u201d he said.\u201cIf they get immersed, the chicks will drown. If they get back on to the ice floes, they will freeze because they don\u2019t have their waterproof feathers at that stage.\u201dSome breeding was possibly successful at one colony in the region, at Rothschild Island, because icebergs may have helped to stabilise the ice giving the chicks the chance to fledge.Where did all the Antarctic sea ice go? \u2013 podcastRead moreDuring a previously recorded breeding failure at a large colony in the Weddell Sea, Fretwell said adults had likely moved to another colony less than 100km away.\u201cThat\u2019s why this regional failure is so difficult [for the penguins] because they can\u2019t just go to the nearest colony,\u201d he said.\u201cA 1,500km region in length has lost almost all its sea ice. We have no real idea what happens if there\u2019s no ice.\u201dAbout 30% of the known 62 emperor penguin colonies in Antarctica have been affected by partial or total sea ice loss since 2018.Emperor penguins \u2013 featured in the animated Happy Feet films \u2013 are unusual in that they have not come under pressure from hunting, fishing or loss of habitat.Global heating is considered their main long-term threat, with projections that by 2100 about 90% of colonies could be so small that they are essentially extinct.Dr Barbara Wienecke, a senior research scientist at the Australian Antarctic Division, has made dozens of visits to emperor penguin colonies.She said the research, which she was not involved in, provided little doubt that thousands of chicks had died.By October chicks form \u201ccreches\u201d while both their parents are out catching fish, she said, but are \u201cnowhere near being waterproof\u201d.\u201cThey still have their downy plumage. If the ice breaks out before they can safely enter the water, the plumage becomes waterlogged and, basically, the chicks die of exposure.\u201cIt\u2019s horrendous and I find it extraordinarily distressing to think of this happening.\u201dBoth Wienecke and Fretwell said projections of the future for the penguin species may have to be revised, with the risk potentially greater than previously feared.Dr Jeremy Wilkinson, a sea ice physicist at the British Antarctic Survey, said the research \u201cdramatically reveals the connection between sea ice loss and ecosystem annihilation\u201d.Fretwell said: \u201cWhat\u2019s most devastating for me is that we know this will get worse before it gets better. This is the trajectory that we are on.\u201cIt\u2019s only by changing our behaviour and the amounts of fossil fuels we use will we reverse the trajectory for these emperor penguins, and many other species.\u201cHow bad it gets is still up to us.\u201d",

The comments were made in response to a question from activist shareholder Stephen Mayne, citing past coverage from the Guardian.Macquarie has had enormous success buying public infrastructure and placing it in its funds, where it can charge fees, and receive dividends, as well as enjoy any increase in the asset price.It has also enjoyed recent success in its commodities business, earning the head of that division, Nick O\u2019Kane, A$57.6m over a 12-month period, which is more than the chief executive\u2019s salary.Shareholders recorded a near 20% protest vote against Macquarie\u2019s remuneration report at the general meeting in a notable sign of opposition to its large pay packets.",

The animals will be closely monitored as they transform a former commercial pine plantation into a wild wood.Longhorn cattle in the Kent woods. Photograph: Donovan WrightThe ancient breeds act as ecosystem engineers, with the bison stripping bark from trees and creating the deadwood needed by insects, as well as trampling down corridors of light to spur new plant growth. The ponies complement this by clearing soft vegetation, while the pigs dig around looking for roots and bulbs, spurring new seeds to germinate. The longhorn cattle open up the tree canopy and their actions will be compared with those of the bison. All the changes will encourage bats, birds and other creatures to thrive.\u201cThis is where the project really starts to come to fruition,\u201d said Paul Hadaway, of Kent Wildlife Trust (KWT), which runs the project along with the Wildwood Trust. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the bison now for eight months settling into this site and doing some amazing stuff. But the intention was always to have as close to a natural grazing assemblage as we could recreate.\u201cIf you go back to when these English woodlands first evolved, they would have had mega-herbivores. So this is about returning back to that kind of natural management, to create a much more climate-resilient, adaptable landscape. The pigs are each capable of ploughing about four acres of land a year.\u201dAlison Ruyter, also of KWT, said: \u201cWilder grazing is about using native wild breeds of livestock to mimic the things that mega-herbivores would have done in the past when wild horses, aurochs and bison roamed around the country.\u201dThe five-strong bison herd was completed in December with the arrival of the bull. The surprise birth of a calf was revealed in October. One of the females was already pregnant on arrival in Kent, but bison disguise their pregnancies in order to avoid being targeted by predators.Exmoor ponies are expected to clear soft vegetation. Photograph: Donovan WrightThe bison and cattle herds will be accompanied by ponies, with the pigs moving between the two groups. The rewilding success of each group will be compared with an area with no large herbivores and managed by humans.All 9,000 bison living in Europe today are descended from just 12 zoo animals, which rescued the species from extinction in the early 20th century. The Kent bison are currently in a 50-hectare (123-acre) area. But this should expand to 200 hectares in the summer once large tunnels are built to enable the gentle giants to cross public footpaths without encountering people.Bison in Kent.

It announced earlier this month that it had secured \u00a3750m of funding from existing investors on top of \u00a3500m received earlier this year, but still needed a further \u00a32.5bn to improve its infrastructure and cut its debt pile.On Friday, the rating agency Moody\u2019s downgraded Thames Water from B1 to B2 amid ongoing concerns about whether the current run of equity injections will be enough to stabilise its credit quality.It warned a further cut could be on the way, should Ofwat impose a \u201cdividend block\u201d on Thames in response to its finances and growing criticism of the company\u2019s dumping of raw sewage overflows into waterways.Thames is one of five water companies with legal powers to fit meters.

        "text": "A maximum indoor temperature working law giving people a day off if workplace temperatures surpass 30C should be mandated by government, a new report recommends.The report by the Fabian Society thinktank highlights inequalities in who bears the brunt of the impacts of climate breakdown and puts responsibility on bosses and landlords to stop people from overheating.An increasing number of people are dying from excessive heat in the UK. More than 4,500 people died in England in 2022 due to high temperatures, which was the largest figure on record. Between 1988 and 2022, almost 52,000 deaths associated with the hottest days were recorded in England, with a third of them occurring since 2016, data from the Office for National Statistics shows. During the same 35-year period analysed, more than 2,000 people died in Wales due to the warm temperatures.Drawing on advice from experts from a range of organisations including the National Infrastructure Commission, the London School of Economics and the University of Oxford, the Fabians have drawn up a plan to prevent illness and death from the increasing extreme heat predicted to happen in the UK due to climate breakdown.These include introducing a specific maximum indoor working temperature law, including the ability to withdraw labour if workplace temperatures surpass 30C, or 27C if doing strenuous work.It found that \u201clow-paid workers often lack sufficient access to water, can not escape the heat, and have to wear uniforms or personal protective equipment (PPE) designed for cooler temperatures.\u201d Hospitality and manual workers are most likely to face excessive heat, but also employees in education establishments and offices can suffer if they are working on higher floors or in areas with big windows and poor ventilation. Workers in better-off households are less likely to work in jobs where they are at risk of overheating.A duty should also be put on landlords to prevent overheated homes, based on the existing requirements for landlords to prevent cold homes, the authors said. They added that homeless people should be protected by a requirement on councils to activate the severe weather emergency protocol in extreme weather events and provide temporary accommodation for rough sleepers for the duration of the severe weather alert, and a minimum of three nights.The report also calls for tougher climate resilience requirements on infrastructure providers, and a ban on the burning on upland peatlands as well as investment in the maintenance of flood defences currently in poor condition.Action to stop climate inequality has not been taken by the current government, the report states. It says: \u201cThe Conservative government\u2019s most recent National Adaptation Programme lacks substantive new plans or investment to prepare for future climate impacts. This leaves low-income households especially vulnerable. Those on low incomes are more likely to face the worst impacts of extreme weather events and are less likely to be able to adapt.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

One advert that ran in April stated: \u201cLabour have done nothing for you other than spend millions on trying to tax you to drive with Greens and Lib Dems.\u201dThe start date for a Manchester CAZ, which would be the UK\u2019s largest outside of London, has been delayed after disagreements between the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and the government over funding.Area breakdownMisinformation about the Manchester CAZ has been widely shared on Facebook, according to separate analysis using the analytics tool Crowdtangle.The most popular organic post mentioning the scheme claimed that authorities had cut down trees by a motorway junction near Wigan in order to install CAZ signage. The post later received 43,000 interactions on Facebook when it was reposted by a meme page.A spokesperson for Highways England, which manages the land around the Orrell Interchange, said no trees had been removed to install the sign.Trafford Conservatives said in a statement: \u201cOn Thursday, voters in Trafford have a choice. They can vote for a Labour council\u2019s 493 square mile charging zone, supported by the Liberal Democrats and Greens, who all want to make it more expensive and more difficult to get to work, to see your family or to get around your day.\u201cAlternatively, they can vote for a fresh start with the Conservatives, who will prioritise making life easier for hard working families and small businesses.\u201dIn London, which has the highest coverage of low-traffic neighbourhoods in the UK, Conservative candidates placed 65 ads pledging to remove them. The highest number were run by local parties in the outer suburban boroughs of Croydon and Enfield.Enfield Conservatives said the Labour administration had not listened to people about two new LTNs and created \u201cmore pollution, more congestion\u201d.Official monitoring data from Enfield council shows traffic volumes inside its Fox Lane LTN fell by 72% on average after its introduction, while boundary roads saw an average increase of 6%.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am BSTStephen Edwards, the chief executive of Living Streets, said: \u201cNobody wants to vote for dangerous roads, air pollution and rat running. The government\u2019s own evidence shows that there is overwhelming support for traffic reduction and space being reallocated to people walking, wheeling and cycling.\u201d\u201cOf course, if low-traffic schemes aren\u2019t working, authorities should be working with residents to find other ways to reduce car dominance and prioritise people.\u201d This article was amended on 4 May 2022.

Protest plays an essential part in our society in raising public awareness and enabling change.\u201dIn 2022, parliament passed a host of anti-protest laws written specifically to tackle climate protesters, and more are proposed in a public order bill being considered by MPs.Among the new laws was a statutory offence of causing a public nuisance, which was used to convict Jan Goodey, a university lecturer from Brighton, after he climbed a gantry over the M25 to stop traffic.

The charity is calling on UK governments to better manage all stocks and collect more data, with monitoring involving cameras.UK may ban sandeel fishing in move to save threatened seabirdsRead moreCharlotte Coombes, Good Fish Guide manager at the MCS, said: \u201cThe north-east Atlantic mackerel population has been declining since 2015, which is concerning. Fishing communities and wildlife depend on this species, but continued overfishing is putting both at risk.\u201dMackerel is caught by various states, including Norway, Iceland, the UK, and countries in the EU. Currently, these countries are not working together to tackle overfishing of the species, the charity said. Coombes said countries need to agree on quotas \u201cto protect stocks\u201d.In October 2021, the main fishing states again agreed that total mackerel catches in 2022 should not exceed the scientific advice (794,920 tonnes), but not how the catches should be divided. The combined catch limits set by all countries for 2022 totalled 1,131,416 tonnes, exceeding the advice by 42%.During March 2023, countries met to decide how to divide the next set of quotas. However, nothing was decided and talks are continuing.The UK takes about 17% of the total mackerel catch, mostly from Scottish boats. In 2021, more than 220,000 tonnes of mackerel were caught \u2013 32% of the total UK catch \u2013 worth about \u00a3240m.Mackerel is important prey for whales, dolphins, and tuna, the charity said, adding that removing too much of this species could have wider environmental effects.Only 15 ratings have joined the green-rated \u201cbest choice\u201d list this spring. The MCS use a traffic light system \u2013 green, red and amber \u2013 to show where fish rank, with mackerel moving to the amber list. An amber rating means that improvements are needed, in this case, better management to end overfishing of the stock.Despite the bad news for international fishing, mackerel caught by hand line in south-west England remains green-rated. This is a low-impact way of fishing, and catches are strictly controlled. There are also protections in place for juvenile mackerel to make sure they can reproduce before they are caught.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Ozone levels over the Antarctic are expected to bounce back to 1980 levels by 2066.The ozone hole is usually smaller during El Ni\u00f1o years, but modelling by Jucker and collaborators, including Chris Lucas of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, has suggested it will be larger than usual in 2023, due to long-lasting atmospheric changes after the undersea Tonga volcano explosion in January last year.

It gets its \u201cgolden\u201d name from oily secretions that lubricate its fur so it can \u201cswim\u201d through sand dunes. This means it does not create conventional tunnels, making it all the harder to detect.00:00:22Sand-swimming golden mole burying into sand after rediscovery \u2013 videoIt is also blind, relying on its highly sensitive hearing, and bolting if it senses vibrations caused by movement above ground. It has been featured among the \u201cmost wanted\u201d on a list of lost species compiled by the global conservation group Re:wild.The mole has now been rediscovered 86 years after its last sighting, thanks to a two-year search by conservationists and a border collie dog called Jessie, who was trained to sniff out golden moles. Their findings have been published in the journal Biodiversity and Conservation.\u201cIt was very exciting to be part of a team looking for lost species. The cherry on the cake is finding one,\u201d said Esther Matthew, senior field officer at the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT).A De Winton\u2019s golden mole on the dunes in South Africa. Photograph: JP Le Roux/re:wildResearchers from EWT and the University of Pretoria worked with Jessie the dog, who alerted them by lying down on the spot when she found the scent. Jessie was rewarded for her efforts by being allowed to play with her tennis ball.Each time she stopped, they collected a soil sample, which was later tested for environmental DNA (eDNA). This detects DNA from skin cells, urine, faeces and mucous, which the moles release as they move through the dunes. Using this technique, the team searched up to 18km (11.2 miles) of dunes in a day. They collected 100 samples of sand in total, and eventually encountered two De Winton golden moles.Tracks left by the mole, which can \u2018swim\u2019 through the sand.

A Hawaiian herb known as Phyllostegia glabra var lanaiensis will remain after new surveying shows that new habitats may be suitable for the plant.The ivory-billed woodpecker, once set for delisting, was also kept amid debate of its extinction status.The move to delist the extinct species began in September 2021.The US secretary of the interior, Deb Haaland, emphasized the importance of wildlife conservation in a 2021 statement, when the initial delisting process was proposed.\u201cWith climate change and natural area loss pushing more and more species to the brink, now is the time to lift up proactive, collaborative and innovative efforts to save America\u2019s wildlife,\u201d Haaland said, highlighting the importance of the ESA.A majority of the species listed were included on the ESA in the 1970s and 1980s.

Photograph: Geoff Looney/The GuardianWaterNSW said it had increased monitoring at Menindee lakes in recent months to track water in the wake of the floods.\u201cRecent results indicate that while dissolved oxygen levels have fallen at key monitoring points within the lakes, the area of most concern at this stage is Lake Wetherell in the vicinity of the main weir,\u201d it said.The fish kill follows reports from Menindee residents who say they have been concerned for weeks about the \u201cenormous amounts of carp\u201d in the river system.\u2018Smells like sewage\u2019: blackwater from Victorian floods causes mass fish deathsRead moreMenindee photographer Geoff Looney said he saw hundreds of dead fish at the weir, mainly carp and bony herring, with \u201cthousands of carp\u201d trying to get in.\u201cI do a lot of fishing and I\u2019d never seen so many carp in the river,\u201d he said.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\n00:01:03Waterways plagued with invasive carp after floods in the Murray-Darling Basin \u2013 videoProf Fran Sheldon, a river ecologist who was on the independent panel on the 2019 Menindee fish kills, said the carp were struggling to breathe because they didn\u2019t cope as well as other fish when water quality declined.\u201cThe carp are really visual because they\u2019re coming up and gasping for air,\u201d she said.\u201cWhereas the native fish probably do that a bit less, so you don\u2019t see them as much. They\u2019re not probably as obvious to the people there but there would be a lot of native fish out there as well.\u201dBased on the ecology of the Menindee lakes, Sheldon said, there would likely be a lot of bony bream affected by the low oxygen levels, but \u201cthey won\u2019t be at the surface like you see with the carp\u201d.Thousands of dead carp wash up on South Australia\u2019s beachesRead more\u201cNow this will be like a domino effect because the more carp die, the worse the water quality will get and then more die. You\u2019ll start to get deoxygenation because the carp start to rot and when they start to rot that sucks the oxygen out of the water.\u201dSheldon said it was not unusual for fish populations to boom during floods, followed by \u201cmass mortality of fish\u201d as flood waters receded, but that she was concerned about the large carp population.\u201cIt just highlights the massive numbers of carp in the Murray Darling Basin, which is an issue,\u201d she said. \u201cThese fish really do dominate the biomass now of the system, and they never used to and that in itself is a bit of a tragedy.\u201cFor the system, it\u2019s a good thing that they all die out \u2026 If these fish all ended up back in the river, it\u2019d be a complete disaster.\u201dThe DPI said it would continue to work with Water NSW and would undertake sampling between Weir 32 and Menindee Main Weir of the fish population once flooding receded.\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community\n",

        "text": "A 16-year-old European hedgehog called Thorvald has been crowned the oldest in the world, smashing the previous record by seven years.The male hedgehog lived near the town of Silkeborg in the centre of Denmark. Dr Sophie Lund Rasmussen, from the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU) at Oxford University, who led the Danish Hedgehog Project that discovered Thorvald, said she was overwhelmed when she discovered how old he was.\u201cI cried tears of joy that I was holding an individual that lived for 16 years. That\u2019s really good news for conservation. Under the right conditions, hedgehogs can live for 16 years \u2013 it\u2019s amazing. All my colleagues were laughing at me because they thought I was being so emotional,\u201d she said. The previous record-holder was thought to be a nine-year-old female hedgehog in Ireland, identified by researchers in 2014.Unfortunately Thorvald died at Animal Protection Denmark\u2019s wildlife rehabilitation centre in Silkeborg in 2016 after being set on by a dog, a common cause of hedgehog mortality. Rasmussen says dogs should be kept on leads or locked up at night when hedgehogs are out. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad that he lived for so long and then died after being attacked by a dog.\u201dThorvald was one of almost 700 dead hedgehogs collected by 400 volunteers as part of the citizen science research. They also found a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old, according to the paper, published in the journal Animals.The bodies were sent to researchers who worked out how old they were by counting the growth lines in their jawbones, rather like counting tree rings. This research is significant as hedgehogs numbers are in decline across many European countries, their loss driven by habitat destruction, intensification of agriculture, road traffic incidents and the fragmentation of populations. In the UK, rural populations have fallen by as much as 75% in some regions in just 20 years.Hedgehog jaws are prepared for age determination. Researchers count growth lines in the jawbones, rather like counting tree rings. Photograph: Sophie Lund RasmussenThorvald had infected bite wounds on his stomach and back; infection had also caused his penis to become extremely swollen. \u201cIt was the largest hedgehog penis I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Rasmussen, who said that otherwise the hedgehog was generally healthy \u2013 indicating that the mammals could live even longer than 16 years.However, the average age of the animals studied was two, with a third of hedgehogs dying before the age of one. Researchers believe that if hedgehogs can get over the tough first years they could go on to have long lives and produce offspring for several breeding seasons. \u201cThis may be because individual hedgehogs gradually gain more experience as they grow older,\u201d said Rasmussen. \u201cIf they manage to survive to reach the age of two years or more, they would have likely learned to avoid dangers such as cars and predators.\u201dThey found that male hedgehogs lived longer than females \u2013 reaching an average of 2.1 years, as opposed to 1.6 years \u2013 which is unusual in mammals. Rasmussen said: \u201cThe tendency for males to outlive females is likely caused by the fact that it is simply easier being a male hedgehog. Hedgehogs are not territorial, which means that the males rarely fight. And the females raise their offspring alone.\u201dMore than half were killed when crossing roads, with deaths peaking in July when males and females are walking long distances trying to find mates. Another 22% had died at rehabilitation centres after being collected by the public and 22% of natural causes in the wild.Counting growth lines on jaw bones is an effective way to age hedgehogs because their metabolism slows down during winter and bone growth is reduced or stops altogether. One line represents one year.Prickly business: the hedgehog highway that knits a village togetherRead moreAnother key finding of the paper was that inbreeding did not appear to reduce their life expectancy. Finding an unrelated mate is increasingly a problem for hedgehogs as populations shrink.Rasmussen said: \u201cOur research indicates that if the hedgehogs manage to survive into adulthood, despite their high degree of inbreeding, which may cause several potentially lethal, hereditary conditions, the inbreeding does not reduce their longevity. That is a rather groundbreaking discovery, and very positive news from a conservation perspective.\u201dFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

        "text": "Starbucks recently announced that it has developed six new varieties of coffee seeds that can withstand the effects of climate change, which some experts say is \u201ccritical\u201d for the future of coffee.People in the US drink about 517m cups of coffee a day collectively, with the average American consuming three cups on a daily basis. But coffee, like many other crops, is under threat due to the climate crisis \u2013 subject to diseases, droughts and extreme weather conditions.Most of the coffee consumed worldwide comes from two species \u2013 arabica and robusta. Accounting for 70% of global coffee production, the arabica bean is more popular and for a good reason. Its smoother flavor, lower acidity and fruity hints rank paramount to robusta\u2019s grainy, more bitter flavor. Native to Ethiopia and predominantly grown in Central and South America, arabica is the only bean that Starbucks uses in its nearly 37,000 locations worldwide. But its sensitivity to rising temperatures makes it especially vulnerable to premature ripening and crop loss.\u201cMore researchers doing work that will provide climate resilient varieties is critical,\u201d said Sarada Krishnan, a coffee grower and scientist at the Crop Trust, a nonprofit dedicated to conserving crop diversity. Robusta, a thicker bean, is generally more favorable to heat, and therefore easier to grow. Arabica on the other hand, with its low genetic diversity, is more susceptible to diseases like coffee leaf rust \u2013 a fungus that can overtake the plant when the conditions are warmer and wetter.\u201cWhen smallholder farmers get that, they lose and their whole income for the year is gone,\u201d Krishnan, who owns an arabica coffee farm in Jamaica and knows the challenges of dealing with the disease first-hand, said. \u201cLast year toward the end of the harvest, the rust came, and if you let the rust take over then you lose the plant and it will take five years to get a fruit crop.\u201dStarbucks-developed arabica seeds are cultivated to resist the leaf rust and tests have been shown to generate a higher yield in a shorter period of time. According to the company, the Starbucks agronomy team plants several different varieties and hybrids of seeds, monitoring the trees\u2019 resistance to diseases and nutrient absorption through at least six generations or about 12 years.\u201cStarbucks is committed to ensuring the future of coffee,\u201d said a representative of the company in an email. \u201cWe have a responsibility to care for the entire supply chain and the many people who make coffee possible, from bean to cup, farmer to customer.\u201dThe company is giving away its six climate-resilient coffee tree varieties to farmers who are free to sell the resulting crop to buyers other than Starbucks. The coffee giant buys from about 400,000 farmers across 30 countries, and over the last five years, it has given away three million climate-resistant seeds annually, developed by others to farms in Costa Rica, Honduras, Peru, Mexico, China, Indonesia, Guatemala and Nicaragua.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "The duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, two of the royal family\u2019s largest portfolios of land, have snubbed tree campaigners who are calling for the royals to rewild their estates.Rewilding advocates at the campaign group Wild Card have been meeting for months with the crown estate, which manages most of the royal land and pays the revenue into the Treasury. They say relations have been \u201creally positive\u201d.However, the duchies are separate to the crown estate, and not subject to the same level of accountability. The two organisations \u2013 described by the land campaigner Guy Shrubsole as \u201cmedieval anachronisms\u201d \u2013 manage more than 73,000 hectares (180,000 acres) of royal land between them, with all profit going directly to the royal purse.Queen\u2019s jubilee tree planting sponsors \u2018linked to deforestation\u2019Read moreBoth estates have lower levels of tree cover than the national average. The duchy of Cornwall, run by Prince Charles, has only 6% tree cover, and the duchy of Lancaster has 13%. The average in the UK is 16%, while in Europe it is 38%.But neither have responded to repeated requests from Wild Card for a meeting about afforestation, and sources say they have ruled out ever meeting the rewilders.\u201cThe duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster have categorically ruled out meeting with our campaign. This is an appallingly undemocratic affront to our futures,\u201d said Emma Smart, campaigns manager for Wild Card, which has highlighted the lack of forest cover on royal land.The group has delivered a 100,000-signature petition and emailed the duchies on nine occasions, but has had no response.Wild Card is asking the royals to practise what they have preached during the Queen\u2019s jubilee tree-planting scheme and allow more trees to grow on their own land.Across the country, people have been asked to \u201cplant a tree for the jubilee\u201d to mark the Queen\u2019s 70-year reign. The Queen\u2019s Green Canopy scheme will dedicate a network of 70 ancient woodlands across the UK, and identify 70 ancient trees to \u201ccelebrate Her Majesty\u2019s 70 years of service\u201d.Joel Scott-Halkes, a co-founder of Wild Card, said: \u201cGiven that the ancient medieval duchies are exempt from freedom of information requests and corporation tax, it is sadly little surprise that they consider it beneath them to engage with a democratic people\u2019s led campaign. If they don\u2019t rewild soon, it would be understandable if people proposed their abolition.\u201dRoyal land is broken up into the crown estate, which is roughly 116,000 hectares, the duchies, which between them are just under 75,000 hectares, and some other smaller holdings.The crown estate belongs to the reigning monarch \u201cin right of the crown\u201d \u2013 it is owned by the monarch for the duration of their reign by virtue of their accession to the throne. It is not the monarch\u2019s private property, and they cannot sell it \u2013 all profits go directly to the Treasury, which then passes a portion back to the crown.Unlike the duchies, representatives from the crown estate have been responsive to Wild Card. Hazel Draper, the communications coordinator at Wild Card, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had several positive meetings with the crown estate and things are looking really positive. They\u2019re clearly keenly aware of the urgency of the climate and ecological emergency, and we believe a nature restoration commitment may soon be on the horizon.\u201dThe duchy of Lancaster owns about 2,020 hectares (5,000 acres) of grouse moors on the North York Moors and about 180 hectares (450 acres) of grouse moors in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire. Campaigners have said much of this land lies on peat bogs, which should be allowed to grow wild to sequester carbon instead of being used for grouse shooting.The duchy of Lancaster comprises almost 18,500 hectares and made \u00a320m in profit in 2018. The duchy of Cornwall has 54,632 hectares, nearly double its size in the Victorian period. This makes the Prince of Wales the biggest private landowner in England.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am BSTLast year more than 100 scientists wrote to the royals asking them to help tackle the biodiversity crisis by rewilding some of their vast estates.

Gas prices experienced a 50% rise in 2021, reaching the highest they have been since 2014. Fuel prices have only continued to climb, hitting an average of $4.12 a gallon in the past few months.At Shell, chief executive and chief financial officer raises were made for their \u201csignificant personal contributions \u2026 in delivering the strategic progress of 2021\u201d, said Curtis Smith, Head of Americas Media Relations at Shell, in an email to the Guardian. Shell\u2019s boss, Ben Buerden, received a $2m raise in 2021.Shell\u2019s profits quadrupled and BP\u2019s net profit rose to an eight-year high in 2021, while Exxon reported its highest profits since 2017 in the last quarter of 2021.\u201cAmericans will not soon forget that when they were struggling to fill their tanks, oil and gas companies made record profits and decided to give that money to wealthy industry executives and shareholders rather than stabilizing gas prices,\u201d said Kyle Herrig, president of government watchdog Accountable, which produced the report.The oil industry has defended surging fuel prices on the grounds of a spike in crude oil costs, inadequate supplies for a sudden hike in fuel demand after a lull during the pandemic and, more recently, the Russia-Ukraine war.The Biden administration has accused big oil of price gouging. The US was actually a net exporter of petroleum in 2021, and also boosted overall crude production. At the same time, although crude oil costs dropped over the last month, prices at the pump across the US still remained markedly high.Consumer advocacy groups take a dim view of oil firms. \u201cThey are causing people to have to choose between putting food on the table and putting gas in the tank. And that\u2019s a choice that people shouldn\u2019t have to make,\u201d argued Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog.",

Wildfires have burned almost 64,000 hectares in Spain in the first seven months of the year, according to Spanish government data.According to EU figures, the 2022 wildfire season was the second worst on record, with blazes devouring 1,624,381 hectares \u2013 an area of land roughly equivalent to Montenegro.

        "text": "Most companies sponsoring the UN climate talks in Dubai are not committed to cutting their greenhouse gas emissions in line with globally recognised net zero targets, it has been revealed.Only one of the more than 20 sponsors of Cop28 has signed up to UN-backed net zero science-based targets, (SBTi), according to an analysis.Most of the corporate sponsors, which include the oilfield services company Baker Hughes as well as Bank of America, have made no commitment to reduce emissions to net zero in any time period under the target system.The global accountancy firm EY, formerly Ernst and Young, which has been hired as the independent verifier of the climate record of all the sponsors, has also not set targets with the net zero scheme.The targets are recognised as one of the leading voluntary global validations of a company\u2019s commitment to tackling global heating.The targets are clearly defined science-based pathways for companies and financial institutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and they are reviewed and validated by the SBTi.Six firms sponsoring the Dubai climate talks, which begin on 30 November, including EY, have made a commitment to set net zero targets, by registering with the scheme. This requires them to submit their plans for validation within 24 months.But only one corporation, the renewable energy company Iberdrola, is a validated member of the SBTi scheme, with a fully committed target date for cutting its emissions.The sponsorship committee in the United Arab Emitrates, which holds the Cop presidency this year, said organisations seeking to sponsor the event were required to submit their commitments to net zero and climate action as part of their sponsorship applications.But its wording leaves wriggle room for sponsors, saying they need to be signed up to \u201ccredible net zero transition plans by 2030 and 2050 based on SBTi\u201d, rather than the globally recognised scheme itself.Lincoln Bauer of Spendwell, which carried out the analysis, said: \u201cScience-based targets are the gold standard validation system for companies. The fact that so few of the sponsors are signed up to their net zero targets, and that EY itself, chosen to verify the climate commitments of the sponsors, doesn\u2019t have set targets yet, suggests this is just greenwashing.\u201dThe SBTi is recognised as a reputable global validation scheme to encourage big corporations to cut their carbon footprint. This year Amazon was removed from the scheme after suggesting it was not going to meet its promised emissions reductions.Amazon had pledged in 2019 to eliminate or offset all of its carbon emissions by 2040, signing up to voluntary targets with the SBTi in 2020 to verify its progress. The net zero standard requires companies to set long-term science-based targets to cut all possible emissions before 2050. Most companies must reduce emissions by more than 90%.EY is heavily involved in the climate talks, providing what the company says is a team of experienced professionals from around the world to \u201cprovide insights on the road to Cop28 and beyond \u2026 by supporting organisations in planning, integrating and making tangible progress in their sustainability commitments\u201d.But its own climate record has been put under scrutiny by the Spendwell analysis. It has made an initial commitment to produce a decarbonisation target but not gone further.Bauer said: \u201cJust like the sponsorship criteria implies, every one of these companies should have a net zero commitment with SBTi as a bare minimum. Most do not. Our report is about leadership as much as it is about anything else. These companies are claiming to be climate leaders through Cop sponsorship, but are they living up to that claim with verifiable follow-through?\u201dEY said it was making significant progress on its science-based decarbonisation target, which was launched in January 2021 and approved by the SBTi.\u201cEY has reduced absolute emissions globally by more than 43%, while at the same time the organisation has grown, both in terms of revenue and people, by over 40% against a 2019 [financial year] baseline,\u201d the company said.\u201cAs the first phase of our decarbonisation plan concludes, EY remains on track to achieve an ambition of becoming net zero in 2025. We are planning for the next phase through to 2030 and this includes assessing our plans against relevant standards, including SBTi.\u201dA spokesperson for Baker Hughes said: \u201cWhile not a current member of SBTi, Baker Hughes has commitments that are aligned to SBTi\u2019s sector-agnostic target setting standards to keep the global temperature increase below 2C compared to pre-industrial levels. As part of the sponsorship requirements for Cop28, Baker Hughes transparently shared its targets to the Cop28 envoy team for their review and verification by a third-party provider.\u201dBank of America did not respond to a request to comment.",

        "text": "The EU is under pressure to significantly restrict its huge fleet of fishing vessels from using \u201cfish aggregating devices\u201d that make it easier to catch huge numbers of fish and contribute further to overfishing.A letter signed by Marks & Spencer and more than 100 environmental groups, including the International Pole and Line Foundation, warns EU officials that the devices (FADs) are one of the main contributors to overfishing of yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean, because they catch high numbers of juveniles.FADs have a \u201chigh environmental cost\u201d, they say, because endangered turtles, sharks and marine mammals are often caught when the devices are encircled in massive \u201cpurse seine\u201d nets of large tuna vessels. Lost, discarded or abandoned FADs can also cause environmental damage.The EU should lead by supporting tough action to curb use of the tools, as a meeting with regulators, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), starts in Mombasa this week, the groups say.Yellow fin tuna packed for market in Tenerife, Spain. The species has been overfished in the Indian Ocean since 2015. Photograph: Phil Crean A/AlamyYellowfin tuna, one of the fastest and strongest marine predators, have been overfished in the Indian Ocean since 2015. The region\u2019s bigeye tuna stock was also recently assessed as overfished.Sainsbury\u2019s and German chain Edeka, have previously joined Marks & Spencer in calling for states to monitor, manage and restrict FADs, to reduce overfishing and rebuild yellowfin stocks.Up to 300 free-floating FADs, typically consisting of a raft and submerged material where fish gather, can be used by a single vessel. Thousands are lost or abandoned every year. A rise in FAD use by industrial vessels has led to increased scrutiny of their impact on marine ecosystems. Many retailers, including Sainsbury\u2019s and M&S, sell own-brand \u201cFAD-free\u201d tuna.The 33 parties to the IOTC are gathering from 3-5 February to discuss proposals to monitor, manage and restrict FAD use. India has submitted a proposal to ban FADs used by purse seine vessels. A proposal by the EU suggests using biodegradable material in FADs to mitigate environmental harm, as well as increasing traceability and accountability and restricting FAD use per vessel to 280 by 2024 and 260 by 2026.But tougher measures are needed to safeguard stocks, protect the environment and ensure transparency, environmentalists say. \u201cEveryone agrees FADs are a problem,\u201d said Stephen Ndegwa of Kenya\u2019s agricultural ministry. \u201cWe should agree a precautionary principle to protect the environment, but the EU\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t restrict FADs enough.\u201dUnlike Kenya, the Maldives and other coastal states without subsidised distant-water fleets, the EU could fish elsewhere if the stocks collapse, he said. \u201cIf the stock is depleted here, the EU can go to another ocean. But the coastal states have nowhere else to go. The EU wants scientific evidence, yet the stocks are collapsing. Why wait for scientific evidence if the stocks are in bad shape?\u201dThe IOTC is the only tuna regulator that does not restrict FADs at certain times of the year, Ndegwa said.Kenya wants to ban FADs for three months every year, halve the number used per vessels to 150, and introduce a register of the devices to better identify and track them.

Company officials wanted to make sure the efforts could not be traced back to Syngenta, the documents showed. The agency ultimately chose someone else for the panel.Why does the US allow a controversial weedkiller banned across the world?Read moreIn comments to the Guardian in October 2022, Syngenta denied paraquat caused Parkinson\u2019s and said the weight of scientific evidence demonstrated no causal link between the chemical and the disease. When asked about the Cory-Slechta correspondence, a representative said: \u201cWe disagree and take exception to this mischaracterization.\u201d A spokesperson for the EPA told the Guardian in 2022 thatscientific research \u201cdoes not support\u201d a causal relationship between the chemical and the disease. The EPA responded to the allegations laid out in the Fault Lines piece by telling Al Jazeera the agency was \u201ccommitted\u201d to ensuring its decisions were \u201cfree from unwarranted interference\u201d.McCormack described a culture of \u201cregulatory capture\u201d at the EPA and said that colleagues who spoke out in favor of more stringent regulations on pesticides were often sidelined.\u201cIf you do decide to work for the [EPA] pesticide program and you go up against the agricultural interest, it will not be good for your career,\u201d she said.When reached by the Guardian for comment, the EPA referred to the statement they had previously given Al Jazeera.",

Agricultural shows are key events in the Lake District calendar, where locals and visitors meet to share a day of competitions and socialising.I have many happy memories of showing sheep at Hawkshead, but this year the reduced format meant that there were, sadly, no sheep on the field. Instead, I take the dogs to compete in the dog show. We had had a very successful Ravenstonedale show recently, winning the best small dog and best puppy prizes.After our entry fee of \u00a31 was paid, we joined the throng of people and their animals waiting for the pet classes. The working dogs were shown first \u2013 sheepdogs, terriers and lurchers \u2013 followed by the pets. I had entered Elsie, a wire-haired dachshund, in the cutest puppy class.

It was believed he had Sunak\u2019s support, and the government claimed removing these rules for housebuilders could unlock more than 100,000 homes.The nutrient neutrality scheme, aimed at saving England\u2019s rivers from being overloaded with nitrates and phosphates, which cause algal blooms and choke oxygen from rivers, allows developers to pay for \u201ccredits\u201d to improve local wetland areas. This allows them to offset pollution caused by new homes that would overwhelm sewage systems in sensitive areas. The proposed new law would have allowed planning officials to ignore the extra pollution caused by sewage from new homes in sensitive areas and runoff from construction sites, with the taxpayer paying for the offsets instead.Previously the government had planned to put the bill, aimed at boosting housebuilding by taking away costs from developers, into the King\u2019s speech. This is no longer planned to be the case.Gove told an event at the Conservative party conference earlier this month that he planned to bring a bill to scrap nutrient neutrality to the House of Commons \u201cas soon as possible provided the prime minister lets me\u201d.Sunak appears to have performed a U-turn, as government sources said ministers would now find alternatives to primary legislation to unblock homes currently in breach of nutrient neutrality rules.Ministers previously tried to dismantle the rules via an amendment to the levelling up bill. Because it was a last-minute addition, it did not go to the Commons and instead was voted on by the Lords.The peers delivered an astonishing defeat to the government when they voted against the amendment, which would have forced local authorities to turn a blind eye to pollution from new developments.It was brought over the line when Labour\u2019s shadow environment and levelling up secretaries, Steve Reed and Angela Rayner, declared they would support a vote against the amendment.Reed said of the government\u2019s plans to drop the legislation from the king\u2019s speech: \u201cIf correct, this is a huge win for Labour and environmental campaign groups over this relentlessly anti-nature Tory government. They could build the homes British people need without trashing nature.

Colour me very happy.\u201dNature and green groups have celebrated the government U-turn. Joan Edwards, director of policy at the Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cWe are relieved the UK government is abandoning attempts to get rid of nutrient neutrality rules that exist to stop water pollution becoming even worse.

        "text": "Last Friday, I was arrested along with a group of climate activists for blocking the entrance to the East Hampton airport in New York and stopping private jet arrivals and departures. Many people have asked me why.The truth is I am terrified of the future of our climate, and I believe that non-violent civil disobedience is the best way to create transformative change. I have covered disruptive protest and social issues in my films, and supported movements through philanthropy. So, at 63, I decided it was time for me to stand in protest with other activists, to put my body on the line.My father owned a 737 with a queen-sized bed. I loved that thing so much. I loved the men and women who flew the plane and took care of the plane, people I\u2019d known since childhood.It all seemed so benign, and when something makes your life so seamless that you barely notice what you are doing, it can be difficult to acknowledge the problems you are causing, especially when those problems are impersonal and remote. Flying in Europe up to 30 times cheaper than train, says GreenpeaceRead moreBut one day, flying all alone from California to New York, I had an epiphany. My comfort and convenience suddenly seemed like ridiculously small issues when held up against the climate freight-train that is barreling down the tracks at us.Our planet is wrapped in a blanket of pollution so thick and unforgiving that it is becoming unlivable. While my one flight across the country was not enough to cause this on its own, I was still contributing to a catastrophic collective consequence that everyone else on Earth is already paying for.The life of a wealthy person burns up a lot of carbon \u2013 through superyachts, frequent travel on private jets and helicopters, and multiple enormous homes. According to Oxfam, billionaires emit a million times more greenhouse gases than the average person.This is not an accusation. My father was a good and decent man, and so are most of the people who own private planes. But we are facing an active emergency, and decency is worthless when unaccompanied by meaningful action, including a vigorous inquiry into the consequences of our personal choices and preferences. And niceness is a hollow virtue if we do not lift a finger to keep our children and grandchildren safe.It is a rich irony that most of the focus on behavior change in the face of climate change centers around the small changes working-class Americans should make, from giving up plastic straws to paying exorbitant gas taxes, to recycling and composting.But what have we asked of the wealthy? If just a handful of very wealthy people were to change just a handful of their behaviors, they could make more of a difference in one trip than millions of working-class people can in their lifetimes. Just a four-hour flight on a private jet will burn as much carbon as the average person does in a year.Yes, the people who own private jets make up a small sliver of the population. It\u2019s tempting to think it\u2019s not a significant enough number to make a difference. But the number of private planes only grows. Since the beginning of the pandemic, private jet use has jumped an astonishing 23%. Some 5.3m private jet flights occurred in 2022 alone, with the total expected to jump again in 2023.First principles matter. My own first principle is to do no harm. In an enormously complicated world, this can be difficult. But more often, the answer has been right in front of you all along.I will continue to try to make up for the willful ignorance I deployed when I enjoyed my father\u2019s plane, through my philanthropy and activism, but that will never be enough. Carbon offsets and more efficient fuels are nice, but at best get us to break even. We need more. A lot more.I hope other wealthy people will join me in ditching their planes. A tiny sliver of the population could decide right now to make a difference by making a series of relatively small sacrifices. (Have you checked out first class lately? It\u2019s pretty posh!) If it means averting catastrophe and making the thriving of your children and grandchildren possible, isn\u2019t that the least you can do?And if you are really ready to dive in, come join me at the next protest. This article was amended on 21 July 2023 to remove text stating that \u201c50% of aviation carbon emissions are caused by private flights\u201d, which was based on a misreading of a different statistic.\nAbigail E Disney is an Emmy-winning documentary film-maker and activist and the great-niece of Walt Disney\n",

However, Otis rapidly intensified en route to making landfall in Mexico, with winds increasing by about 70mph in just 12 hours, leaving little time for preparations to be made.This rapid intensification was one of the largest on record in the eastern Pacific and was fuelled by high ocean temperatures and reduced wind shear, which refers to a change in wind speed or direction with a change in height. The rapid and unexpected intensification of Otis was not accurately captured by weather models, in part because of limited data availability, with no radar available in the area it made landfall and only one flight taking place to make observations.00:00:59Hurricane Otis: before and after footage shows scale of destruction in Mexico's Acapulco \u2013 videoAcapulco is home to more than 1 million people.

The Maui Food Bank has listed three emergency collection and distribution centers for meal and grocery distribution.Hawaiian Electric, the utility company that oversees Maui\u2019s power company and provides utility service to 95% of residents in the state, is being scrutinized for failing to deploy a \u201cpublic power shutoff plan\u201d in response to big wind events that could incite fires.State emergency management records showed no indication that warning sirens were triggered before the fires. But Governor Josh Green said it has been too early to know whether the emergency siren system failed.Ella Tacderan, a Hawaii resident, told the Guardian about losing her family home in Lahaina in the wildfire.\u201cWe get wildfires all the time. This time it was different,\u201d Tacderan said. \u201cIt was a nightmare. None of us have gotten any sleep. I have a total of five families for housing and all of their homes are burnt down to the ground with nothing, just ashes.\u201dA graphic posted by the Pacific Disaster Center and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) provided an updated property damage assessment for the Lahaina fire: 2,207 structures damaged or destroyed; 2,170 acres burned; 2,719 structures exposed and 86% residential building exposure. The graphic also outlined needs as of Saturday, including 9,000 ready-to-eat meals daily; 3,560 gallons of water a day; 450 waste bins (25-gallon size); and 51,700 sq ft of shelter for 4,500 people.The estimated rebuild cost is $5.2bn, according to the Pacific Disaster Center and Fema.",

Though discharged, his condition meant he could not fly. He and his mom therefore set off to drive to Casselton, North Dakota, scheduled to arrive on Tuesday or Wednesday, KPHO, an Arizona news station, reported.Brian Kauffman, Wyatt\u2019s father, said: \u201cI\u2019m thankful he\u2019s coming home in the front seat of the car instead of a [coffin] in the back.

I just remember somewhat waking up and being in the back of an ambulance, and a helicopter, and then the plane\u201d to the hospital.Rescue crews spent two hours using ropes and a Stokes basket to retrieve Wyatt. He was eventually flown to a pediatric trauma center in Las Vegas, to be treated for nine broken vertebrae, a ruptured spleen and a collapsed lung. He was also treated for a concussion, a broken hand and a dislocated finger.Doctors said a complete recovery would take a long time.

Giving with one hand and taking with another, by diverting cash from an already depleted aid budget, won\u2019t help those on the frontline of this crisis. Any backsliding on this commitment would leave any remaining semblance of the UK\u2019s global climate leadership in tatters.\u201dSunak has drawn up plans to ditch the promise, the Guardian revealed earlier this month, after a leaked document showed officials had warned that the spending commitments to climate breakdown mitigation in the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries were not being made.The \u00a311.6bn is the UK\u2019s contribution to the $100bn of climate finance from wealthy countries that was pledged in 2009 at Cop15 in Copenhagen has still not been delivered by rich nations.The UK spent \u00a35.8bn over the previous five years up to 2021.

These domes are huge spherical lenses that sit on a pair of long, silvery eye tubes \u2013 hence its common name, the barreleye fish (Macropinna microstoma).The green tint (which actually comes from a yellow pigment) acts as sunglasses, of a sort, to help them track down their prey. There\u2019s nowhere to hide in the open waters of the deep ocean and many animals living here have glowing bellies that disguise their silhouette and protect them \u2013 bioluminescent prey is hard to spot against the dim blue sunlight trickling down. But barreleyes are one step ahead.Q&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world\u2019s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth \u2013 and how much there is to protect.\u00a0Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Their eye pigment allows the fish to distinguish between sunlight and bioluminescence, says Bruce Robison, deep-sea biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California. It helps barreleyes to get a clear view of the animals trying to erase their shadows.Discovered in the deep: meet Casper the ghostly octopusRead moreThe barreleye\u2019s tubular eyes are extremely sensitive and take in a lot of light, which is useful in the inky depths of the twilight zone. But Robison was initially mystified that their eyes seemed fixed upwards on the small spot of water, right above their heads.\u201cIt always puzzled me that their eyes aimed upward, but the field of view did not include their mouths,\u201d says Robison. Imagine trying to eat scraps of food floating in front of you, while fixing your eyes on the ceiling.But, after years of only seeing dead, net-caught specimens, Robison and colleagues finally got a good look at a living barreleye through the high-definition cameras of a remotely operated vehicle. \u201cSuddenly the lightbulb lit and I thought \u2018A-ha, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on!\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can rotate their eyes.\u201d This means the fish can track prey drifting down through the water until it is right in front of their mouth.Seeing a barreleye alive in the deep, Robison saw something else that scientists had previously missed. \u201cIt had this canopy over its eyes like on a jet fighter,\u201d he says, referring to the transparent front part of the barreleye\u2019s body, which had been torn off all the specimens he had previously brought to the surface.He thinks this canopy probably helps protect their eyes as they steal food from among the stinging tentacles of siphonophores \u2013 animals that float through the deep sea in long, deadly strings, like drift nets.Barreleyes have been found with a mix of food in their stomachs, including siphonophores\u2019 tentacles, as well as animals that siphonophores feed on, including small crustaceans called copepods. Their tactic may be to swim up to siphonophores and nibble on the small prey snagged in their tentacles, using the transparent shield to protect their green eyes from stings.But encountering barreleyes in the wild is not easy. In his 30-year career, Robison says he has only seen these 15cm-long fish alive maybe eight times. \u201cWe do spend a lot of time exploring down there, so I can say with some confidence that they\u2019re quite rare,\u201d he says.",

These are what some of the consequences of political failure on the climate look like, and they only get far worse.Helen Clarkson, chief executive, the Climate GroupAustralia has done this \u2013 the last election was fought on the climate. There was a huge gap opening up between what people could see with their own eyes and what they were being told by the previous government on the climate.

Wildlife campaigners say it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d that ministers have \u201cignored the science\u201d and allowed the use of these dangerous chemicals.The matter was discussed at the latest meeting of the government\u2019s expert committee on pesticides on 12 September. While the pesticide has been banned in the EU for years, it was allowed for emergency use until this year, when it was banned entirely. Now the UK has left the EU it is able to make its own rules on pesticides. Recent research found that 36 pesticides banned by the EU are not ruled out for use in the UK.The pesticides are toxic for bees but are also, at certain levels, toxic to aquatic life, and build up in river systems.New research by the Rivers Trust and Wildlife and Countryside Link (WCL) found that one or more of five neonicotinoids \u2013 four of which are banned in the EU \u2013 were found in more than one in 10 English river sites tested by the Environment Agency (29 of 283 sites). At 55% of these 29 sites one or more neonicotinoids were above the EU\u2019s proposed environmental quality standard (EQS) \u2013 the level deemed safe for aquatic wildlife. Twenty one per cent of sites had one or more toxic pesticide at over four times the safe level.Rivers most affected by the pesticides were found in the east of England, south-east England and West Midlands in rivers including the Ivel, Waveney, Nene, Ouse and Tame.Barnaby Coupe, the land use policy manager at the Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cThis research reveals that our rivers and waterways are plagued by a cocktail of neonicotinoid pesticides, despite these chemicals being banned since 2018.\u201cIt is completely unacceptable that the government is allowing these chemicals to pollute the environment when the evidence for the disastrous impact of neonicotinoids grows year on year. It has ignored the science and the advice of its own experts in granting repeat authorisations to apply toxic neonicotinoids to our countryside, and the result is much diminished wildlife.\u201dGareth Morgan, the head of farming at the Soil Association, said: \u201cYear after year this failure to help farmers has led to the suspension of the so-called ban on these bee-harming pesticides. With so much of British wildlife in decline, it is critical that the government stops kicking the can down the road on this issue. Organic and agro-ecological farmers are proving that food can be produced without pesticides. Government must act now to help all farmers switch to nature-friendly practices across their entire farms.

        "text": "Rishi Sunak plans to restrict the installation of solar panels on swathes of British farmland, which climate campaigners say will raise bills and put the UK\u2019s energy security at risk.Last year, then prime minister Liz Truss attempted to block solar from most of England\u2019s farmland. The plans were deeply controversial and unpopular, and were dropped when she left office.However, solar panels in the countryside are disliked by many rural Conservative MPs, and the Observer can reveal that Sunak and environment secretary Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey have revived plans to put new restrictions on this form of cheap renewable energy.This is the latest weakening of green policies before the general election, which started when the Conservatives won the Uxbridge byelection, a result widely attributed to anger at Labour mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s ultra low emissions zone. Sunak recently announced that the 2030 phase-out of new petrol and diesel cars will be pushed back to 2035, as well as weakening the 2035 gas boiler phase-out, confirming it will apply to far fewer homes. The government also plans to scrap pollution rules for housebuilders in sensitive areas, where they are currently not able to add to sewage pollution without paying to improve nearby wetlands.It has also faced criticism for its record on renewables, with its stance on onshore wind referred to by industry as an effective block, and the recent government renewable energy auction failing to sign up any offshore wind.Sunak will further dilute green policies, say campaigners, by giving new powers to planning officials in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). These would allow officials to block any solar project that can be argued to \u201cput food security at risk\u201d \u2013 that is, anywhere food is grown.Ministers are understood to believe that food security should be on par with energy security and will use recent climate breakdown-related food shortages in Europe and the war in Ukraine as justification for the change.Rishi Sunak has revived plans to put new restrictions on solar panels. Photograph: Juan Medina/ReutersThe framework amendment to the NPPF was drafted by Greg Smith, the MP for Buckingham, who has long campaigned against solar panels on farmland. He said: \u201cThis is a clear, straightforward protection that planning authorities up and down the land can use to say this development on this farmland isn\u2019t going to hit our food security in this area, or this one over here is and therefore use that as a good reason to turn down applications.\u201dCoffey confirmed the NPPF will be coming out later this year and that \u201cthe first purpose [of farmland] must have to be about food production\u201d.Energy experts have strongly criticised the plans. Lydia Collas, senior policy analyst at Green Alliance, said: \u201cSolar energy will help us move away from polluting fossil fuels, and in the long term protect UK farming from climate breakdown.

Scientists have documented similar findings in rhesus macaques.But sociality seems to play a different role in animals that don\u2019t necessarily live in groups. A 2018 paper in yellow-bellied marmots \u2013 a \u201csocially flexible\u201d species \u2013 linked strong social relationships to decreased longevity.Whether longevity confers any evolutionary advantage is contentious.

Animals bred in captivity develop physical changes that may hinder survival in the wild, research findsRead more\u201cThey want to imply that group-living species live longer. But it\u2019s much more complicated than that. [Lifespan] is tied to their ecology. It\u2019s tied to their reproductive biology, it\u2019s tied to their mating system.\u201cWhether you\u2019re a solitary animal or a group-living animal, you have to learn to live with others \u2026 and you will compete with others for access to resources.\u201dFrere added that social organisation varied significantly among group-living mammals, ranging from highly structured dominance hierarchies to fission-fusion societies, in which the size and makeup of social groups change over time.The research was published in the journal Nature Communications.",

It then promised to swiftly release a \u00a310bn national overflows plan.The government and Water UK planned to publish the plans by late summer after requesting them in April.Newly released documents, revealed after Freedom of Information Act requests submitted by the Good Law Project, show the environment minister Rebecca Pow wrote to water companies asking for action plans which \u201cstrike the right balance between speed and affordability and deliverability\u201d and asked them to submit them by 18 August for publication. She added that some water companies had still not provided data for their plans, and had first asked for these plans in April. By August she was still requesting information from water companies.Conservative \u2018failures\u2019 have led to more sewage pollution, say water expertsRead moreDr Lucinda Gilfoyle, the head of environmental strategy at Water UK, also promised last May that there would be a national overflow plan published in the late summer which focuses on how investments will be used to deal with overflows and excess rain water.

Releasing the information at this stage on an adhoc basis would divert resources away from ongoing work. The water companies need to ensure that it is finalised, quality assured and signed off before publication takes place.\u201dA spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \u201cLast year we demanded a clear action plan on every storm overflow from water companies, prioritising those that are spilling at a high level and into bathing waters or high priority nature sites.

Aquifers feed rivers to keep their flows at a healthy level, and are also important sources of water when reservoirs or other sources run low.There are strict limits on the amount of water that companies can take from aquifers, as rivers can be damaged and an important emergency water source for local people is lost if they are drained. Campaigners have previously said water companies should be fixing leaks in the system and building reservoirs rather than over-abstracting water from the environment.United Utilities was prosecuted at Warrington magistrates court and was given the fine on Tuesday after the Environment Agency found the company had taken more water than its abstraction licences allowed in the Franklaw and Broughton borehole complex.Carol Holt, the Environment Agency area director for Lancashire, said: \u201cWhile water companies are allowed to abstract water from the environment, over-abstraction, especially during times of prolonged dry weather, has damaging impacts to our environment.\u201cOur actions as regulator have led to today\u2019s sentencing and we will continue to strive for a better water sector across the country to protect our precious water supplies now, and for the future.

It just seems such a paradox.\u201dDolphins \u2018shout\u2019 to compensate for human-made background noiseRead moreA central puzzle was how whales manage to generate sufficient flow of air, given that at 1,000 metres below the surface the pressure is so great that the air in the whale\u2019s lungs is crushed to 1% of the volume it would occupy at the surface.The latest work shows that as whales dive deep below the surface, their lungs collapse and air is compressed into a small muscular pouch inside the mouth.To make a click, the whale opens a valve on the pouch for about a millisecond causing a high pressure blast of air to pass through a vibrating structure in the nose, called the phonic lips. \u201cWhen the lips slap back together, that\u2019s what makes the click,\u201d said Madsen. The clicks, used to navigate and hunt prey, can reach volumes equivalent to a very powerful rifle being fired.The study, carried out over a decade, used high-speed video recorded through endoscopes, and collected audio recordings, using electronic tags, from trained dolphins and porpoises, and sperm whales and false killer whales in the wild. The researchers approached the huge marine mammals at sea in small boats and waited for them to come close in order to attach lightweight recording devices.\u201cMany whales will come up to us and have a look and echo-locate on the boat,\u201d said Madsen. \u201cI sometimes wonder who is studying who \u2013 except they don\u2019t put a tag on us.\u201dThe recordings revealed three distinct registers. \u201cThey can cover a very large frequency range \u2013 much larger than an opera singer,\u201d said Madsen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Well, these crunchy, spiced chickpeas are a nutritious, low-waste and tasty alternative that, thankfully, won\u2019t give me the same guilt or weight gain after eating them. If you\u2019ve already got the oven for something else, rather than dry-frying them as here, roast the chickpeas in there for 10-20 minutes, until golden brown, then coat them in the spiced aquafaba mixture and return to the oven for another five to 10 minutes, until crunchy. All the flavourings are optional, and to suit your own tastes, so play about.If have any leftover aquafaba, store it in a jar in the fridge, where it will keep for up to a week, ready to whip up into aquafaba mayonnaise, or to make meringues or my favourite plant-based caesar salad.Serves 1-4 as a snack1 x 400g tin chickpeas3 tbsp aquafaba\u00bc unwaxed lemon or lime (ideally organic), zest finely grated and juiced (optional)1 tsp dried herbs (optional)1-2 tsp ground spice or a spice mixture (optional)1 small pinch chilli flakes or powder, or to taste (optional)Sea salt, to tasteDrain the chickpeas into a bowl, to capture the aquafaba, then tip the chickpeas on to a clean tea towel and pat dry.

That company knows it needs to transition,\u201d Kerry said after attending an energy conference in the Emirati capital. \u201cHe knows \u2013 and the leadership of the UAE is committed to transitioning.\u201dStill, Abu Dhabi plans to increase its production of crude oil from 4m barrels a day up to 5m even while the UAE promises to be carbon neutral by 2050 \u2013 a target that remains difficult to assess and one that the Emirates still hasn\u2019t fully explained how it will reach.Kerry pointed to a speech al-Jaber gave Saturday in Abu Dhabi, in which he called for the upcoming Cop \u2013 or Conference of Parties \u2013 to move \u201cfrom goals to getting it done across mitigation, adaptation, finance and loss and damage\u201d. Al-Jaber also warned that the world \u201cmust be honest with ourselves about how much progress we have actually achieved, and how much further and faster we truly need to go\u201d.\u201cHe made it absolutely clear we\u2019re not moving fast enough. We have to reduce emissions. We have to begin to accelerate this transition significantly,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cSo I have great confidence that the right issues are going to be on the table, that they\u2019re going to respond to them and lead countries to recognize their responsibility.\u201dEach year, the country hosting the UN negotiations nominates a person to chair the talks. Hosts typically pick a veteran diplomat as the talks can be incredibly difficult to steer between competing nations and their interests. The nominee\u2019s position as \u201cCop president\u201d is confirmed by delegates at the start of the talks, usually without objections.Al-Jaber is a trusted confidant of UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. He also led a once-ambitious project to erect a $22bn \u201ccarbon-neutral\u201d city on Abu Dhabi\u2019s outskirts \u2013 an effort later pared back after the global financial crisis that struck the Emirates hard beginning in 2008. Today, he also serves as the chairman of Masdar, a clean energy company that grew out of the project.Skepticism remains among activists over al-Jaber, however. A call by countries, including India and the United States, for a phase down of oil and natural gas never reached a public discussion during Cop27 in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in November.Activists worry that Cop being held in a Mideast nation reliant on fossil fuel sales for a second year in a row could see something similar happen in the Emirates.Asked about that fear, Kerry said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe UAE was involved in changing that.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a level of scrutiny \u2013 and and I think that\u2019s going to be very constructive,\u201d the former US senator and 2004 presidential contender said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to help people, you know, stay on the line here.\u201d\u201cI think this is a time, a new time of accountability,\u201d he added.",

The sentencing decision was handed down this week after a hearing in November.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nThe offence occurred at Beemery farm near Bourke in north-west NSW, one of 11 properties owned or co-owned by Peter Harris. The court heard that Peter Harris is involved in businesses that hold 40 water access licences covering 112 extraction sites, and relied on his 30 years of experience as an irrigator rather than checking his assumptions against the specifics of this particular licence.In the sentencing decision, Justice John Robson said the pair were guilty of an offence against s.91G (2) of the NSW Water Management Act for taking water in contravention of a term of the water use approval. But he did not find they did so for financial gain.\u201cAccepting the defendants\u2019 submissions, and conscious that a large volume of water was extracted unlawfully, I find that there is no evidence that establishes beyond reasonable doubt that either defendant committed the offence for financial gain,\u201d Robson said.Robson sentenced the pair separately, with Peter Harris fined $40,000 and Jane Harris $20,000. The maximum penalty for each offence at the relevant time was $247,500.The Harrises were also ordered to pay WaterNSW\u2019s legal costs for the five-year-long case, which amounted to at least $448,260, plus additional costs that are yet to be determined.They also have to place an ad in key rural newspapers within seven days of the judgment being handed down, publicising the offence.The court said the market price for water transfers during the 2016-2017 water reporting year was $23.11 a ML, making the approximate value of the water extracted at Beemery Farm $44,000.Drought and flooding rains: the Murray-Darling Basin water rights balancing actRead moreBut the Environmental Defenders Office (EDO) said that even when including costs, the total financial penalty was \u201cdisappointing\u201d and points to shortcomings in the regulation of water resources in NSW.\u201cIt is a disappointing outcome when the theft of water on such a large scale \u2013 almost 2bn litres \u2013 results in $60,000 in fines,\u201d EDO special counsel Emily Long said.\u201cA penalty of this size is unlikely to deter large agribusinesses from breaking the law.\u201dLong questioned the effectiveness of a regulatory regime which results in penalties that could, for a large player, be absorbed as a \u201ccost of doing business\u201d.\u201cWater is a scarce community resource that should be treasured and shared equitably. At the moment, that is not happening, and communities are suffering,\u201d she said.In the initial 2020 decision they were also acquitted of taking water from the Barwon River while their meters were not working in 2015, after the court found the prosecutors had failed to establish all the elements of the offence.The Inland Rivers Network vice-president, Mel Gray, said the fine handed down to the Harrises \u201cisn\u2019t commensurate with the crime\u201d.A spokesperson for WaterNSW said it \u201cacknowledges the court\u2019s decision without further comment\u201d.The Harrises, through their lawyer, declined to comment.In February, an irrigator on the Moree Plains was fined a record $350,00 in the first successful prosecution of a tier 1 water offence by the Natural Resources Access Regulator (NRAR), after they pleaded guilty to knowingly taking water, using an under-recording meter system and constructing an unlawful dam.\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community\n",

        "text": "The fight against the climate emergency is being hampered by a debt crisis that involves the world\u2019s poorest countries paying more than 12 times as much to their creditors as they are spending on measures to tackle the impact of global heating, a campaign group has warned.As the Cop28 meeting opened in the United Arab Emirates, Development Finance International (DFI) said a new round of comprehensive and deep debt cancellation was needed to free up much-needed investment in climate emergency adaptation.A study of spending in 42 countries by DFI found debt service payments represented 32.7% of the budget in 2023 on average, while responding to the climate crisis stood at 2.5%.Indonesia, the world\u2019s fourth most populous country, plans to spend just 0.12% of its budget on adapting to the climate crisis in 2024 while payments to creditors are expected to be 29%, the report said. Most of the countries studied expect to spend less than 2% of their budgets on climate adaptation \u2013 and many would be investing less than 1%.Matthew Martin, DFI\u2019s executive director, said a major programme of debt cancellation on the scale of the initiatives of the late 1990s and early 2000s was needed. Debt service averaged 38% across 139 countries in the global south, rising to 57.5% for the low-income countries.Martin said: \u201cIf the international community is serious about confronting the climate crisis, they need to get serious about comprehensive debt relief for a wide range of countries.\u201cIf we bring countries\u2019 debt service down to 15% of their revenues, as under the heavily indebted poor country initiative, we will have enough money to confront the climate crisis head-on.\u201dThe report by DFI, a debt campaign group, said debt was already playing a key role in preventing countries from scaling up investments in tackling global heating.The struggle to repay creditors might even be exacerbating the climate crisis, with countries forced to maximise exports to generate the foreign exchange required to meet the high cost of servicing debt. This has often meant continuing fossil fuel extraction that was profitable in the short term and even expanding fossil fuel projects, potentially delaying their own energy transitions in the process.Attempts to reduce debt burdens are being conducted on a country-by-country basis under the Common Framework, a mechanism established by the G20 group of leading developed and developing countries at the start of the global pandemic in 2020. Only a handful of countries have so far received any debt relief, and DFI said that, even then, the Common Framework had failed to free up room for spending on climate adaptation.In a separate move, more than 550 economists, development and climate experts, NGOs and activists, including leading economists Thomas Picketty and Jason Hickel, philosopher Ol\u00faf\u1eb9\u0301mi T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2 and climate activist Vanessa Nakate, have signed an open letter calling for debt cancellation at Cop28.The statement calls for the cancellation of the debts of lower-income countries \u201con the frontline of the climate emergency\u201d and for rich countries to significantly increase levels of grant-based climate finance.",

A report published last week found that dredging was unlikely to be the cause of the die-offs, suggesting an unidentified new pathogen could have been to blame, but the findings have been criticised by some scientists.The EA report paints a bleak picture of England\u2019s coastal regions, with fewer than a fifth of the UK\u2019s estuaries judged to be at good ecological status. Only 45% of the marine areas assessed met the standard in 2021, according to the report, published on Thursday.More than nine in 10 of the estuaries sampled had nitrogen levels that were too high in 2019, as did nearly half of coastal waters. Nitrogen pollution comes from agricultural runoff and sewage, and can cause harmful algae blooms that kill off marine life and smother seagrass and saltmarsh.The report found that there had been \u201cwidespread damage to coastal defences, properties and infrastructure\u201d during storms, with about 100,000 people at risk of significant coastal flooding.Sand dunes were being lost to erosion, and wetlands were drying out under the influence of the climate crisis, the report found. About 85% of England\u2019s salt marshes, a major carbon store, have been lost since the 1800s, along with about half of seagrass meadows and 95% of the native oyster population.Added to this, many people in coastal regions are enduring economic hardship.

He said there had been some progress in combatting the multiple threats to the coastal environment, including an initiative to restore 15% of coastal and estuarine habitats that are judged to be priority areas by 2043, but that much more needed to be done.About 1,200 hectares (2,965 acres) of salt marsh and mudflats have been created since 2005, the report found, and there has been progress on overfishing, with about half of stocks fished at sustainable levels in 2019 compared with about a tenth in 1990.Charles Clover, executive director and co-founder of the Blue Marine Foundation, said that was still far from good enough. \u201cThe ocean faces numerous threats, and this report highlights that one of the largest is simply removing far too many fish from the sea \u2013 collapsing stocks and preventing recovery. The report also stresses the important role that the seabed can have in storing carbon, yet in the UK trawling is allowed in most of our so called protected areas.\u201dRebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, called for urgent action and stricter regulation. \u201cOur seas are facing a perfect storm of rising temperatures, sewage discharges, plastic and chemical pollution and destructive industrial fishing.

        "text": "A fashion industry push to reduce the environmental impact of the clothing it sells is being undermined by an ongoing addiction to buying new clothes, with the average Briton buying 28 items every year.Asos and Primark are among the big names signed up to Wrap\u2019s voluntary environmental pact, Textiles 2030.While the companies involved have managed to reduce both the carbon intensity and volume of water per tonne used in their clothing manufacture, in its annual progress report, published today, the climate action NGO warns of hard-won gains being \u201ccancelled out\u201d because clothing production is \u201cspiralling upwards\u201d.Textiles and fashion are responsible for up to 10% of global carbon emissions. Catherine David, Wrap\u2019s director of behaviour change and business programmes, said the progress made by 130 brands and retailers involved showed \u201cit\u2019s possible to change this\u201d. But that at the moment, \u201cas fast as positive improvements happen, they\u2019re cancelled out by rising production\u201d.The companies had reduced the carbon impact of their textiles by 12% and water by 4% (on a per-tonne basis) between 2019 and 2022. However, this was negated by a 13% increase in the volume of textiles produced and sold, according to the report. The increased production rates meant overall water use actually rose by 8% over the period, while the carbon reduction figure stood at just 2%.Since production is obviously related to consumption, David said consumers had a part to play. \u201cWe\u2019re working with companies to improve clothes, but the other part of the equation is our role as shoppers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe buy more clothes than any other nation in Europe.\u201cOur research shows that a quarter of most wardrobes go unworn in a year and nearly a quarter of us admit to wearing clothes only a few times,\u201d she continued. \u201cMoving into winter is the perfect time to look through our wardrobes \u2013 wear what we have and consider whether it\u2019s time to let something go. You can donate, sell or give clothes away \u2013 it all helps them move around the economy and reduce the amount produced.\u201dWrap wants businesses to design clothes for a longer life, with good durability and recyclability and more recycled content. On a positive note, the report revealed that increased use of recycled polyester and polyamide had helped reduce the amount of fabric made from virgin materials. Also nearly three-quarters of cotton used by signatories now comes from improved sources such as the Better Cotton Initiative.With more brands and retailers operating take-back schemes, the volume of used textiles collected and sold for reuse or recycling between 2019 and 2022 had doubled, it said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Taking a numerical approach to the natural world \u2013 as in Simon Barnes\u2019s History of the World in 100 Plants, for example \u2013 is a handy way to carve off a manageable slice from a potential plethora of examples. There are, for instance, nearly 10,000 bird species worldwide. In his new book, naturalist Stephen Moss wisely chooses just 10, but in doing so tells the story of the long relationship between birds and humanity \u2013 and it has mostly been a disastrous one.Egrets, for instance, were hunted almost to extinction for their snow-white feathers, or aigrettes, which became the accessory of choice for wealthy women. During the first three months of 1885, 750,000 skins of little and snowy egrets were auctioned in London. In China, Mao Tse-Tung ordered the mass extermination of sparrows as part of a campaign against the Four Pests (the other targets were rats, flies and mosquitos). Some 1bn birds were slaughtered \u2013 one boy became a national hero for single-handedly strangling 20,000 sparrows with his bare hands. This led to their near extinction and contributed indirectly to the Great Famine that killed between 15 and 55 million people, since the sparrows were no longer available to prey on the insects that ruined crops.Egrets were not the only species that earned human beings huge profits. In one fascinating chapter, Moss tells the story of the Guanay cormorant and the astronomical sums made from their nitrogen- and phosphate-rich poop \u2013 or brown gold, as it was called. Between 1840 and 1879, at today\u2019s values, an estimated \u00a36.1 to \u00a39.1bn worth of guano in today\u2019s money was shipped from Peru. Thousands of indentured workers died in terrible conditions harvesting it.Moss is also a companionable narrator, often mixing personal recollections into the science and natural historyThe book is packed with remarkable facts and figures like this. But Moss is also a companionable narrator, often mixing personal recollections into the science and natural history, such as his trip as a boy to the Tower of London with his mother, where he first saw the ravens, which have been associated with the site since medieval times. He later returned to meet Christopher Skaife, the official ravenmaster at the Tower.The chapter on ravens \u2013 which match great apes in their ability to perform complex tasks and Moss rates as \u201cmore inspiring than any other species on the planet\u201d \u2013 is one of the best in the book. There is also a remarkable section on Darwin\u2019s finches. I approached this with an incipient yawn, thinking I had heard it all before. But Moss turns the story on its head, showing that the story of the Gal\u00e1pagos finches\u2019 seminal role in Darwin\u2019s Theory of Evolution is, in fact, a myth. Indeed, it was only much later that naturalists Peter and Rosemary Grant, who spent years studying the colony of finches on the island of Daphne Major, showed how natural selection took place among finches in real time, and at speed.Flowing like an underground stream beneath the entire book is arguably the greatest manmade threat that birds now face: the climate crisis. The melting of sea ice in Antarctica means that the breeding cycle of emperor penguins is being disrupted, with the result that penguin chicks are put at risk of drowning. The food sources on which they depend are also dwindling. Many other bird species are threatened. \u201cWhen we mess with nature,\u201d says Moss, \u201cwe do so at our peril: the emperors may go extinct first, but they foretell our own, not-so-distant, future.\u201d Ten Birds That Changed the World is published by Faber (\u00a316.99).

Photograph: Vicky NallThe plants had been absent from the lowland raised peat bog for a century after it was drained to be managed for game bird shooting.The region has lost 98% of its lowland peatland, much of it converted to farmland, causing the peat to desiccate and release large quantities of carbon dioxide.Over the last decade, however, Winmarleigh has been restored by the trust to support rare wildlife and sequester carbon. Peat banks hold water on the site, allowing bog cranberry and spongy sphagnum moss to regrow and fauna including the common lizard and the large heath butterfly to flourish.With \u00a330,000 of funding from the Lancashire Environmental Fund, Whitecroft Lighting and Natural England, the trust has brought back missing plant species, including the sundews, alongside bog asphodel and white beak-sedge.The delicate white flowers of white beak-sedge are a vital nectar source for the rare large heath, whose fortunes had declined with the widespread draining of wetland.The restoration should aid large heath butterflies, whose population had dwindled after the draining of peatland.

Included is the Canada warbler, which has never been seen before in the UK. Meanwhile, the bay-breasted warbler had only its second-ever UK sighting, and the magnolia warbler its third. All were spotted in Pembrokeshire, which got the lion\u2019s share of activity.The Chester-based birder Toby Phelps, who was the first to spot the Canada warbler and magnolia warber, posted on X: \u201cI am still in total shock from last week, these are by far the most incredible experiences I have ever had birding.\u201dThe birds\u2019 arrival was \u201ca bittersweet phenomenon\u201d, Lees said. \u201cIncredibly exciting for birders \u2026 but sad knowing that these are the fortunate few as most of the migrants displaced by the storms will have drowned at sea.\u201dA bay-breasted warbler seen at Ramsey Island.Strong, early, autumn storms make birds more likely to come over, research has suggested. \u201cClimate models indicate that the frequency of severe storms in the Atlantic will increase as temperatures rise and this may have significant negative impacts on North American bird populations,\u201d Lees said.The crowd goes wild: FC Barcelona reveals Camp Nou stadium\u2019s animal inhabitantsRead moreIt is unlikely these songbirds will be able to fly back across the Atlantic.

The episode, Saving Our Wild Isles, focuses on the threats facing British wildlife and those fighting to save it.Rumours had abounded that the BBC dared not broadcast this final episode on television because it was too hard-hitting, with some suggesting it was too critical of government action or inaction. I braced myself, expecting images of rivers polluted with plastics, sewage and pesticides, tales of dwindling numbers of insects, birds and mammals, of ancient woodlands destroyed, overfished seas, mature urban trees felled, meadows ploughed, raptors such as golden eagles poisoned, the climate crisis running amok.I need not have worried. Although there was passing mention of some awfully depressing statistics, the film is deliberately uplifting and overwhelmingly positive. It focuses on heartwarming projects that are restoring nature, from the London docklands to the arable fields of East Anglia, and north to the wilds of Cairngorm. These examples show that people benefit from and need nature, and that we can all get involved in protecting it.I recommend that you watch it, but I worry.We face an existential crisis. Those of us who have been on this planet for half a century or more have lived through the greatest loss of wildlife on our planet for 65m years, since a meteor wiped out the dinosaurs. Climate breakdown is accelerating. Our civilisation, our children\u2019s health and wellbeing, and the future of much of the life that remains on our planet, hangs in the balance.For at least 30 years it has been painfully obvious that we are heading for disaster, yet our response has been woefully inadequate. Successive governments have abjectly failed to grasp the importance of the threat we face. There have always been wonderful people swimming against the tide, defending the environment, but they are far too few.A female mason bee carries a dried grass stalk back to her snail-shell nest in Wild Isles. Photograph: John Walters/Silverback Films/BBC/PAWatching Saving Our Wild Isles, you might imagine that the tide is finally turning. It isn\u2019t.Recently, our government ignored the advice of its own scientific committee and granted a derogation allowing sugar beet farmers to use a banned neonicotinoid pesticide. Just last month it pushed back proposed bans on horticultural use of peat \u2013 a vital store of carbon that is extracted from a rare and biodiverse habitat \u2013 until 2030. Much needed reintroductions of missing species such as beavers are blocked or delayed.The new farming subsidy known as environmental land management schemes (ELMs), which seemed quite promising when first announced, has been stalled, watered-down and botched in implementation such that most farmers have been left feeling bewildered and unsupported. Oil and gas exploration are being encouraged, and a new coalmine opened. Raw sewage is being dumped into England\u2019s rivers on average 800 times a day. Environmental legislation inherited from Europe is being torched. Without support from government, the actions of a few individuals fighting for nature will never be enough.Environmentalists have been saying \u201cit is not yet too late\u201d for a long time. In reality it is already too late to avoid much worse damage than we have already seen, and whatever we do now the climate crisis will continue to worsen.Saving Our Wild Isles is charming, and perhaps it will inspire a few more people to do more for nature, but I was hoping for something different, something that might really wake us up to the dismal state of our country.David Attenborough is a hero to many of us, and no one has done more to champion the wonders of our natural world. Perhaps he might yet persuade the BBC to commission the hard-hitting, kick-up-the-arse documentary we really need.\nDave Goulson is a professor of biology at the University of Sussex, where he specialises in bee ecology\n",

        "text": "Warm winter days do not instinctively feel like an extreme weather event. Unlike the freezing bomb cyclone endured by the US at Christmas, or the floods that swept through the Philippines, they are unlikely to cause immediate widespread death and devastation. At a time when soaring energy costs have pushed so many into poverty, many will have welcomed the warmth that has been felt across Europe, especially the millions in Ukraine suffering due to Russia\u2019s attacks on its power infrastructure.Yet the heatwave should alarm us all. Though it may have been less punitive to experience than last summer\u2019s record temperatures, which led to thousands of deaths, it has spread across many more countries. \u201cWe can regard this as the most extreme event in European history,\u201d said one climatologist. Poland, where the average January temperature is around 1C, saw the thermometer climb to 19C on New Year\u2019s Day. At least seven more European countries have seen record highs. Ski resorts closed slopes or resorted to artificial snow. Though the weather might seem mild, it is disrupting crops and wildlife, and of course sudden thaws can lead to avalanches or floods.Natural variations in weather demand caution when attributing individual events. But the pattern is unmistakable: rising temperatures and extreme weather events intensified by human-made global heating. On Thursday, the Met Office confirmed that 2022 was Britain\u2019s hottest year on record, with the annual average temperature passing 10C for the first time \u2013 and the heat made 160 times more likely by the climate crisis. Nasa says that the last decade saw eight of the 10 warmest years since modern records began in the 1880s. A shift that was previously clear in data is now viscerally confronting people who may previously have been largely indifferent to the risks. Lines on a graph are easier to ignore than trees flowering in the wrong season, flash floods and unbearable heat or cold.Ten years ago, it would have seemed outlandish to talk of the kind of temperatures and extreme weather now witnessed regularly. Frighteningly, all this is happening with a rise of just 1.1C above pre-industrial temperatures. Yet 2022 set other records too: renewables are performing far beyond predictions. A new wind power record was set last May, with the UK producing enough to cover half its electricity needs. Technological improvements and economies of scale have brought down the price of generation as fossil fuel prices have soared.The government now needs to turn its emissions targets into action. So far, it has been lamentably slow in doing so and in some cases \u2013 such as in offering approval for a new Cumbrian coalmine \u2013 is actually going in the wrong direction. It should be smoothing the path for renewable firms and investors. The Oxford Farming Conference currently in progress offers an important chance to drive down the substantial emissions resulting from farming and food production; ministers show no signs of seizing it. There is no real transport strategy; the government is refusing to release the emissions figures behind its decarbonisation plan. It needs to prioritise insulation and other measures to cut domestic emissions. Economics and traditional national security concerns now point in the same direction as environmental protection \u2013 there is no excuse for delaying further. The door is closing fast, but there is still a way out. The UK, and other nations, must take it while they can.",

A similar decision was taken in July, when plans to pilot hydrogen in Whitby, Cheshire, were scrapped after local opposition.Some residents raised concerns that they were at risk of becoming unwilling \u201clab rats\u201d for a technology that would never take off in the UK.The government is due to make a decision about whether its net zero climate plans will include replacing household gas with hydrogen by 2026. It will assess evidence from a pilot in Fife in Scotland, and similar schemes in Europe.Many experts, including the government\u2019s infrastructure tsars, believe that most households should switch to electric heating options, such as heat pumps, while hydrogen is used in heavy industry.On Wednesday, the UK government formally backed plans to ban gas and \u201chydrogen-ready\u201d boilers from new-build homes in England from 2025.Claire Coutinho, the energy security secretary, said: \u201cHydrogen presents a massive economic opportunity for the UK, unlocking over 12,000 jobs and up to \u00a311bn of investment by 2030.\u201dThe government said on Thursday it would back 11 new projects that planned to make \u201cgreen hydrogen\u201d, which is produced by splitting water molecules with renewable electricity.

        "text": "Local governments in China approved more new coal power in the first three months of 2023 than in the whole of 2021, according to official documents.The approvals, analysed by Greenpeace, reveal that between January and March this year, at least 20.45 gigawatts of coal power was approved, up from 8.63GW in the same period in 2022. In the whole of 2021, 18GW of coal was approved.A Chinese Communist party (CCP) five-year plan from 2016 had placed a heavy emphasis on reducing the use of coal and developing clean energy sources. In 2020 Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, pledged that the country would become carbon neutral by 2060.This prompted an era of reduced coal power approvals as local governments sought to keep their local economies in check with Beijing\u2019s priorities. A rise in coal power approvals came in 2020 when the five-year plan came to an end, as local governments anticipated even tighter restrictions on coal expansion in the next round.But in 2021, China suffered huge power outages, leading to a dramatic shift in the CCP\u2019s energy priorities. In September the price of electricity soared as factories reopened to service global demand as the rest of the world emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. But the government had capped prices, so many power plants reduced output rather than operated at a loss.China relies on coal for more than half of its energy consumption. As homes in the colder north of the country faced the prospect of a gruelling winter without heat, the government\u2019s rhetoric shifted from reducing coal to prioritising energy security. That resulted in a \u201cmyth that if you build more power plants, that will bring more energy security,\u201d said Xie Wenwen, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace.The war in Ukraine, which sent global energy prices soaring, was \u201canother huge event that fuelled the energy security narrative\u201d.Chinese coal approvals Campaigners argue that in order to meet China\u2019s growing energy needs, it is not more coal that is needed, but a more flexible grid. A report published this month by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, noted that technologies for storing clean energy \u201care not yet mature enough to be deployed at the scale considered essential\u201d for China\u2019s plans to expand the use of renewable energy.More than 75% of China\u2019s coal, wind, solar and hydro resources are in the west of the country, while more than 70% of power consumption happens in central and eastern China. Five provinces on the east coast account for nearly two-fifths of China\u2019s total consumption. Policymakers have yet to find a solution for efficiently rebalancing this problem.Still, in the 14th five-year plan, which covers the period until 2025, the government said that more than half of increased energy demands in that period should be covered by renewables. Between 2010 and 2021, renewable generation increased by an average annual rate of 19.2%, primarily from wind and solar power.But last year Xi said that coal would remain a mainstay of China\u2019s energy mix that \u201cwould be hard to change in the short term\u201d.",

The animals \u2013 young peregrine falcons - were measured, weighed and fitted with bright identification rings.A few feathers flew, the falcons nibbled at their handlers but no harm was done to birds or humans and within minutes they were back outside in their nest.The cathedral peregrines, which nest on the balcony of the south tower, became an internet hit during Covid thanks to a carefully placed webcam and continue to be a huge springtime draw for the great Wiltshire church.The young falcons already have fearsome beaks and talons. Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty ImagesBut the project is also seen as increasingly important by conservationists because the birds are regarded as being under threat from a diverse range of dangers including unscrupulous gamekeepers, pigeon fanciers and falconers who would love to get their hands on a young juvenile British bird \u2013 and avian flu.\u201cThere\u2019s been a resurgence in peregrine numbers,\u201d said Nigel Jones, from the British Trust for Ornithology, who carried out the ringing. \u201cBut they do face multiple threats. It\u2019s likely the population will fall again. This is one way of keeping an eye on them.\u201dThe operation on Wednesday began with a twisty climb up 332 steps through the bell chamber to the landing known as eight doors, 68 metres above ground level. Above is the interior of the 123-metre high spire and a spider\u2019s web network of medieval scaffolding.Granville Pictor, a peregrine expert from Wiltshire Ornithological Society, was sent out to gently encourage the adult birds away and the three chicks \u2013 two females, one male \u2013 were carried to a table set up beneath the spire.Phil Sheldrake, the cathedral\u2019s nature conservation adviser, held the birds while Jones wielded a pair of pliers to ring the birds.\u201cActually, the bigger birds of prey such as goshawks and peregrines are easier to handle,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThey tend to be quite docile. It\u2019s the smaller ones such as kestrels and hobbies that squirm and have tiny sharp talons \u2013 they are horrible to handle. The peregrine chicks haven\u2019t sussed they could do you real damage.\u201dOne of the chicks being ringed by Nigel Jones, helped by the cathedral\u2019s Phil Sheldrake.

As the New South Wales cities minister, Rob Stokes, said at the cove\u2019s official opening (when he enthusiastically took a dip fully clothed), the new swim spot is thanks to efforts to recover waterways from pollution and its industrial past, but also thanks to a push to increase access to public places to swim.A swimming spot in Pyrmont \u2013 once lined with abattoirs and factories \u2013 is likely to open next summer.

Paddocked with sheep, they will kick and chase dogs and foxes that get too close to the lambs.There were 350,000 alpacas in Australia in 2021, according to a report by Agrifutures Australia, and, after a baby boom fuelled by ideal breeding conditions, the herd is on track to reach 400,000.Amee Dennis, who has 110 alpacas at her family farm in the central west of New South Wales, is among those who see the animals as a secondary income source. \u201cWe got our first alpacas close to five years ago, purely as guards for lambs,\u201d Dennis said.\u201cWe did not know a single thing about an alpaca but we figured it [had] to be easier than sitting out every night with a spotlight trying to deal with the problem that way.\u201d\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nNow Dennis uses the alpaca fleeces to make fibre art.

Visitors can also sponsor an animal.But most of their income comes from selling the fibre. \u201cEven though the tourism side of our business has absolutely been growing and we\u2019ve worked really hard to do that over the last couple of years, where we started was products and fibre, and that\u2019s still where our main income comes from as far as the alpacas are concerned.\u201dView image in fullscreenAlpaca farmer Amee Dennis and Sugar the baby alpaca in Tomingley, central west NSW. Photograph: Nicole Drew/Quinton Park AlpacasMost alpaca farms make their money from fibre. About 250,000 alpacas are used to produce fibre for sale, the Agrifutures report said, with each yielding about 5kg a year, suggesting an annual farmgate value of about $13.5m. The industry is worth $19.5m.The report added that the farmgate value had the potential to double if there was improved grower education and awareness of fibre market needs. But with most alpaca farmers being hobbyists or using their herd as a secondary income, it warned that growth may be slow.Lee Sadler, the vice-president of the Australian Alpaca Association, said most of their members had only modest herds of alpaca, and were not drawing a full-time income. \u201c[Full-time alpaca farmers] are in the tens, not in the hundreds,\u201d she said.\u201cThey have sufficient land, sufficient land holdings and sufficient numbers of alpacas to make a very successful enterprise.

The one I see is a common or viviparous lizard (Zootoca vivipara), so called because the females incubate their eggs inside their bodies, rather than laying them in shells to hatch later. During the summer, as their flanks grow wide, they will spend long periods basking in the sun to aid development of the brood within. In July and August they give birth, producing up to 11 young encased in transparent membranes, which split open immediately.Blackish at first, the juveniles turn bronze-brown and then develop a beaded pattern of spots and stripes. Colours vary through yellow, browns and greens, with some remaining wholly black. While no individual is the same, females tend to be stripier and males spottier.This specimen has an olive back with darker stripes, but I cannot be sure of its sex without seeing its underside. Males have distinctive yellowy-orange mottled bellies, which are even brighter than usual this month because they have sloughed their old skins in preparation for the mating season. Courtship is brief \u2013 females seek out mates, which seize them in their jaws, usually within seconds of meeting. Females refuse an undesirable male by biting back fiercely and running away.Swiftness and violence are part of these creatures\u2019 hunting strategy, albeit on a micro scale. They eat small insects, spiders and earthworms, which they grab and shake to stun before crunching along the length and swallowing whole, often headfirst.Despite this seeming aggression, they are a relatively social and peaceable species.

If this does not happen, the process will need to begin again.Steve Reed, the shadow environmental secretary, said: \u201cHunting endangered animals is barbaric and must be confined to history. We must stop the selfish trophy hunters who want to slaughter then display endangered animals\u2019 body parts for their own perverse self-gratification.\u201cThe Conservative government must stop siding with these killers.

The cynical tactics employed by a small minority of unelected peers with clear hunting interests, in spite of the proposed legislation enjoying overwhelming support from both the public and our elected MPs, reflects badly on the parliamentary.\u201cWe will continue to call on the current and any future UK government to introduce a ban on trophy imports.

        "text": "Public land ownership in Britain is in crisis. Since the late 1970s, when the government began what has turned into a long-term land privatisation programme, about half of all public land \u2013 2 million hectares in total, or 10% of Britain\u2019s overall land area \u2013 has been sold, mainly to private companies.Local authority and NHS landholdings have been particularly hard hit. Today, local government owns only about 40% as much land as it did four decades ago. The NHS estate has been even more radically depleted, shrinking by around 70%. And the pace of privatisation is accelerating. Both NHS trusts and local authorities are feverishly selling off the few property assets that remain to them as they struggle to make ends meet in the face of swingeing budget cuts imposed by Whitehall.If the sell-off continues, there could be no public land left by mid-century. The NHS and many councils could be landless long before that.Does it matter if the public sector is left without land of its own? Clearly, the government thinks not.The left\u2019s stock response to privatisation has traditionally been to contest or refute the principal logic driving it, which is that assets are utilised more efficiently in private than public hands.But this criticism misses the mark where land privatisation is concerned. Land is different. The biggest problem with land privatisation is not that the private sector is not necessarily a more efficient landowner and user. It is that when land moves from public to private ownership, some socially important land uses simply disappear. Why? The crux of the matter is what economists call market failure, a situation where the private sector fails to offer something even though there is demand for it, usually because it is not profitable for it to do so.This is what has happened as British land has been privatised. Various important demands on the land have increasingly gone unmet, because public bodies now lack the land to meet them and private-sector bodies lack the incentive. Here are some examples of things that, bit by bit, are disappearing from national and local maps: free public parks; genuinely affordable housing; entry\u2011level farm tenancies; state-school playing fields; public space where behaviour is not surveilled and circumscribed; free long-term residential healthcare; and allotments.\u2018Today, golf courses cover 10 times more land than local authority allotments.\u2019 Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianInstead, the private sector has used the land it has acquired to provide things that can be made to pay, such as shopping centres, private parks (and car parks), wildlife \u201cexperiences\u201d, upmarket \u2013 and often gated \u2013 housing.If there is one statistic that epitomises this shift better than any other, it is that, today, golf courses across the UK cover 10 times more land than local authority allotments (for which around 90,000 people are queueing, with some expected to wait as long as 40 years for a plot). This, if you like, is \u201cefficient\u201d private-sector land use in action. The average rental price of an allotment is only around \u00a340 for a whole year. That, if you\u2019re lucky, gets you one round of golf.What is the answer? One is to simply stop the sell-off. If further public land is to be sold, conditions should be attached to the sale. Rather than selling land and merely hoping that the private sector uses it in socially beneficial ways, public bodies could insist that they do so. And then, of course, seemingly most radically, there is the option of reversing course. The government could buy land back, to use it for those things that the private sector is failing to do. With talk of possibly reforming laws to enable councils to compulsorily purchase land at discounted rates, perhaps this is not such a radical option after all.

The party has already committed to a range of climate policies including decarbonising electricity production by 2030, a halt to any new oil and gas licences in the North Sea and the creation of a national publicly owned energy company, GB Energy, run on clean UK power.But Tim Hickish, an organiser with Green New Deal Rising, said that while these moves were welcome, the party had to go further. \u201cWe want to see ourselves in the vision politicians are setting out and we want a reason to vote in the next election for a party that truly addresses our concerns and stands up for us as our generation faces up to the future challenges we will have to tackle. We want to know, Labour: are you on our side or are you on the side of the billionaires and fossil fuel giants?\u201dGreen New Deal Rising, which claimed some credit for persuading Labour to adopt its current set of environmental policies, has commissioned polling that shows 75% of those who voted for Labour in the last election want to see more action on the climate crisis.Its call for the party to go further has won widespread support from other youth and climate groups, including the UK Youth Climate Coalition and the National Union of Students (NUS).skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Avian flu has devastated seabird colonies at sites across England, Wales and Northern Ireland this year, the National Trust said, as it called on the government to coordinate detailed and long-term monitoring of the crisis.It said more than 7,000 seabirds had died of the disease at five of its sites in 2023. Only one of its sites was affected in 2022.\u201cIt is absolutely devastating for these birds,\u201d said Ben McCarthy, the trust\u2019s head of nature conservation and restoration ecology. \u201cIt is really tough for the rangers. It is upsetting to see so much death around you.He said that on the Farne Islands in Northumberland, \u201cquite literally a herring gull fell out of the sky beside me\u201d.\u201cIt is an extraordinary experience, really quite devastating, to see the scale of the mortality,\u201d he said.McCarthy said avian flu had added to the extreme pressure seabirds were already under because of climate change.Government action on the disease was necessary, he said, but it had to be part of a bigger picture. \u201cWe do need the government to take bolder, stronger and more urgent action around the existential challenges of things like climate change and the nature crisis,\u201d he said.\u201cVery detailed and long-term monitoring\u201d of avian flu needed to be coordinated by the government and its agencies, he said.The government had got off to a \u201cbit of a slow start\u201d, he said. \u201cBut we are now getting in sync with each other \u2026 My concern is that the effort is sustained.\u201dChartMcCarthy said the trust had released bleak, \u201cvery depressing\u201d figures for its sites.At Long Nanny in Northumberland, home to Britain\u2019s largest mainland colony of Arctic terns, James Porteus, an area ranger, said it was \u201cabsolutely heartbreaking\u201d to see so many birds die.Rangers began seeing signs of the disease in late June and have collected 1,066 dead Arctic tern chicks (roughly 40% of the population) and 263 adults (at least 8%).\u201cThis year\u2019s losses could take years to recover from,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s before we consider how this indiscriminate disease might impact the colony once again next year.\u201dAt the Farne Islands there were fewer dead birds than last year (down 39%), which Harriet Reid, also an area ranger, said was partly down to regular pick-ups.\u201cRemoving the seabirds as soon as we find them does seem to have made a difference,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we do need to rapidly understand what more we can do to protect these precious seabirds.\u201dLast year, guillemots and kittiwakes were most affected, she said.

At Brownsea Island in Dorset, 650 Black-headed gulls, Common terns and Sandwich terns died with the vast majority being chicks or juveniles.In Northern Ireland, rangers collected 21 dead Common terns from Cockle Island, a breeding colony just off the coast, and more birds washed up at Cushendun, White Park Bay and Runkerry over the summer.A glimmer of good news comes from Blakeney Point on the north coast of Norfolk, home to an important breeding colony of Little terns.It appears to have escaped the disease with it being a \u2018\u201cgood\u201d year for a seabird that had previously been struggling due to foxes, rats and birds of prey as well as disturbance from people and dogs, the trust said.Christine Middlemiss, the UK\u2019s chief veterinary officer, said: \u201cWe recognise that the current outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza poses a significant threat to the UK\u2019s wild bird populations and share the concerns about the impact on breeding populations, particularly seabirds that nest closely in large numbers.\u201cDealing with disease in wild animals that are frequently on the move is extremely difficult globally but we have been working very closely with partners on this issue since the impacts on wild birds started to become apparent and we keep the outbreak in these populations under close review.\u201d",

        "text": "The Biden administration has advanced a $8bn drilling project on Alaska\u2019s north slope. The ConocoPhillips Willow project, which would be one of the largest oil and gas developments on federal territory, has drawn fierce opposition from environmentalists, who say its approval runs counter to the president\u2019s ambitious climate goals.An environmental assessment released by the interior department on Wednesday recommends a scaled-back version of the project ConocoPhillips originally proposed, and would produce about 600m barrels of oil over 30 years, with a peak of 180,000 barrels of crude oil a day.EPA vetoes Alaska mine to protect salmon in win for environmentalistsRead moreEnvironmental groups and the Native village of Nuiqsut, which would be most affected by the project in the northernmost stretch of Alaska, have opposed the project, which they say would mark the end of a way of life for communities in the rapidly warming Arctic. It would also exacerbate air pollution problems in a region where oil and gas extraction projects are already contributing to elevated rates of asthma and other health conditions.\u201cWillow is a carbon bomb that cannot be allowed to explode in the Arctic,\u201d said Karlin Nageak Itchoak, senior regional director at the non-profit Wilderness Society. Already, the Arctic has been warming almost four times faster than the rest of the world.\u201cOur Native villages are eroding into the sea, thawing permafrost is making infrastructure insecure, and food sources are disappearing,\u201d Itchoak said. \u201cAnd this project would just exacerbate and speed up the climate crisis in the Arctic.\u201dThe environmental review is a final step toward approval and comes after a years-long dispute between ConocoPhillips and the government over the corporation\u2019s right to drill on federal territory in the Arctic. Willow would be located inside the 23m-acre (93m-hectare) National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, which is the largest tract of undisturbed public land in the United States.After the project was first approved by the Trump administration, a federal judge reversed the decision, ruling that the environmental review was flawed.This latest review released by the Bureau of Land Management suggests that a scaled-down Willow project would minimize the impact on vulnerable species including polar bears, yellow-billed loons and caribou, while remaining in line with the minimum ConocoPhillips has said it needs to drill to make the project profitable.But the interior department did leave open the possibility of further scaling back or rejecting the project, with a final decision expected in a month.Officials have \u201csubstantial concerns\u201d about even the scaled-back plan\u2019s impact on wildlife and Alaska Native communities, the department noted in a separate statement.\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that Biden seems ready to greenlight the massively destructive Willow project, prioritizing oil industry profits over the future of polar bears and other Arctic wildlife,\u201d said Kristen Monsell, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep fighting it until it\u2019s scrapped.\u201dBiden had promised during his election campaign to end federal oil and gas drilling, and transition toward renewable energy. But as oil prices rise as a consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the president has faced further pressure to increase drilling.Alaska\u2019s two Republican senators and the state\u2019s sole congressional representative, a Democrat, have urged the administration to approve the project, which the say would boost the state\u2019s economy. Some Alaska Native tribal governments organizations, including the Inupiat Community of the Arctic Slope and the Alaska Federation of Natives, have supported the project for similar reasons.But environmental groups and tribes including those in Nuiqsut have countered that any jobs and money the project brings in the short term will be negated by the environmental devastation it will cause in the long run.Already, Arctic communities are at the front line of global climate chaos. In December, the city of Utqiagvik, at Alaska\u2019s northern edge, reached its warmest temperature ever observed. Elsewhere in Alaska, a record-breaking 2022 wildfire season and coastal flooding and powerful storms displaced communities along the western coast.Increased oil and gas extraction in the region has already affected caribou populations, which several communities the area hunt for subsistence.\u201cThis project could be a turning point for not just Alaska and the Arctic, but for the entire world,\u201d said Siqi\u00f1iq Maupin, director for the Sovereign Inupiat for a Living Arctic, a group that opposes Willow. \u201cIt is going to possibly bring us to a place where we can\u2019t come back from.\u201d",

But shortly afterwards, he found himself feeling weary. \u201cI thought, things can only go downhill from here.\u201d Frith knew he needed to do something else \u2013 but what?A few years earlier he had bought his childhood home, which his mother had still been renting, and moved in with his wife, Emma, and two children for the final months of his mother\u2019s life. The house, in Gloucestershire, looks out over the Severn vale.As a boy, he loved to sketch birds. \u201cI was one of five sons to a single mum. We ran wild in the countryside and played like animals in the hedgerows.\u201dThe return to his childhood home stirred some unacknowledged yearning in him, because while Frith wondered aloud about a second career in landscape gardening, he heard a different internal voice. \u201cThat child who used to love drawing whispered to me down the years,\u201d he says.Frith bought pencils and began to sketch \u2013 mostly friends\u2019 children. It was the first time he had drawn since childhood. At art school, which he attended before film school, he was a conceptual artist, and drawing was \u201cfrowned upon as regressive\u201d.Frith had an idea. There was a great oak tree at Nibley Green, a couple of fields from home. It had stood out to his young self as a \u201cfantastical giant \u2013 a treasure trove, home to jackdaws, foxes, a barn owl, beetles, bats. It was a cave inside. We used to squeeze in through this hole.\u201d He decided he would lock himself away for two months to draw it in all its glorious detail.Frith drew \u201cevery twig and every bud\u201d on a large sheet of paper, 150cm by 130cm. \u201cWhile I was drawing,\u201d he says, \u201cthere came moments when it was as though the tree was drawing itself. I could feel the tree, I could smell the bark. I had spent so much time playing in that tree, it was deep inside me. And it emerged in this drawing.\u201dHis finished oak held \u201ca real power\u201d, he says. \u201cAs you walk towards it, it just grows. The detail emerges.\u201dA friend suggested he approach Felix Dennis, arts patron and lover of trees. \u201cI found out he was doing a poetry reading in Stratford-on-Avon,\u201d Frith says. \u201cI staggered into his dressing room with this great big drawing, plonked it down in front of him and said: \u2018Mr Dennis, I want to draw these oak trees.\u2019 I knew the tree would talk. \u2018Right,\u2019 he said, \u2018You better come and see me.\u2019\u201dFelix Dennis in 2006. Photograph: Karen Robinson/The ObserverAt lunch a few weeks later, they talked for hours, drank three bottles of wine, and finally Dennis wrote a contract on a piece of paper that he rolled and stuffed inside one of the empty bottles. It was for 20 drawings of \u201cthe most important oak trees in Britain\u201d. He would pay Frith \u201cregularly and handsomely\u201d. At 60, Frith had become a tree portraitist.Over the next three winters he travelled the length and breadth of Britain and spent days with each of the trees, selected with the help of the Ancient Tree Forum, the Tree Council, the Woodland Trust and \u201cother ancient tree nuts\u201d.In 2014 \u2013 the year Dennis died \u2013 Frith completed the project. The resultant collection was exhibited at Kew in 2018, Dennis having donated half the drawings before he died.Frith has since started work on a 20-drawing series of Britain\u2019s most important ash trees. Against the backdrop of ash dieback, the project feels urgent. \u201cThese beautiful old ash trees are going to be lost to us,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are 350 years old and they are dying because of a disease that we\u2019ve spread.\u201dDrawing is not only an act of care and a demand for preservation, but it \u201cgives me that interface between my passion for the natural world and my creativity,\u201d Frith says. It has also given him a different perspective on the passage of time. \u201cI\u2019m an old man yet I\u2019m only 71, and some of the trees I\u2019ve drawn are 1,000 years old. When I\u2019m with them and when I draw them, I think about my mortality and the brief nature of human life that passes fleetingly beneath them.\u201d\nTell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?\n",

        "text": "A list of the 20 costliest climate disasters of 2023 has revealed a \u201cglobal postcode lottery stacked against the poor\u201d, according to an analysis.The research by the charity Christian Aid found that devastating wildfires and floods are hitting those who can least afford to rebuild, and the countries that have contributed least to the climate crisis by burning far fewer fossil fuels than wealthy nations, which have faced fewer climate disasters.The cost ranges from more than $4,000 (\u00a33,155) per person due to a wildfire in Hawaiito $9 (\u00a37) per person due to flooding in Peru.The research examined 20 natural disasters exacerbated by climate breakdown that hit 14 countries over the past year. The highest per capita cost was the wildfires in Hawaii in August, which far outstrips the second costliest, which was Guam\u2019s storms in May, at a cost of nearly $1,500 (\u00a31,182) per person.The analysis published on Wednesday highlights that countries with worse infrastructure and flimsier homes face larger costs after a climate disaster as their inhabited areas are more easily destroyed. In the areas where people have faced the highest costs, many are employed in agriculture, which is vulnerable to extreme weather, and the government is less likely to invest in prevention or rebuilding.Patrick Watt, the chief executive of Christian Aid, said: \u201cWhen it comes to the climate crisis, there is a global postcode lottery that is stacked against the poor. In poorer countries, people are often less prepared for climate-related disasters and have fewer resources with which to bounce back. The upshot is that more people die, and recovery is slower and more unequal. There is a double injustice in the fact that the communities worst affected by global warming have contributed little to the problem.\u201cGovernments urgently need to take further action at home and internationally, to cut emissions, and adapt to the effects of climate change. And where the impacts go beyond what people can adapt to, the loss and damage fund must be resourced to compensate the poorest countries for the effects of a crisis that isn\u2019t of their making.\u201dLoss and damage, which refers to payments from wealthier, more polluting countries to those who emit fewer fossil fuels but bear the brunt of climate breakdown, has become part of climate negotiations in recent years. Developing countries have demanded climate justice after facing disasters that have been extremely costly to fix. At the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai this year, wealthy countries most responsible for the climate emergency promised a combined total of just over $700m (\u00a3556m) to the loss and damage fund \u2013 the equivalent of less than 0.2% of the irreversible economic and non-economic losses developing countries are facing from global heating every year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The statement said: \u201cAs the secretary said, he would go when it is appropriate and wouldn\u2019t detract from the emergency response efforts. The secretary is going now that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has said it is moving out of the emergency response phase and transitioning to the long-term remediation phase.\u201dThe head of the National Transportation Safety Board \u2013 the lead agency investigating the crash \u2013 has said that the improved braking system wouldn\u2019t have applied to the train that veered off its tracks in East Palestine, but environmental groups are pushing for the Biden administration to reinstate the rule anyway.There has been pressure from some Republicans to review safety rules, with Mike DeWine, the Ohio governor, saying it is \u201cabsurd\u201d that the train could be marked as non-hazardous because it wasn\u2019t exclusively carrying toxic material. But many other GOP figures have so far shied away from calling for tighter regulation of the rail industry, instead focusing on what they say has been a ponderous response from the Biden administration.Residents have expressed distrust at official statements that the water and air in the town is safe. In his visit on Wednesday, Trump, who is running for the White House again in 2024, said the community needs \u201canswers and results\u201d, not excuses. He spoke at a firehouse roughly half a mile from where more than three dozen freight cars \u2013 including 11 carrying hazardous materials \u2013 came off the tracks near the Pennsylvania state line.\u201cIn too many cases, your goodness and perseverance were met with indifference and betrayal,\u201d Trump said. He appeared with Senator JD Vance, Mayor Trent Conaway and other state and local leaders.The former president and other Republicans have intensified criticism of the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the 3 February derailment, which led to evacuations and fears of air and water contamination after a controlled burning of toxic chemicals aboard the rail cars.The Biden White House has defended its response to the derailment, saying officials from the EPA, National Transportation Safety Board and other agencies were at the rural site within hours of the derailment. The White House says it has also offered federal assistance and that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been coordinating with the state emergency operations center and other partners.EPA administrator Michael Regan visited the site last week and earlier this week and tried to reassure skeptical residents of the town, which has a population of around 5,000, that the water was fit for drinking and the air safe to breathe.\u201cI\u2019m asking they trust the government,\u201d Regan said. \u201cI know that\u2019s hard.

The climate crisis was also a contributing factor, he said, with wet snow driving herds towards areas where there are major roads.The S\u00e1mi parliament has expressed concern about the changing conditions in the reindeer industry as a result of global heating, with rising temperatures making winter snow conditions more difficult for moving and feeding reindeer.Reindeer husbandry plays an important function in the S\u00e1mi community. Rannerud said the relationship was often on an individual basis, with some reindeer so tame that you could almost \u201cpat them on the back\u201d.He put state inaction on reindeer protection down to money, saying it was cheaper to pay the few thousand kronor cost of a dead reindeer than to build a multimillion-kronor fence.Joacim Lundqvist, a police wildlife coordinator, said it was normal to see dead reindeer on the side of the roads. He said reindeer could not survive road traffic accidents and had to be euthanised.\u201cIt\u2019s terrible. They lie there like in an animal graveyard,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some places you can see 10-15 reindeer in a short stretch of road.\u201dThe police, other authorities and S\u00e1mi villages must find solutions, he said. \u201cThe situation as it is now is escalating and unsustainable.\u201d",

The prime minister has also backed \u201cmaxing out\u201d oil and gas reserves.Speaking during the G20 summit of world leaders in India, Sunak again hinted that he wanted to limit the impact of net zero policies on consumers. \u201cNet zero done in the right way can be very beneficial for jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to make sure that the story is about. The net zero story for me shouldn\u2019t be a hair shirt story of giving everything up and your bills going up. That\u2019s not the vision of net zero that I think is the right one for the UK.\u201dThe Tory party\u2019s position on policies designed to help it achieve its goal of reaching net zero by 2050 has become increasingly fraught.The right of the party has become emboldened by the Conservatives\u2019 success at the Uxbridge byelection, where a focus on the unpopularity of London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone led to various demands to row back on green commitments that would hit voters.However, there is now a growing response from the liberal wing, which believes that abandoning the party\u2019s green credentials spells disaster and will further alienate younger voters who are already being put off by the Conservatives. At a gathering of the liberal Tory Reform Group this weekend, senior figures urged Sunak to stick to his net zero pledges.Damian Green, the former de facto deputy prime minister who chairs the One Nation group of Tory MPs, warned: \u201cThe voices wanting us to renege on our commitment to net zero by 2050 are wrong both in policy and political terms.\u201d He added: \u201cWe promised this in the 2019 manifesto and we should try to stick to our promises. It\u2019s what the public expects from a Conservative government.\u201dHe also issued a broader plea to Sunak not to shift to the right over immigration, with concerns that the prime minister may be pressured to commit to quitting the European court of human rights (ECHR) should his plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda be blocked by the courts.A party row over the ECHR is set to be one of the main subplots at the Conservative annual conference, which gathers in Manchester next month.\u201cThere are also things we need to stop,\u201d Green said. \u201cThe voices that call for us to leave the ECHR are simplistic and wrong.

If the government is going to reduce direct support for business energy bills, then perhaps the policy focus should turn to how they can offset this by using tax and investment incentives, the design of energy markets, and greater financial reward for the demand side, allowing businesses to offset financial pressures, as well as maintain their pursuit of net zero,\u201d he said.The new bills scheme will see companies get a discount on wholesale gas and electricity prices for a year instead of the current system, which caps costs.Manufacturers with heavy energy usage, such as glass and steelmakers, will get a greater discount. However, most businesses will receive just 0.7p a kilowatt hour off their gas bills and 2p a Kwh off their electricity costs.The Green party MP Caroline Lucas said: \u201cThis decision does pose an existential threat to small businesses, many of whom think that in a sense they\u2019re being left vulnerable to wholesale energy price hikes while the government washes it hands and walks away.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Dozens of advocacy groups have filed a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), claiming the federal department has failed to come up with a plan to regulate water pollution from factory farms.The suit claims the agency has yet to respond to a 2017 legal petition from more than 30 environmental groups demanding that the EPA tighten its Clean Water Act enforcement for factory farms, also known as concentrated animal feeding operations (Cafos), where thousands of animals are sometimes confined.The agency has never explained how it plans to crack down on water pollution that often contains manure, antibiotics and chemicals, the groups argue. Federal rules require government agencies to respond to petitions \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d.\u201cGiven the magnitude of the health and environmental threats, competing priorities do not justify further delay,\u201d the lawsuit argues.Livestock and poultry create about 1.4bn tons of manure a year, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Factory farms often store manure in ponds that can overflow into streams, lakes or rivers and leach into groundwater.Manure causes nitrogen and phosphorus in water, tainting drinking water and causing toxic algal blooms that can be deadly to aquatic life. Waste-polluted water can irritate skin and cause gastrointestinal and respiratory problems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The agency itself has said that three-quarters of factory farms discharge pollution, said Emily Miller, an attorney for advocacy group Food & Water Watch, the lead petitioner. But EPA has essentially let companies decide whether they want to comply with the Clean Water Act, she said.\u201cEPA has set up a catch-me-if-you-can system,\u201d Miller said. Factory farms \u201conly have to get Clean Water Act permits if they admit they discharge, which is obviously not an incentive to do so\u201d.Federal authorities have been \u201creluctant\u201d to regulate factory farms since the Clean Water Act passed in 1972, said Anthony Schutz, an associate dean and associate professor at the University of Nebraska law school. \u201cThere\u2019s a powerful agricultural lobby that doesn\u2019t support regulation,\u201d Schutz said. \u201cIt would rather see pollution abatement accomplished through voluntary actions.\u201dIf the lawsuit is successful, he said, it could lead the EPA to push states to tighten pollution enforcement or risk losing their ability to regulate agriculture.A spokesperson for the EPA said in an email that it \u201ccontinues to work collaboratively with farmers, industry stakeholders and environmental organizations\u201d. The agency added: \u201cIt is important to understand the diverse points of view and work together to implement solutions that are effective.\u201dIndustry groups say factory farms are sufficiently regulated. Ben Weinheimer, president and CEO of the Texas Cattle Feeders Association, said nearly all cattle ranchers in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico comply with federal water regulations and have the proper permits.\u201cI see phrases like \u2018weak regulations\u2019 and \u2026 \u2018inadequately protective\u2019, said Weinheimer, a Texas agricultural engineer. \u201cNone of those terms accurately describe what we have in place here \u2026 we take so much pride in how we protect the environment.\u201dBut agricultural waste has devastated waterways around the country. In Indiana farm runoff is a main driver of water pollution. A 2015 assessment found 80% of surveyed Indiana drinking water utilities reported water limitations due, in part, to farm runoff.Increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather events are exacerbating factory farms\u2019 pollution problem. Hurricane Matthew inundated dozens of North Carolina hog and chicken farms in 2016, sending animal feces into rivers and lakes. And in 2018, Hurricane Florence caused the flooding of more than 100 manure lagoons on industrial hog farms in North Carolina.In Iowa, which has thousands of hog farms, some lakes are so polluted that Julie Duhn said she\u2019s afraid to take her grandchildren swimming.\u201cThere\u2019s just so much wrong and it just feels urgent,\u201d said Duhn, a resident of Eldora, Iowa, whose written declaration was included in the lawsuit. \u201cWater is essential to life and when you can\u2019t feel comfortable drinking it, let alone swimming in it, that seems pretty urgent to me.\u201dTwo of Iowa\u2019s largest hog producers, Iowa Select Farms and Summit Agricultural Group, did not respond to interview requests.While the EPA has cracked down on pollution in other industries, factory farms have not received the same scrutiny, said Lisa Whelan, deputy director of Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, a petitioner in the lawsuit.\u201cWe want polluters to be held accountable for polluting our waterways,\u201d Whelan said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen from EPA is a free pass to pollute.\u201d",

        "text": "Estimates of the number of cars, and therefore drivers,\u00a0affected by the introduction of new emissions\u00a0rules in London next month vary. Of the capital\u2019s 2.6m registered vehicles, which belong to around half of all households, it is thought that around\u00a0one in five do not meet the new test. But given that car ownership is higher in the outer boroughs than in the affected area, some drivers of more polluting cars will neither be forced to pay the \u00a312.50 daily charge nor change their vehicles.Within the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) it is a different story. Most petrol cars registered after 2005 meet the tougher standard; most diesel ones registered\u00a0before 2015 don\u2019t. Owners of such vehicles have some cause to feel aggrieved. Driving is not inherently antisocial and has been powerfully incentivised for decades, with cheating manufacturers\u00a0to blame for a false consensus that developed around diesel\u2019s supposedly greener credentials. For families or other groups, driving is too often the cheapest and quickest way to travel \u2013 due in part to excessive rail and other transport costs. For\u00a0some people, in some circumstances, there is no other way to get around.But given the knowledge about the effects of air pollution on human health, including some evidence linking it to more severe coronavirus infections, the Ulez can only be welcomed. Under the former mayor Boris Johnson, London\u2019s air stayed filthy in spite of a growing body of research showing pollution\u2019s damaging effects. One study last year found that London was the worst city in Europe for health costs associated with air pollution, while a coroner ruled that it contributed to the death of a nine-year-old girl, Ella Kissi-Debrah, from asthma in 2013.The problem is not limited to the capital, although as the UK\u2019s largest city by a huge margin, it attracts the most headlines. Between 2015 and 2018, the government was defeated three times in court by the environmental campaigner ClientEarth over illegal pollution levels across the country. While Bath and Birmingham are due to introduce similar low-emission schemes, other cities have put plans on hold.The new rules will make London safer, especially for people with respiratory vulnerabilities. About 10,000 low-income car owners have already been supported to scrap or retrofit older vehicles. But the mayor, Sadiq Khan, is right to point out, as he did on Thursday, that his scheme is only one part of a much\u00a0bigger picture. Recent flash floods showed\u00a0that the threat from global heating is rising\u00a0along with that from localised air pollution. What is needed to tackle both is a modal shift away from vehicle traffic and towards walking and\u00a0cycling. In this regard, London and other UK cities are a long way behind some European\u00a0neighbours.The climate and environmental challenges we face are so daunting that it can be tempting to ignore them. In linking the Ulez to a wider call for radical climate action, Mr Khan should help to discourage this and focus minds on the overwhelmingly important decisions that lie ahead. He should continue to come under strong pressure over his perverse commitment to a new road tunnel under the Thames, whose effects will be to worsen the problems that the Ulez is meant to alleviate. But the zone itself must be hailed as a step forward \u2013 and a breath of fresh air. This article was amended on 27 September 2021. Ella Kissi-Debrah was nine years old when she died, not seven as an earlier version said.",

        "text": "In last October\u2019s Brazilian election, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva defeated Jair Bolsonaro by a margin of 1.8%. That narrowest of victories may have been the single most important environmental development of 2022. With Mr Bolsonaro in power, the Amazon rainforest was hurtling towards a tipping point after which it would no longer function as a climate stabiliser and the world\u2019s biggest carbon sink. Between August 2021 and July 2022, an area of forest the size of Qatar was cleared in the interests of big business.Lula\u2019s government has stopped the rot. Companies involved in illegal deforestation have been sanctioned, armed interventions have taken place to end illegal mining operations, and new conservation areas have been established. Deforestation dropped by 42% during Lula\u2019s first seven months in office, and the state has returned as a protective presence in the Brazilian Amazon. The transformed political context was the catalyst for this week\u2019s landmark regional summit in Bel\u00e9m, in which the eight Latin American nations sharing the Amazon came together \u2013 for the first time in 14 years \u2013 to produce a plan for its sustainable development.The outcome was only a partial success. Tuesday\u2019s Bel\u00e9m declaration outlines important new areas of cooperation in combating illegal logging, mining and burning in the Amazon. But it failed to formalise a target of ending deforestation by 2030 \u2013 a commitment already adopted by Lula\u2019s Brazil, and one credited with driving much of the progress his government has made this year. Leaders were also unable to agree a common position on the future of industries such as cattle farming, mining and oil, which are driving the destruction. This was, then, a weaker document than environmental groups, and Lula himself, had hoped for. But as it rightly argues, game-changing progress in these areas will not be achieved without assistance \u2013 on a transformative scale \u2013 from the richer nations that have benefited from exploitation of the Amazon\u2019s resources. If less well-off countries facing huge financial challenges are to rethink the Amazon\u2019s economy, and protect its biodiversity, such stewardship in the global interest will need to be properly rewarded.Debt relief in exchange for climate action, as called for at the summit, would be a step in the right direction, and should be on the table at this year\u2019s Cop28 summit in Dubai. The subsidising of environmentally viable Amazon products should be stepped up, and China and the United States should follow the European Union\u2019s lead in blocking products linked to deforestation. The indigenous peoples who have been the most effective stewards of the land need to be better protected and empowered. The rainforest\u2019s future will only be truly safeguarded when its economics reward sustainable practice rather than the relentless production of beef in particular, the chief driver of land clearance. It is the responsibility of the world\u2019s most developed nations, as well as the signatories of the Bel\u00e9m declaration, to ensure that happens.Opening this week\u2019s summit, Lula envisioned a future Amazon \u201cwith greener cities, with cleaner air, with mercury-free rivers and forests that are left standing\u201d. By changing the political weather, the Brazilian president\u2019s election has opened a window of opportunity for the most valuable piece of green infrastructure on the planet. The world cannot afford for that opportunity to be missed. But the heavy lifting now required needs to be shared equitably.",

        "text": "Long-term exposure to even comparatively low levels of air pollution could cause depression and anxiety, according to a study exploring the links between air quality and mental ill-health.Tracking the incidence of depression and anxiety in almost 500,000 UK adults over 11 years, researchers found that those living in areas with higher pollution were more likely to suffer episodes, even when air quality was within official limits.Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry, the researchers, from the universities of Oxford and Beijing and Imperial College London, said their findings suggested a need for stricter standards or regulations for air pollution control.The findings come as the ministers face criticism for passing new legally binding air quality guidelines that allow more than double the levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) than equivalent targets set by the World Health Organization.Peers approved legislation this week that allows a maximum annual mean concentration of 12 micrograms per cubic metre by 2028. The WHO completed a review of its 2005 guideline air quality levels in September 2021, halving its limit for PM2.5 to five micrograms.Air pollution has long been implicated in a number of respiratory disorders but, the researchers noted, a growing body of evidence is establishing a link with mental health disorders. So far, however, the only available studies on the risk of depression were carried out in regions with air pollution concentrations exceeding UK air quality limits.The researchers drew on the data of 389,185 participants from the UK Biobank, modelling and giving a score to the air pollution, including PM2.5 and PM10, nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide for the areas in which they lived. They found 13,131 cases of depression and 15,835 of anxiety were identified among their sample within a follow-up period of about 11 years.As air pollution increased, the researchers found, so did cases of depression and anxiety. Exposure-response curves were non-linear, however, with steeper slopes at lower levels and plateauing trends at higher exposure, suggesting that long-term exposure to low levels of pollution were just just as likely to lead to diagnoses as exposure to higher levels.The researchers said they hoped policymakers would take their findings into account. \u201cConsidering that many countries\u2019 air quality standards are still well above the latest World Health Organization global air quality guidelines 2021, stricter standards or regulations for air pollution control should be implemented in the future policy making,\u201d they wrote.Anna Hansell, a professor of environmental epidemiology at the University of Leicester, who was not involved in the research, said the study was yet more evidence to support a lowering of legal limits to air pollution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It has also added a paragraph on the sale of these products that includes the sentence: \u201cWeeds are often classed as plants in the wrong place.\u201dThe RHS said for a number of weeks it had been removing products as part of an ongoing programme of reviewing ranges and sourcing sustainable alternatives.Weeds contribute to a garden\u2019s biodiversity, and weedkillers harm plants and organisms beyond those gardeners are trying to kill. Weeds and wildflowers may compete with crops for nutrients, light and water but many also attract pollinators while others can improve the soil.Traditional slug pellets contain metaldehyde, a toxic ingredient harmful to slugs and other wildlife. Birds and hedgehogs are unlikely to eat the pellets but can be harmed if theyconsume a dead snail or slug that has eaten them.Joel Ashton, a wildlife garden designer and author who has been campaigning on social media for the removal of these products, said the UK\u2019s wildlife was \u201cin decline, from insects right the way through to our birds and mammals\u201d.He added: \u201cThe RHS is still selling and promoting products that are detrimental to our native flora and fauna, including bees, beetles and other vital pollinating insects as well as targeting slugs and snails.\u201cThe continued ridding and killing of these species has a detrimental effect further up the food chain, for example birds like the song thrush, which is now a red-listed species, that relies on snails as a food source.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

There are some living free in parts of the UK, including Devon, and there is a large population in Scotland \u2013 there largely as a result of escapes from private collections and illegal releases.Beavers have been also released under licence in Scotland to bolster wild local beaver populations, and last year Nature Scot, Scotland\u2019s nature agency, published a plan for a widespread return of beaver to the country.It is unclear whether a future Labour government would legalise beaver releases into the wild.

With their dams, they create wetlands that are important for biodiversity \u2013 one study found that wild-living beavers have alleviated flooding, reduced pollution and boosted fish populations. Beavers are loved by wildlife campaigners who call them \u201cnature\u2019s gardeners\u201d.\u201cI was disappointed when I heard Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey say what she said recently in relation to her lack of priorities to rewilding.

Though they will remain in an enclosure, he hopes they can improve biodiversity there and bring locals closer to nature.\u201cThe first cage was the mother being let out and you could see the cage moving and I did get a bit scared, I\u2019ve got to be honest,\u201d Khan said of his experience with the beavers. \u201cBut when the mother went out she was a joy to watch and the two kits, when they got out of my cage, once they were in the water, they were swimming around, and one of them was proper posing. I named her Taylor Swift because she was dancing around, she was having a great time.\u201cI challenge you not to smile, when you see these beavers swimming around, in that lovely park in Ealing, and I want other people to enjoy just watching wildlife and having a smile.\u201dKhan is enthusiastic about nature and rewilding and has launched a multimillion pound plan to improve London\u2019s green spaces for nature, and add new ones. It was not just a good way to decarbonise the city, he said \u2013 it was also a social justice issue to bring nature closer to people.Khan also believes strong rewilding policies would be a vote-winner for Labour. He said: \u201cWhat\u2019s exciting is you can \u2026 say to people, listen, we\u2019re the party bringing forward policies to rewild, to have more greenery, it gives you another reason to vote for us in the next general election.\u201d",

        "text": "The UK government is to offer grants of \u00a3157m as part of its launch of a new body to support the nuclear power industry.Great British Nuclear (GBN) will be tasked with helping deliver the government\u2019s commitment to provide a quarter of the UK\u2019s electricity from nuclear energy by 2050.The new body will help drive rapid expansion of nuclear power plants in the UK, boost energy security and reduce dependence on fossil fuel imports, said the energy security secretary, Grant Shapps.It is hoped that a competition to develop small modular reactors (SMRs) will drive billions of pounds of investment into the technology, which the government hopes will be cheaper and quicker to build than traditional large nuclear power plants.However, environmental campaigners and academics have argued that SMRs have no track record and that time and resources would be better spent on renewables such as more offshore wind.The launch at the Science Museum in London on Tuesday was delayed from last week after it clashed with the government\u2019s public sector pay deal announcement.The government\u2019s previous attempts to attract funding for conventional large reactors have so far only yielded the much delayed and over-budget Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset.Shapps is expected to announce the winners of the competition in the autumn, with a number of manufacturing firms such as Rolls-Royce and Hitachi interested in developing SMRs.The government said it was still committed to Hinkley Point C and also Sizewell C, a nuclear power plant in Suffolk that was announced last year and has been backed with \u00a3700m of public funds.In addition to the competition launch, Shapps announced that up to \u00a3157m of grant funding would be available. There will be up to \u00a377m to accelerate the development of a nuclear business in the UK and support new designs, and a further \u00a358m for the development and design of a new advanced modular reactor that operates at higher temperatures.Shapps said: \u201cBritain has a rich history as a pioneer of nuclear power, having launched the era of civil nuclear power, and I\u2019m proud to be turbocharging its revival and placing our country once again at the forefront of global innovation. By rapidly boosting our homegrown supply of nuclear and other clean, reliable, and abundant energy, we will drive down bills for British homes and make sure the UK is never held to energy ransom by tyrants like [Vladimir] Putin.\u201cToday, as we open Great British Nuclear and the competition to develop cutting-edge small modular reactor technology, which could result in billions of pounds of public and private sector investment, we are seeing the first brushstrokes of our nuclear power renaissance to power up Britain and grow our economy for decades to come.\u201dDr Doug Parr, the chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, accused the government of \u201cobsessing\u201d over nuclear power and decried SMRs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No number of SMRs will fix the government\u2019s lacklustre effort to address issues of delayed connections, smart local grids and home efficiency.\u201dSteve Thomas, an emeritus professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, said: \u201cYet again, the British government has proved credulous to the claims of the nuclear industry that a new generation of technology will solve all the problems of its predecessors.\u201cSMRs are a long way from being commercially ready and at best will be as uneconomic as existing technology and at worst won\u2019t even be technically feasible.

Now all have pulled fundingRead moreThe agency has twice ignored court orders to study the impacts and is probably dodging the requirements because ethanol production \u201cprops up\u201d the corn industry, which has a politically powerful lobby, Hartl added.\u201cThe Biden administration failed to even modestly reform this boondoggle and crumbled again in the face of political pressure from powerful special interests,\u201d Hartl said. \u201cOur streams and rivers will choke with more pollution and coastal dead zones will continue to expand.\u201dThe EPA said in a statement that it does not comment on ongoing litigation.About 40% of all corn grown in the US is used for ethanol production, and nearly half is used as animal feed.The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set minimum levels of biofuel usage for the transportation sector. The new rule approved by the agency calls for about 15bn gallons (57bn liters) of conventional corn ethanol for each of the next three years, plus an increase from 5.9bn gallons to 7.3bn gallons of advanced biofuels during the same time period.While the fuels are designed to decarbonize the transportation sector, their production eliminates wetlands and prairie land that act as carbon sinks, Hartl noted. The EPA in 2018 estimated that up to 7m acres (2.8m hectares) of land had been converted to grow corn for ethanol fuel.The Biden administration crumbled again in the face of political pressure from powerful special interestsBrett Hartl of the Center For Biological DiversityEthanol production also pollutes water. Regulations around pesticides and fertilizers used in corn grown for ethanol fuel are much looser, which means much higher levels of dangerous chemicals run into surface and groundwaters. The pollution probably plays a significant role in dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico after pesticides flow down the Mississippi River, Hartl said.Still, the EPA has failed to adequately scrutinize those issues, he added, and has failed to fully comply with the Endangered Species Act. It requires the agency to complete consultations with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service to address harm to endangered species from land conversion, pesticides and fertilizer use.The biofuel rules cannot \u201cjeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat\u201d, the law states.The EPA is using \u201cdirty tricks\u201d to circumvent the law, Hartl said. Instead of meeting with the agencies before the rule was finalized, the EPA skirted the process by consulting with the agencies after it had completed its new rules, and just days before it sent the rules to the White House for final approval, Hartl said.The move comes after the DC circuit court ordered the EPA to consider harm to endangered species in 2019 and 2020. In a more recent settlement on the issue, the EPA again promised to properly analyze the fuels\u2019 impact on the environment, but did not, Hartl said.The agency has essentially claimed the issue is too complex to study and it has limited authority, Hartl added, which he characterized as a \u201ccop-out\u201d.\u201cEveryone knows [the EPA is] hugely determinative as to how much of this stuff makes it into people\u2019s cars,\u201d Hartl said. \u201cLast time I checked, that\u2019s supposed to be their job \u2013 to assess harms to the environment and rationally address them \u2013 but they\u2019re really not doing that.\u201dBecause the litigation is over a federal rule, the legal process does not require plaintiffs to ask for a remedy, and Hartl said the CBD was still considering what it will ask the court to do. But he said its attorneys would seek a \u201cmore aggressive remedy\u201d because the case marks the fourth time the two sides have been in court over the issue.If the EPA did take an \u201chonest look\u201d at the environmental harms caused by biofuel production, it would probably find that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits, Hartl said, adding he suspects the agency knows it would come to that conclusion.\u201cThere is very little evidence when you look at the full life cycle \u2013 transportation, processing, refining and, when you take into account land use, degradation \u2013 that corn ethanol is really making a difference,\u201d he said.",

The Tate, National Portrait Gallery, Royal Shakespeare Company, Scottish Ballet and Royal Opera House have all ended funding partnerships of many decades with the energy giant in recent years.Among major national museums and arts companies, only the Science Museum is still supported by BP, which funds its educational academy.BP has been a sponsor of the British Museum since 1996. On paper, the most recent five-year contract between the two expired in February, but the British Museum and BP have repeatedly resisted being explicit that their partnership was over, leading to concerns of an ongoing relationship behind the scenes.Campaigners feared the oil giant could be lined up as a potential funder for the radical \u00a31bn rebuilding scheme currently being planned by the museum.In the new disclosures, obtained by lawyers acting for the campaign group Culture Unstained, the museum said that \u201ccertain terms\u201d of the deal remain in effect, because it has verbally agreed to let BP exercise its \u201csupporter benefits\u201d until the end of 2023.It will not specify the supporter benefits, but these are likely to include hospitality privileges, such as use of the museum\u2019s spaces for corporate entertaining. However, this does not relate to any funding of the museum\u2019s activities.Asked to comment on the disclosures this week, the museum only repeated a previous statement, saying: \u201cBP is a valued long term supporter of the museum, and our current partnership runs until this year.\u201d BP did not respond to a request for comment.Chris Garrard, Culture Unstained\u2019s co-director, said the news represented a \u201cmassive victory\u201d. He added: \u201cIf it is serious about responding to the climate crisis, the museum must now confirm that there will be no future relationships with fossil fuel producers, take down BP\u2019s name from its lecture theatre and roundly reject the climate-wrecking business it represents.\u201dThe British-Egyptian novelist Ahdaf Soueif, who resigned as a trustee of the museum in 2019, partly in protest at the BP deal, said: \u201cIt is important that institutions like the British Museum do not give Big Oil the opportunity to look like a force for good in society; denying them this platform is important.\u201dShe said the institution was \u201cenormously important\u201d and influential \u2013 especially among children. She added: \u201cAt this time of global crisis, which particularly impacts the young, the museum should be directing its weight, its creativity and its resources to helping to create the world the coming generations need to live in.\u201d\u2018Inevitable\u2019 India\u2019s jewels taken by British empire will be returned, says authorRead moreDespite the museum\u2019s repeated insistence of the value of the partnership with BP, there have been hints of embarrassment behind the scenes, as protests over the relationship have grown.Louise Jolly, a former regular visitor from Hove, wrote to the museum last month saying she was reluctant to bring her children while it was sponsored by BP. She received a reply saying: \u201cNow is a really great time for you and your children to visit us. These exhibitions are not sponsored by BP and we do not currently have any other exhibitions sponsored by BP.\u201dSpeaking last November, the museum\u2019s chair, George Osborne, announced a \u201ccomplete reimagination\u201d of the museum and said he wanted it to become a net zero institution.",

Now we are in the midst of a second automotive revolution, it\u2019s critical America do so once more.\u201dThere are about 170,000 electric vehicle chargers in the US, a huge leap from a network that was barely visible prior to Biden taking office, and the White House has set a goal for 500,000 chargers to help support the shift away from gasoline and diesel cars.\u201cThe US is taking the lead globally on electric vehicles,\u201d said Ali Zaidi, a climate adviser to Biden who said the US is on a trajectory to \u201cmeet and exceed\u201d the administration\u2019s charger goal. \u201cWe will continue to see this buildout over the coming years and decades until we\u2019ve achieved a fully net zero transportation sector,\u201d he added.Electric vehicle sales are growing in the US, with more than 1m new EVs sold for the first time last year, accounting for 9% of all vehicle sales. But the rate of this increase has slowed somewhat and companies such as Ford, General Motors and even Tesla have scaled back their EV ambitions in recent months.American drivers are confronted by an expanding range of EVs that still are mostly more expensive than gasoline equivalents, meaning they aren\u2019t accessible to many buyers \u2013 research has found people who purchase EVs have a median household income of $186,000.Surveys have shown that around a third of potential EV buyers also discount the purchase due to a lack of charging infrastructure, even though most car journeys in the US total three miles or less. Even if the Biden goal of 500,000 chargers is met, this is still far less than the amount needed to support even a moderate transition away from polluting vehicles, with estimates that 28m chargers, or more, will be needed by 2030.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shelves lined the walls from floor to ceiling, all full of ingredients from the mainstream to the obscure. One product I came across back then was apple butter, a creamy, apple jam with a wonderful texture that I presume was the result of the natural pectin in the apples. It is a rare find these days, but fortunately it\u2019s very easy to make, and stores well, too, preserving floury, past-their-best apples for a rainy day.Maple apple butterAccording to the government waste scheme Wrap, we throw away around 800,000 apples in the UK every day. By this time of year, home-grown apples can often be a bit iffy, because they\u2019ve been in storage since late autumn and can therefore have turned floury and have a short shelf life. Apple butter is a great way to transform a bad batch or glut of reduced-price apples into something truly delicious. This thick puree stores well and is impressively versatile. Simply spread on toast, serve as a condiment alongside roast chicken, pork or potatoes, use it to flavour cocktails or even to fill homemade pastries or doughnuts.In the US, people often flavour apple recipes with a pre-made apple pie spice mix, and here\u2019s a rough guide to making your own. Mix a teaspoon of ground cinnamon, a quarter-teaspoon of ground nutmeg, an eighth of a teaspoon each of ground allspice and ginger, and a pinch of ground cloves; other spices you could add are ground turmeric, star anise, cardamom, mace and even a careful pinch of black pepper if you want some heat.Makes About 500ml1kg apples150ml apple cider vinegar1 tsp vanilla extract1 tsp sea salt2 tsp cinnamon (or American-style apple pie spice mix \u2013 see recipe introduction)100ml maple syrup, or 100g unrefined brown sugar, such as rapaduraCut the unpeeled apples into large chunks, then remove and compost the cores and any bruised bits, or use them to make apple cider vinegar. Tip the diced apples into a heavy-based pan with the apple cider vinegar, vanilla extract, sea salt, cinnamon (or apple pie spice mix) and 180ml water, then bring to a boil. Turn down the heat to a strong simmer, half cover the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 40 minutes, until reduced by half. Take off the lid, turn up the heat a touch, add the maple syrup and reduce for 20 minutes more, until the mixture turns thick and dark brown, and holds its shape when you stir it.Pour into a clean 500ml jar, seal and store in the fridge for up to a month, or freeze in smaller portions for up to a year.",

His major scientific contribution concerned his work on octopuses, in which he was engaged for most of his life.Andrew\u2019s study into why cephalopods change colour in complex patterns demonstrated that it was not just about camouflage but ways of communicating and expressing feelings.He was very critical of what he called the genetic determinists, who somehow \u201cmissed the magic\u201d of nature. He understood the theory of evolution as being about organisms as a whole and not just genes, and he argued that contemporary evolutionary theory, which is focused on genes, fails to take into account feelings (affect) and the role of altruism that can only be observed at the level of interactions between organisms within species. This alternative understanding of evolution, he suggested, was much more in line with Darwin\u2019s original ideas.Andrew was born in Sedbergh, Cumbria, to Katharine (nee Johnston), a nurse, and Eric, a teacher who later became a vicar. He was educated at Gordonstoun, initially in Wales to where the school was evacuated during the second world war (and when his parents both were on the staff as chaplain and matron), and then in Scotland when the school returned north after the war ended. He completed national service in the navy and then studied zoology at Pembroke College, Oxford.Andrew\u2019s first job was a lectureship in zoology at the University of New Zealand in Auckland. In 1959 he was invited to join the staff in Naples at the Stazione Zoologica. He then joined the University of Edinburgh in 1971, first as lecturer and later as reader in physiology, where students are said to have been \u201centranced\u201d by his lectures. He took early retirement from Edinburgh in 1988, partly as a protest against education cuts and the beginnings of bureaucratic staff assessment regulations, and accepted a chair in zoology at the University of Naples, describing himself as a \u201crefugee from Thatcher\u201d. Andrew also worked in the US; in Berkeley in the 1960s and later Stanford.Among other accomplishments, Andrew had a glacier in Antarctica named after him following a biological expedition in 1958; he was a founder of the Scottish Greens; he worked with Jacques Cousteau on his documentaries, advising him on cephalopod behaviour; climbed mountains with Sir Edmund Hillary, and he wrote several children\u2019s books, including Mr Spindles and the Spiders, published in 1961. He loved sports, especially cricket; and he was an accomplished draughtsman and watercolourist. He was also extraordinarily charming, and wonderful company.His two marriages, to Brigitta (nee Bayer) in 1973 and to Ann (nee Davidson) in 1982, ended in divorce. The love of his life was the artist Susanna Linhart, whom he had known from the 1960s. They entered a civil partnership shortly before she died in 2021. He spent his last three decades with Susanna in La Garde-Freinet, in the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur area.Andrew is survived by his sons, Ivan, from his relationship with Susanna, and Sasha and Kolje, from his first marriage, and by grandchildren, Natasha, Lucy, Emilia, Luis, Fergus and Lorna.",

It notes that a third of electric cars and batteries and nearly all solar photovoltaic modules and fuel cells come from outside the EU, mostly from China. Even in areas where EU industry remains strong, such as wind turbines and heat pumps, \u201cour trade balance is deteriorating and EU producers face headwinds of rising energy and input costs\u201d, it continues.EU leaders will discuss the plans at a Brussels summit later this month (23-24 March), as part of a broader push to speed up the green transition but also to boost the mining and extraction of critical raw materials in Europe, such as rare earths, aluminium and copper \u2013 ores and metals used to make electric batteries and wind turbines.To achieve the 40% target by the end of the decade, the EU executive wants to speed up planning permission for plants manufacturing net-zero technologies. Currently, it can take between two and seven years to build a new factory, depending on the technology and member state.The draft proposes that large plants producing net-zero technologies that are deemed \u201cstrategic\u201d should be able to get a permit within one year. Smaller strategic plants should be granted permission within nine months.Net-zero factories will be considered strategic if they help the EU reduce a heavy dependency on imports, lead to a significant expansion in capacity or create many high-skilled jobs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Some good can come of even the worst disaster. Amid all the suffering and difficulty of the pandemic, environmentally minded people spied a chance. Could the enforced immobility of life under Covid-19, the rediscovery of neighbourhood shops, parks and walks brought about by the closure of workplaces and schools, lead to a longer-term adjustment \u2013 a new car/life balance?For decades, green thinkers and politicians have advocated for a less automobile-centric culture. Transport policy unites two big themes of environmental politics: the idea that many people need to be reconnected with local geographies, both physical and human; and opposition to pollution. This means greenhouse gases, of course, but also particulate matter and noise. An altered transport hierarchy, it has long been argued, is beneficial to health, since more walking and cycling means less obesity, respiratory illness and heart disease; reduced road traffic also means fewer injuries and deaths caused by collisions.The need for cuts in air pollution and carbon emissions (with levels in many UK cities exceeding legal limits), combined with the practical urgency of the situation earlier this year, in which public transport use had to be reduced without increasing congestion, made walking and cycling the only good option. Policymakers saw this: the UK government provided \u00a3250m in emergency active travel funding; the Welsh and Scottish governments \u00a315.4m and \u00a310m respectively.Several months later, there is widespread agreement that the creation of dozens of new low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Edinburgh has produced some toxic politics along with quieter, safer streets. Planters placed on roads to block through traffic have been moved and damaged. Campaigners have been threatened. In several London boroughs, the strength of the reaction has led councils to retreat or consider retreating.New research suggests such decisions are mistaken. The idea that middle-class residents are the main beneficiaries of LTNs is revealed to be a myth, since about 90% of people from all demographic groups live on the kinds of residential streets where they are in place. Meanwhile, the announcement of funding from a south London NHS trust to support schemes in its area shows how significant health experts believe these beneficial effects are. This is not to deny the negative effects that LTNs can have, in displacing some traffic from quieter streets on to already busy ones. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, was right to signal the importance of consultation when releasing additional funding last week. But since LTNs are a \u201cnudge\u201d policy, intended to steer behaviour change rather than apply a sudden brake, you have to wait and see: traffic does not evaporate, or bicycles materialise, overnight.Change is difficult, and no set of arrangements suits everyone. Objectors have a right to protest. But the health and climate emergencies cannot be ignored. Car owners must not mistake comfort or convenience for a right to drive. Partly due to satnav systems, traffic on residential streets has increased hugely in recent years. Across Europe, cities have moved to reclaim their streets for uses other than driving. In recent months the UK has done some catching up. Councils should hold their nerve and talk to people as well as listen: the case for cutting car use is overwhelming.",

It was definitely behind her, and from the looks of it, its head had to have been underneath her board,\u201d said Barajas to WJZY.Hammerhead sharks have been spotted at other times in Florida\u2019s water. During the Fourth of July weekend, beachgoers in the Perdido Key area frantically left the water after spotting hammerheads, WEAR TV reported.But experts say that the appearance of hammerheads in Florida\u2019s water is normal.Dr Tristan Guttridge, a marine expert and founder of the conservation non-profit Saving the Blue, told the Guardian that the shark spotted by Barajas and Tribble was likely a younger great hammerhead, given its dorsal fin.Hammerheads usually travel between the Bahamas and the US, occasionally surfacing for navigational reasons. Guttridge said the hammerhead was likely curious about the presence of the paddleboards.\u201cMy guess is that this animal was inquisitive and it saw something novel in the environment,\u201d Guttridge told the Guardian. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to think about how this animal was viewing the object. He has no idea that there\u2019s anyone on top of it. It\u2019s looking at the silhouette of the board so it\u2019s probably wondering what it is.\u201dGuttridge added that hammerheads have \u201cno interest in us\u201d whatsoever and are actually skittish around humans, given his experience with swimming the sharks.\u201cTo my knowledge, there\u2019s never been a bite on a human from a hammerhead. To me, they\u2019d be one of the least dangerous large sharks out there,\u201d said Guttridge, before offering some advice.The best thing to do during an encounter is to exit the water, since most people can\u2019t identify type of shark they could be swimming with.\u201cThe best response is to very calmly walk out of the water and watch from the beach, and enjoy the moment of seeing what the sharks up to,\u201d said Guttridge.",

But critics say the court system would remain in place for oil and gas projects for at least a decade, during which time carbon emissions must be reduced by half to keep the 1.5C goal within reach.The academics\u2019 letter was sent to Grant Shapps, the secretary of state for the new Department for Energy Security and Net Zero. \u201cInvestors have already brought cases against countries for phasing out coal-fired power stations, banning the exploitation of oil and gas near their coastline, and requiring environmental impact assessments,\u201d the group said.\u201cThere is also evidence that countries are shying away from introducing new legislation for fear of being challenged in claims under the ECT,\u201d the academics said. \u201cWe urge you to take this opportunity to announce that the UK will withdraw.\u201d The UK and Japan are the last large economies not to have said they will leave the ECT.A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK is closely monitoring the situation surrounding the energy charter treaty\u2019s modernisation process, including the positions taken by other [member nations]. We have been a strong advocate for updating the treaty to ensure it is aligned with modern energy priorities, modern international treaty practice, and international commitments on climate change.\u201d Agreement on modernisation was due in November but has been delayed until at least April.Oil, gas and coal firms have been awarded more than $100bn (\u00a382.5bn) by ECT tribunals. The UK oil firm Rockhopper was recently awarded $190m in a case it brought against Italy, which is contesting the decision. ECT critics have estimated the final cost in compensation to fossil fuel companies could rise to more than $1tn. Some renewable energy companies have also used the ECT to sue for compensation after subsidy changes.The Guardian revealed in November that the ECT court system was accused of institutional bias, self-regulation issues and perceived conflicts of interest. \u201cThe energy charter treaty is not consistent with the Paris climate agreement,\u201d said Patrice Dreiski, a former ECT executive. \u201cThe main goal of the ECT is to promote and protect fossil fuel investment, which is not at all the goal of the Paris agreement.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

One container held 1,000 25kg sacks of the tiny balls, which are used in the manufacture of plastic products.In the weeks since the spill, millions of the pellets have washed up on beaches in north-west Spain, prompting a clean-up operation by regional workers and volunteers.On Tuesday, the regional governments of Galicia and neighbouring Asturias issued level 2 alerts, which will allow more personnel and resources to be assigned to the task as well as logistical assistance from the Spanish government\u2019s environment and transport ministries.Alfonso Rueda, the regional president of Galicia, said there was still time to stop more pellets washing up on the shoreline. \u201cThere are hundreds of sacks right now that have not reached the coast,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cThe time to collect them, or at least to try, is now that they are at sea. It seems there will be currents these days that will make it a little easier.\u201dSome of the pellets that washed up on the Galician coast at Seiras beach in Porto do Son, A Coru\u00f1a, on Tuesday. Photograph: Brais Lorenzo/EPAThe regional government of Asturias said it has raised the alert level after detecting \u201ca significant increase in the strip of coast affected and an increase in the number of spots identified\u201d.The incident has led to a political row between Galicia\u2019s conservative regional government and the socialist-led central government. Rueda said the central government had known about the spillage for two weeks before it informed his administration on 4 January. The Galician government has also said it is satisfied that the pellets are not toxic.Asked why he had waited so long to secure central government help by declaring the level 2 alert, Rueda said his team had found out about the situation only \u201ca few days ago\u201d, while the national government \u201chas known the details for a month\u201d.Spain\u2019s environment minister, Teresa Ribera, had previously said the government was ready to help as soon as its assistance was sought.People work to clean O Vilar beach of the pellets on Galicia\u2019s coast at Corrubedo natural park, A Coru\u00f1a province, on Tuesday.

Our teams are ready to respond as soon as they\u2019re called on.\u201dVoters in Galicia go to the polls next month in a regional election. As the political squabbling continued, ecological groups called for a quick and coordinated response, saying the situation was already reminiscent of the confused reaction to the disastrous Prestige oil spill in Galicia two decades ago.In a joint letter, Friends of the Earth, Ecologists in Action, Greenpeace, SEO/Birdlife and the WWF said there could be \u201cno repeat of the nightmare management of an environmental crisis\u201d.\u201cEnvironmental organisations are monitoring the Galician regional government\u2019s reaction to the spill with concern as it serves as a bitter reminder of the black tide of the Prestige in 2002 and 2003 and the lack of coordination with the central government,\u201d the letter said.\u201cWe ask that no partisan use is made of the catastrophe and that joint efforts are made to tackle the long-term impact of the spill, to determine responsibilities, and to reinforce the rules on the production, transport and use of plastics.\u201dThe European Commission warned of the dangers posed by plastic pellets three months ago.\u201cOnce in the environment, these small particles of plastics do not biodegrade and cannot be removed,\u201d it said in October. \u201cThey accumulate in animals, including fish and shellfish, and are consequently also consumed by humans in food. They contribute to the pollution with microplastics, which have been found in marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems as well as in food and drinking water.\u201d",

        "text": "Male staff at a leading Kenyan carbon-offsetting project used by Netflix, Shell and other large companies have been accused of extensive sexual abuse and harassment over more than a decade, following an investigation by two NGOs.The Kasigau Corridor conservation project in southern Kenya, operated by the California-based firm Wildlife Works, generates carbon credits by protecting dryland forests at risk of being destroyed in key elephant, lion and wildlife habitats west of Mombasa. The scheme was the first ever forest protection scheme approved by Verra, the world\u2019s leading certifier of carbon offsets, and has also been accredited for its biodiversity and community benefits, probably generating millions of dollars in revenue in carbon-credit sales.A new report by the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) and the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (Somo), a Dutch NGO, alleges extensive sexual abuse, harassment and exploitation between 2011 and 2023 by senior male employees of Wildlife Works, according to the testimonies of 31 current and former male and female staff as well as members of the local community.In a statement on Friday, which was updated on Sunday, Wildlife Works\u2019 president, Mike Korchinsky, said after the company was made aware of the allegations in August, it suspended three people. An internal investigation conducted by a Kenyan law firm found evidence that two individuals had engaged in \u201cdeeply inappropriate and harmful behaviour\u201d, he said.Korchinsky apologised for the \u201cpain that had been caused\u201d but denied the problem was widespread, saying that the substantiated sexual harassment misconduct had been perpetrated by one individual. He also said some of the allegations had not been substantiated.Wildlife Works said it was in the final stages of the disciplinary process and would say more once it had finished. On Friday, Verra said it had launched an investigation into the project.The report, based on interviews by staff from the NGOs, who are trained in dealing with gender-based violence, includes allegations of a physical assault and attempted rape on company premises.Senior men used their positions to demand sex in return for promotions and better treatment, the report alleges. The wives of male rangers were also pursued by one perpetrator, a senior member of staff, who allegedly told them that their husbands\u2019 jobs depended on them having sex with him.In a letter sent in August to Wildlife Works from Somo and the KHRC, seen by the Guardian, the organisations alleged extensive sexual abuse at the project by multiple members of staff. They only named one alleged perpetrator but stated that the issue was extensive.Carbon credit speculators could lose billions as offsets deemed \u2018worthless\u2019Read moreKasigau Corridor conservation project is marketed for its contribution to women\u2019s empowerment in the area, a claim echoed by some firms that have bought credits, such as Netflix. One video, produced by Netflix to promote the project, says \u201ca key part of this project is empowering women\u201d. Shell has bought nearly 2m credits from the scheme, according to data from AlliedOffsets, while Netflix has bought a quarter of a million. Several other large companies have used credits from the project for climate and biodiversity commitments. Netflix did not respond to a request for comment.Somo\u2019s executive director, Audrey Gaughran, said that during interviews with affected women, it became clear that the allegations were well known among employees. \u201cWe received accounts from women, who were current and past employees of Wildlife Works, who were sexually harassed, sexually assaulted, physically assaulted in sexual ways,\u201d she said. \u201cSexualised slurs were shouted at women.\u201dEnvironmental research conducted at the Kasigau Corridor conservation project. Photograph: Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images\u201cPerpetrators could act with relative impunity because they were senior males and nobody seemed to be able to touch them. One perpetrator in particular, the most named, goes to the wives of rangers once the rangers are stationed out on the property. The implication is: \u2018Your husband has a job because of me. Do you want him to keep his job?\u2019 That was very difficult for some of the men to talk about,\u201d she said.The allegations come amid widespread concerns about the environmental integrity of many forest protection offsets. This year, a joint Guardian investigation found huge numbers of credits were \u201clargely worthless\u201d and found evidence of forced clearances at a leading project in Peru. The findings were disputed by Verra.Verra is expected to release its new rules for generating carbon credits ahead of the Cop28 climate change conference in Dubai, which begins later this month.\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X (formerly known as Twitter) for all the latest news and features\n",

        "text": "US oil firms have been accused of using scare tactics after telling a federal court on Tuesday that lawsuits alleging fossil fuel companies lied about the climate crisis could threaten America\u2019s oil supply.At a closely watched appeals court hearing to decide whether a lawsuit by the city of Baltimore should be heard in state or federal court, an attorney for BP, Exxon, Shell and other energy firms painted the case as a threat to America\u2019s energy independence.Big oil and gas kept a dirty secret for decades. Now they may pay the priceRead moreKannon Shanmugam, representing the industry, told the court that if the city were to succeed in state court, and win billions of dollars in compensation, that could kill offshore drilling.\u201cThe relief that Baltimore seeks would deter, if not render entirely impractical, any further production on the outer continental shelf,\u201d he said.Karen Sokol, a law professor at Loyola University who specialises in climate litigation, called the claim one of a number of \u201cscare tactics\u201d deployed by the oil industry as it fights to move the Baltimore case and other cases out of state jurisdictions, where consumer protection and other laws favour the plaintiffs, and into federal courts, where the fossil fuel companies believe they have the advantage.\u201cIt\u2019s a scare tactic, which is telling the courts to back off, we\u2019re a very powerful industry and we\u2019re essential right now to energy security. If you step into this, you\u2019re going to screw everything up,\u201d she said.Baltimore\u2019s case accuses oil firms of breaching Maryland state consumer protection and other laws by running disinformation campaigns to cover up what they knew about the dangers of burning fossil fuels.The outcome of Tuesday\u2019s hearing will influence similar cases within the same federal jurisdiction, including a suit by Charleston, South Carolina. It may also have a bearing on nearly a dozen other lawsuits by states and municipalities in other jurisdictions. A federal appeals court in Hawaii is scheduled to hear a similar case next month.Shanmugam told the court that the case should fall under federal jurisdiction because pollution is regulated by national laws, and the climate crisis is a national and international issue. Shanmugam also accused Baltimore and other municipalities of using the courts to try to change climate policy.\u201cGlobal climate change is obviously the subject of international agreements, as well as pervasive regulation by the federal government,\u201d he said.Vic Sher, representing Baltimore, said the city\u2019s case was not about the regulation of pollution but the lies told by the fossil fuel industry.\u201cThe goal of the complaint, sadly, cannot address global climate change. It\u2019s focused very narrowly on a past pattern of conduct based on deception and failure to warn, and it seeks compensatory damages for injuries that flow from that past conduct,\u201d he said.Sokol said the judges appeared \u201cvery sceptical\u201d about the basis of the oil industry\u2019s claim that the Baltimore case belongs in federal court. She said the industry\u2019s legal argument did not address the substance of the city\u2019s claim that big oil ran a disinformation campaign and lied about the harm caused by its part in creating the climate crisis, and instead tried to put the focus on who regulates pollution.Sokol said that if the appeals court decision went against the oil industry, she expected the firms to try to go back to the supreme court as part of a strategy to delay the Baltimore case and others being heard by a jury for as long as possible.\u201cIt will continue to fight this thing out in the procedural stage till hell freezes over, before it allows it to get to discovery, much less a trial, because it knows the civil discovery system of state courts is so powerful that it would be forced to disgorge documents that would shed light on the extent of this disinformation campaign even beyond what we already know.\u201d",

He is the chair of League Two\u2019s Forest Green Rovers, known as the \u201cworld\u2019s greenest football club\u201d.Vince told the Guardian: \u201cWe want to prove that one of the last frontiers [of decarbonisation] can be broken and that it\u2019s not insolvable.\u201cA lot of people seem to think that people who are eco-conscious want everyone to live a life of self-denial in a cave. Green living is not about giving things up \u2013 everything we like to have in this life can be done in a net zero life.\u201dThe airline will launch with several green-striped 19-seater planes capable of travelling for 300 miles. Vince hopes to expand the number of routes out to cover all of Britain\u2019s big cities.Staff will wear environmentally friendly uniforms, and serve plant-based meals.A second phase, 18 months later, will result in 70-seater planes capable of flying to Europe being introduced. The company is in the process of applying for a licence from the Civil Aviation Authority and securing takeoff and landing slots at airports.However, the process of launching an airline is regarded as slow, and Ecojet will not launch as an electric plane operator, starting by using kerosene-based fuel instead.Vince admitted he was not entirely happy with starting the project by burning fossil fuels but said that the airline needed to launch quickly to secure planes and landing slots and \u201ckeep up the momentum\u201d of the project.\u201cIt does feel like a contradiction but at the heart of this project is upcycling existing planes and retrofitting them. This is the pragmatic approach, which means we won\u2019t lose time. We will build up the infrastructure, get the planes in the air and swap in the engines when they are available.\u201dThe aviation industry is examining various options to decarbonise, including electric flight and the use of sustainable aviation fuel, a biofuel that can be made from agricultural products.

He said he would invest \u00a31m initially but plans to raise further funds next year.The Virgin Atlantic founder, Richard Branson, reportedly once remarked: \u201cIf you want to be a millionaire, start with a billion dollars and launch a new airline.\u201d Vince said: \u201cThey say the same about football clubs.\u201cI want to prove that it can be done and it\u2019s worthwhile.

Decades later, scientists have found that the pesticide remains in high concentrations on the ocean floor and has never broken down.Nearly two years after the discovery of tens of thousands of barrels of waste off the coast of Los Angeles, a scientist working on the issue shared this week that the chemical is still spread across a vast stretch of the seafloor, the Los Angeles Times reported.\u201cWe still see original DDT on the seafloor from 50, 60, 70 years ago, which tells us that it\u2019s not breaking down the way that [we] once thought it should,\u201d David Valentine, a UC Santa Barbara scientist, said. The LA Times reported that the contamination covered an area of seafloor larger than the city of San Francisco. \u201cAnd what we\u2019re seeing now is that there is DDT that has ended up all over the place, not just within this tight little circle on a map that we referred to as dumpsite two.\u201dCalifornia\u2019s legacy of DDT waste: underwater dump site uncovers a toxic historyRead moreDDT, which was widely used in the US as an agricultural pesticide and sprayed in large quantities at beaches to kill mosquitoes, has been linked to cancer and disease in humans and the mass die-off of animals. In the 1970s, it was banned in the US due to its harmful effects on wildlife and potential risks to humans. Research has shown a link between exposure to the chemical and breast cancer as well as reproductive problems.Southern California was the center of DDT production in the US. The Montrose Chemical Corporation in Torrance produced massive amounts of the chemical between the end of the second world war through 1982. During that time, before Congress banned such activity, up to 2,000 barrels a month of acid sludge waste containing DDT were dumped off the coast. Workers sometimes poked holes in the barrel so they would sink more quickly.In late 2020, a report from the LA Times told the story of how LA\u2019s coast became a dumping ground for DDT, revealing that as many as half a million barrels could still be on the sea floor, prompting Senator Dianne Feinstein to ask the EPA to take action.A two-week survey, conducted in 2021 by a team from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California, San Diego and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, using seafloor robots, sonar acoustic imagery and data helped reveal the scale of the issue, finding more than 25,000 barrels. Scientists identified more than 100,000 human-made items across the entire survey area.A sea lion suffering from a blood infection in Sausalito, California. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesScientists\u2019 most recent analysis has found that the most concentrated layer of DDT is roughly 6cm deep in the sediment, the Times reported.\u201cTrawls, cable lays, could reintroduce this stuff back up to the surface,\u201d Valentine told the newspaper. \u201cAnd animals feeding \u2013 if a whale goes down and burrows on the seafloor, that could kick stuff up.\u201dDDT has already been linked to continued harmful affects on wildlife. On the central California coast, which also served also a dumping ground for DDT, a 20-year-long study found a link between exposure to contaminants and high rates of cancer and herpes in sea lions.Congress has allotted millions of dollars toward researching the issue. \u201cThe federal funding we secured will be significant for advancing research to understand the scope and scale of DDT pollution off the coast of southern California,\u201d Feinstein said on Twitter. \u201cWe must act quickly to clean this up.\u201d",

More than a quarter of the activity of transport and energy vessels is also missing from public tracking systems, it found.While fishing decreased globally by 12% over the study period of 2017-2021 due to the Covid pandemic, the research showed that the number of offshore structures at sea grew rapidly, with wind turbines surpassing the number of oil structures in 2021. China\u2019s offshore wind energy has increased ninefold since 2017, while the biggest offshore wind developers in Europe \u2013 the UK and Germany \u2013 saw an increase of 49% and 28% respectively.Hundreds of fishing fleets that go \u2018dark\u2019 suspected of illegal hunting, study findsRead moreThe analysis of ocean industrialisation reveals hotspots of potential illegal activity, including industrial fishing vessels encroaching on artisanal fishing grounds or other countries\u2019 waters.

In contrast, growth in our ocean has been largely hidden from public view. This study helps eliminate the blind spots and shed light on the breadth and intensity of human activity at sea.\u201dMap: proportion of industrial fishing activity recorded by public tracking systemsThe open data, technology and mapping used in the study will be freely available, said Kroodsma, heralding a new era in ocean management and transparency. It could help with estimates of greenhouse gas emissions at sea, or with tracking marine degradation caused by oil pollution, he said.Researchers from GFW; the University of Wisconsin-Madison; Duke University; University of California, Santa Barbara; and SkyTruth analysed 2m gigabytes of satellite imagery between 2017 and 2021 to detect vessels and offshore infrastructure in coastal waters across six continents, where 75% of industrial activity is concentrated.By combining GPS data with years of radar and optical imagery, from the European Space Agency and others, they were able to identify vessels that failed to broadcast their positions, and by using AI they were able to estimate which were likely to be engaging in fishing activity.Bo Qiang 3060, a wind turbine installation ship, in Shandong, China.

In recent years, the largest cases of illegal fishing and forced labour were by fleets that mostly did not use automatic identification system (AIS) devices.Data from AIS alone suggests that Europe and Asia have comparable industrial fishing activity. But the new global map, which reveals vessels not broadcasting on AIS, shows that Asia dominates \u2013 for every 10 fishing vessels on the water, seven were in Asia, while only one was in Europe.The study, supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies and GFW\u2019s technological partner, Google, found that offshore energy development surged over five years, with a 16% increase in oil structures and a doubling in wind turbines.",

Weakened by the drought in the north of Kenya, the camel needs help to get back on its feet to find pasture.Kenya is facing its worst drought in decades, and the north \u2013 a region that has been marginalised for a long time \u2013 is disproportionately affected.View image in fullscreen\nAli Hillow Hassan photographed in March at the IDP camp on the outskirts of Garissa\nAli Hillow Hassan, 74, a pastoralist, has lost nearly 80 camels this year. He has only two left, and is doing whatever he can to help them through the drought. On the margins of a camp for people who have left their homes in search of water and support, the smell of dead carcasses fills the air. Witnessing their camels, one of the world\u2019s most resilient animals, die is a sign of extremely difficult times, say the pastoralists.Hillow migrated to Garissa County from Wajir, about 185 miles to the north, in hope of finding better water and pasture for his livestock. Garissa is experiencing the highest number of new arrivals from northern states, according to International Organization for Migration data. The county is hard-hit by the drought, but less so than other regions \u2013 categorised by government agencies as being on \u201calert\u201d rather than in states of \u201calarm\u201d or \u201cemergency\u201d, such as those farther north.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreen\nA water truck makes a delivery to an IDP camp on the outskirts of Garissa; a camel grazes near the camp\nBut for Hillow, things are only marginally better in Garissa.

An estimated one million waterbirds die of lead poisoning in the EU every year.Under the ban adopted by the European Commission from 16 February, shooters will have to use non-toxic ammunition such as steel, bismuth or other non-toxic metals in or within 100 metres of wetlands.The move has been welcomed by campaigners. \u201cThis is huge,\u201d said Barbara Herrero, senior EU nature policy officer at BirdLife Europe. \u201cDespite banning lead from paint, pencils and virtually everything else several decades ago, it was still allowed to poison our shared environment \u2013 even when alternatives exist.\u201cWith this ban, the EU has addressed a significant part of the problem. We now call on EU countries to make sure the ban is enforced.\u201dIn the EU, 44,000 tonnes of lead ends up in the environment every year; 57% from sports shooting, 32% from hunting, and 11% from fishing.Waterbirds are believed to eat the shot, mistaking it for food or grit, which they need to help digest food. Scavengers and predatory birds are poisoned by eating lead shot in their prey. Birds that have ingested lead are often weakened due to the release of dangerous toxins and are more likely to be targeted by predators, which in turn spreads the contamination through the ecosystem.\u201cIt\u2019s such a huge milestone,\u201d said Dr Julia Newth, from the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust (WWT). \u201cLead shot has been contaminating wetlands for more than a century; finally, this law is coming into force. It\u2019s something to be celebrated, but there is more work to be done, with wider restrictions currently being considered in the European Union.\u201dA shotgun loaded with cartridges, ready for the hunt. Photograph: Pascal Pochard-Casabianca/AFP/GettyThe UK, where up to 100,000 waterbirds die of lead poisoning each year, is considering introducing wider restrictions on lead ammunition across all habitats, with a decision pushed back to next year.Newth supports a complete ban on lead ammunition in all British habitats. \u201cMany species of waterbirds, such as Bewick\u2019s swans, feed outside wetlands in areas where it is currently legal to shoot with lead and become poisoned,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know current restrictions aren\u2019t working.\u201dIn England and Wales, using lead shot to kill wildfowl on foreshores and listed wetlands is banned, but researchers say there is poor compliance. Lead shot is already banned in wetlands in Northern Ireland and Scotland, but according to the WWT, the number of birds eating it has not gone down. This could be because shooters are continuing to use it or because the birds have been eating lead shot in fields where it can still be used.Game killed with lead shot is also a risk to people, potentially harming the developing brain and nervous system, with children and pregnant women most vulnerable. Waitrose \u2013 Britain\u2019s largest retailer of game \u2013 has banned the sale of game shot with lead due to these health concerns.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Britain\u2019s farmers increased their yields of major crops last year despite significant reductions in fertiliser use, according to research.Making artificial fertilisers relies on natural gas, the price of which rose sharply last year after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Fertiliser prices more than tripled, from \u00a3233 a tonne in 2020 to \u00a3766 a tonne in 2022, which farmers say led to a reduction in their use.Data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) published last week revealed that for key crops \u2013 wheat, barley, oilseed rape and sugar beet \u2013 fertiliser use decreased by an average of 27% compared with the 2010-19 average. Despite this, yields of those crops were 2.4% above average compared with the same period.An exception to the trend was the 10% increase in the use of fertilisers in the cultivation of potatoes, with a 8.6% reduction in yield.Fertiliser use in agriculture is a major cause of pollution. In 2022, Defra found that pressure from agriculture accounted for 40% of pollution in inland water bodies. They estimated that 50% of nitrate pollution, 25% of phosphorus in the water environment and 75% of sediment pollution came from agriculture.Martin Lines, the chief executive of the Nature Friendly Farming Network (NFFN), a group of farmers who campaign for sustainability in the industry, said the data showed how reduced fertiliser usage \u201ccan bring big benefits to the business and beyond\u201d.While the \u201calarming\u201d price rises of fertiliser came as a \u201creal shock\u201d to farmers, Lines said, the minimal impact on yield was unsurprising. \u201cWe know that a lot of fertiliser applied to fields in the UK is not taken up by the crop, and instead gets washed into rivers and streams.\u201dDavid Lord, an arable farmer based in Essex, described the move towards natural fertilisation methods as \u201cdefinitely driven by economics\u201d. He said he had reduced nitrogen usage by approximately 30% in the last decade, and believed that the recent gas crisis had forced farmers to become more environmentally efficient.\u201cPeople are learning that using less fertiliser opens up the opportunity to try more nature-friendly methods,\u201d Lord said. \u201cArtificial fertilisers have a cost to us as growers, but also to the climate.\u201dArtificial fertilisers can also be detrimental to plants, according to Andrew Mahon, an arable farmer in Bedfordshire. Having reduced his use of artificial nitrogen by 15%, Mahon likened nitrogen fertilisers to \u201cdrinking four espressos in the morning. It gets you buzzing, and you get that comedown afterwards. And it leaves plants more prone to disease\u201d.Although decreased fertiliser use appeared to have little impact on yield in 2022, Lord and Mahon acknowledged that last year\u2019s harvest was an anomaly. Mahon said: \u201cCrops were pretty good last year and there was so much sunlight. That is what drove yield last year.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to make a statement from one year,\u201d Lord said. \u201cPlants managed to perform a lot better than they do normally.\u201dBoth Lord and Mahon expressed the importance of using nitrogen for fertilisation. Lord described nitrogen fertiliser as \u201cessential to growing consistent live food\u201d for farmers, but admitted that there was a need to use less of it.Lord said the \u201ccrackdown\u201d on urea by the government had been frustrating for farmers. \u201cUrea is a really important product,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have it, it would be more harmful for the climate.\u201dIn 2022, the government announced that the use of untreated urea would be restricted from 15 January to the end of March each year.The move away from artificial fertilisation had led to a return to mixed farming methods among farmers, Lord and Mahon said. This includes livestock farming, which is the best way of cycling nutrients into soil, according to Lord, which he said was one way farmers could \u201cdecrease usage [of artificial fertiliser] without actually impacting production\u201d. This article was amended on 31 July 2023. A previous version stated that \u201cfertiliser prices almost tripled from \u00a3233 a tonne in 2020 to \u00a3766 a tonne in 2022\u201d; however, \u00a3766 is more than triple \u00a3233.",

The backing from Octopus is the first step,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is no longer just about pools, however. We have received interest from a wide range of other potential partners who could make use of our free heat, such as district heating networks.\u201dProcessing data generates a lot of wasted heat, which Deep Green\u2019s scheme aims to repurpose to provide free heat for energy-intensive organisations such as leisure centres, which have been affected by soaring bills in the cost of living crisis, with many having to close or cut hours.Guardian research last year revealed England had lost almost 400 swimming pools since 2010, with parts of the country with the greatest health needs losing out the most.In Exmouth, the swimming pool was able to slash its heating bill by more than 60%. In return, Deep Green gets free cooling which provides it with a significant competitive edge over traditional data centres.Installed on-site, Deep Green data centres do not require additional grid upgrades or planning permission and can be up and running in a matter of weeks, the company says.The technique works for the data centre and the pool \u2013 the heat from the computers warms the water and the transfer of heat into the pool cools the computers.The new investment came via Octopus\u2019s dedicated energy transition fund.Zoisa North-Bond, the chief executive of Octopus Energy Generation, said: \u201cTo tackle the energy crisis head-on, we need innovative solutions to unusual problems. By using excess heat from data centres to slash energy bills for communities across the UK, Deep Green solves two problems with one solution. We\u2019re looking forward to rapidly rolling this out and positively impacting even more people as we drive towards a cleaner, cheaper energy future.\u201dBjornsgaard added: \u201cPlacing data centres within the fabric of society transforms the waste heat they produce into a valuable resource that benefits communities.\u201cThe data centre sector is rightly facing scrutiny about its growing energy demand and associated carbon emissions.

The report blamed a lack of public charging infrastructure in the UK, and warned that the government\u2019s decision to delay a ban on the sale of new combustion engine vehicles could shake investor confidence.The prime minister announced plans to push back the ban on new fossil fuel vehicles from 2030 until 2035 as part of a significant watering down of the government\u2019s key climate policies designed to help Britain become net zero by 2050.The unexpected U-turn has led to confusion among carmakers and electric vehicle infrastructure investors by raising uncertainty over how soon British drivers will make the switch to electric options. This could further delay expansion of charging networks, according to the report.The analysis found the UK now has 11.3 electric vehicles for every publicly accessible charge point, leading to \u201crange anxiety\u201d for drivers considering buying an electric vehicle for longer journeys.In the Netherlands there is 2.8 electric vehicles for each public charge point, while Sweden and Germany have 8.4 and 12.8 respectively, according to the data for Shoosmiths\u2019 electric vehicle country attractiveness (EVCA) index.Jamie Maule, a research analyst at Cornwall Insight, said the challenges to the UK\u2019s electric vehicle rollout risked being compounded by Sunak\u2019s decision to delay the ban on sales of new combustion engine vehicles.The prime minister also signalled a slowdown in the phasing out of gas boilers and promised to scrap a requirement for landlords to make their properties energy efficient.\u201cThis threatens to erode the country\u2019s momentum in shifting away from traditional fossil fuel cars,\u201d Maule said. He added: \u201cOnly by reaffirming our commitment to EV infrastructure growth, bolstering incentives, and rekindling investor and consumer confidence, can the UK reclaim lost ground and position itself among the leading nations in Europe for EV adoption.\u201dThe index found Norway was the most attractive country in which to invest in electric vehicles, followed by the Netherlands, France and Germany. The UK ranked eighth in the league table of 15 European nations, down two places from last year.Chris Pritchett, a partner at Shoosmiths, said carmakers and chargepoint operators were investing billions in the electric transition \u201cbut the government\u2019s screeching U-turn on policy threatens new investment into the UK\u2019s wider green industry\u201d.He added: \u201cMore importantly, it frames net zero as a political wedge issue ahead of the election which is clearly \u2013 and unforgivably \u2013 aimed at dividing the consensus on meaningful climate action.\u201d",

The London conurbation, for example, includes chains of lakes, many of which are suitable for swimming, as well as former docks and stretches of the Thames and other rivers that between them could provide far more swimming opportunities than open air pools ever have.The main barrier in the case of the rivers is the dumping of sewage, which may require investment to fix \u2013 but that investment is essential for other environmental reasons anyway. In the case of the lakes and docks, the main barrier is simply that landowners \u2013 public authorities as well as private landlords \u2013 either ban swimming or permit it only in designated areas, often during restricted hours and with significant entry fees.The situation is repeated all over the country: stretches of water could provide free swimming, but access is denied. What is needed here is not huge public expenditure, but political will. Margaret DickinsonLondon John Harris is right to point to the demise of the country\u2019s public swimming pools and associated leisure centres. I would question the need to heat outdoor pools in Devon between May and September, in particular the pool he mentions in Buckfastleigh, currently costing \u00a326,000 a year to heat. In May 1945, at the age of 11, I had swimming lessons in an unheated pool opposite our school at Hoylake. I believe that very few, if any, public pools were heated at that time.Were we tougher in those times? Perhaps we were \u2013 but maybe this current financial climate presents an opportunity to toughen up again \u2013 and set about enjoying a full summer of unheated outdoor swimming.Donald RiggTotnes, Devon John Harris reminds me of an occasion in the 1980s when we in Gateshead were favoured with a ministerial visit. This was an opportunity for a cabinet minister to see how we were using the money that Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government was generously allowing us to borrow.He was accompanied by a junior minister, whose appointment had raised eyebrows owing to his well-known rightwing views. He had no official role that day and so floated around talking to people, including local councillors such as me. He gave us the benefit of his views, which differed somewhat from the approved party line. Gateshead, he said, was suffering from a disease called \u201cleisure-centre-itis\u201d. He was unimpressed, clearly, by the \u201cpools, gyms and squash courts\u201d that John Harris mentions.That MP is still around, interviewed from time to time as one of the voices from the government backbenches. I\u2019m guessing that he is not viewing the imminent threat to Gateshead\u2019s leisure facilities with much concern.Paul TinnionGateshead, Tyne and Wear John Harris is right to highlight the \u201cterrifying stupidity\u201d of the government\u2019s policy of allowing publicly accessible swimming pools to close, while subsidising the \u201chospitality\u201d industry. He could also have mentioned the 20% VAT that it levies on children\u2019s swimming lessons and public admissions.David PerryShirley swimming pool, Southampton",

Here are the wedge issues the Tories are expected to deploy against Labour to paint them as \u201canti-motorist\u201d:Electric carsSunak\u2019s controversial delaying of climate pledges was a huge moment and the headline was the delay to banning the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by five years to 2035. While it led to international condemnation, it allows the Tories to attack Labour as the party who will force voters to buy electric cars sooner - Sunak has already signalled that he wants to turn it into a cost of living issue. Labour has said it will reinstate the ban should it win the next election and has already argued businesses have been investing with that target in mind.The 20mph limit in WalesSunak has cited the decision by the Welsh Labour-run administration to make the speed limit in built-up areas 20mph as an example of the anti-motorist instincts of Starmer\u2019s party. The Tories are likely to claim Labour will roll out the move nationwide, though it has no plans to do so. The move was introduced to reduce deaths and noise and encourage people to walk or cycle. However, it has proved to be a controversial measure and large petitions have been run opposing it. The Tories have previously attempted to attack Labour based on its performance in Wales, including on NHS waiting times.UlezIt was the narrow Tory win in the Uxbridge by-election, largely based on its opposition to the extension of London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), that appears to have led to the new pro-car strategy from Sunak. Despite winning the contest by less than 500 votes, it continues to shape No 10 thinking. Labour\u2019s London mayor Sadiq Khan has continued to defend the policy and with similar schemes being planned in cities across the country, it is another area in which the Tories will seek some electoral advantage. Again, there are trade offs \u2013 even in London, there is significant support for Ulez given concerns about air quality.Low Traffic NeighbourhoodsIn some communities, the presence of low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) has become a new front in the political culture wars. Sunak has already ordered a review of the schemes as he searches for another political wedge to use against Starmer and further appeal to drivers. The prime minister has let it be known he is worried about the proliferation of LTNs in the wake of the Covid pandemic. They are now in places such as Bristol, Oxford, Manchester and Birmingham. They are hated by some drivers, but also have a lot of support where they reduce traffic around schools.",

For every \u20ac1 governments spent building railways, they spent \u20ac1.6 building roads.\u201cThis is a political choice,\u201d said Lorelei Limousin, a climate campaigner with Greenpeace, which commissioned the report. \u201cWe see the consequences today with the climate, but also with people who have been left without an alternative solution to cars.\u201dThe report found the EU, Norway, Switzerland and the UK spent \u20ac1.5tn (\u00a31.29tn) between 1995 and 2018 to extend their roads \u2013 but just \u20ac0.93tn (\u00a30.8tn) to extend their rail networks.In the four years that followed (2018-21), the average gap in investment in rail and road decreased from 66% to 34%. During that time, seven countries invested more in rail than roads \u2013 Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the UK \u2013 while the rest spent more on roads than rail.Dr Giulio Mattioli, a transport researcher at the Technical University of Dortmund, who was not involved in the study, said: \u201cMost European countries have been actually encouraging car use by investing large amounts of public money into expanding motorway infrastructure.\u201dIn the public and political debate, Mattioli added, small investments into bike lanes and railways were heavily scrutinised while investments in roads were taken for granted. \u201cThis absolutely needs to change if we are to meet climate mitigation targets in the transport sector.\u201dThe report found motorways grew most in Ireland, Romania and Poland, and least in Lithuania, Latvia and Belgium. In 15 of the 30 countries studied, the lengths of motorways more than doubled over the 25-year period.European governments have closed about 8,523 miles of regional passenger railway lines since the mid-90s, the study claims. Photograph: Graham Turner/the GuardianAt the same time, the report found, European governments had shut down more than 2,500 train stations since the mid-90s. They also closed about 8,523 miles (13,717 km) of regional passenger railway lines. As a rough estimation, the researchers said, 4536 miles of these lines could be reopened \u201crelatively easily\u201d.The EU plans to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by the end of the decade from 1990 levels but has failed to make any headway in its transport sector. Road transport was responsible for three-quarters of the sector\u2019s emissions in 2020. Only in 2029 will domestic transport emissions drop below 1990 levels, the European Environment Agency found last year. Emissions will continue to rise from planes and ships that travel between the EU and other parts of the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also demanded an end to all new motorways and airports.Limousin said: \u201cTo help people shift from cars to public transport, which is really key to cut the emissions of transport, we need to make the infrastructure fit for that challenge. We need the government to stop closing train lines and stations, reopen those which have been closed and that we can easily reopen \u2026 and massively increase the public funding in real solutions.\u201dA handful of European countries have introduced cheaper public transport tickets to encourage people to shift from cars to trains, trams and buses. In Germany last summer, the government introduced a \u20ac9-a-month ticket for local and regional public transport, which it later raised to \u20ac49 a month.Mattioli said: \u201cThe \u20ac9 and \u20ac49 German tickets have given many the impression that people would shift to public transport if it were cheaper. But levels of service and infrastructure networks are much more important for modal shift. So I think we should be talking less about fares and a lot more about infrastructure.\u201d",

        "text": "The European Union has become the first international body to criminalise wide-scale environmental damage \u201ccomparable to ecocide\u201d.Late on Thursday, lawmakers agreed an update to the bloc\u2019s environmental crime directive punishing the most serious cases of ecosystem destruction, including habitat loss and illegal logging, with tougher penalties.Marie Toussaint, a French lawyer and MEP heading EU efforts to criminalise ecocide, said the decision \u201cmarks the end of impunity for environmental criminals\u201d and could usher in a new age of environmental litigation in Europe.The environmental crime directive will be formally passed in the spring, and member states will then have two years to put it into national law.Although the agreed text does not itself include the word \u201cecocide\u201d, its preamble says it intends to criminalise \u201ccases comparable to ecocide\u201d. These are actions that cause widespread, substantial and irreversible or long-lasting damage to large or important ecosystems, habitats or the quality of air, soil or water.This closely follows a definition of ecocide developed by an international panel of legal experts in 2021. The definition was mainly intended to be adopted by the international criminal court through an amendment to the Rome statute \u2013 the key goal of the Stop Ecocide Foundation \u2013 but is now increasingly being used for national-level legislation. Scotland, for example, recently began consulting on whether to introduce the UK\u2019s first ecocide law.The revised EU law specifies which kinds of environmental activities are covered. These include water abstraction, ship recycling and pollution, the introduction and spread of invasive alien species, and ozone destruction. But it does not say anything about fishing, the export of toxic waste to developing countries or carbon market fraud.Having a permit to carry out listed activities will not automatically be an excuse. Individuals and companies will have committed a crime if that authorisation was obtained fraudulently or by corruption, extortion or coercion, or if it breaches substantive legal requirements.Lawmakers did not agree to extend these obligations to offences committed outside EU borders on behalf of EU companies, but individual member states would be able to choose to do this.The law introduces new penalties, ranging from prison sentences for individuals to exclusion from access to public funds for companies. Member states will also be able to choose whether to introduce fines for companies based on a proportion of their turnover (up to 5% depending on the crime) or fixed amounts of up to \u20ac40m (\u00a335m).Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius, EU commissioner for environment, oceans and fisheries, said environmental crimes were serious, lucrative and on the rise. Annual revenues from the illegal waste market in the EU, for example, ranged between \u20ac4 and \u20ac15bn.\u201cThe EU agreed a new law that recognises their gravity, especially when large ecosystems are destroyed,\u201d said Sinkevi\u010dius. \u201cOur health depends on the state of the environment in which we live, so we must deter criminals willing to destroy ecosystems for profit.\u201dToussaint said the EU had now adopted some of the most ambitious legislation in the world. \u201cIn the European political context, this text is a point of support for all those who defend the environment in court and fight the impunity of criminal firms who too often flout the laws and work today to unravelling environmental democracy in Europe.\u201dThe agreement followed months of negotiation between the Council of the EU, European Commission and parliament, as well as civil society campaigning.Jojo Mehta, co-founder and executive director of Stop Ecocide International, said the updated law would help member states take environmental harms much more seriously. \u201cThis is highly significant and to be wholeheartedly commended, and we can see from the rapidly growing momentum of the ecocide law initiative that European states will not be long in engaging more deeply with it in their own jurisdictions.\u201cIndeed, I have no doubt that with this direction of travel being rapidly established, it is only a matter of time before ecocide is recognised in criminal law at every level.\u201d This article was amended on 20 November 2023 to correct a reference to the European Council, which should have been to the Council of the EU.",

But we can do more \u2013 starting with the streets around us.Jon Burke, a decarbonisation policy consultant, has likened the private motor vehicle to an invasive species. It grows to dominate our transport systems, choking out alternatives, and erodes the diverse social fabric of neighbourhoods. While electric vehicles will reduce climate-changing emissions and exhaust pollution, they will not relieve our congested roads and will not tackle air pollution from tyres, brakes and road wear.Redesigning our villages, towns and cities to favour walking and cycling can help the climate crisis, air pollution and the urban noise that plagues the lives of so many people, as well as improving our health through daily exercise. This goes beyond debates on cycle lanes and low-traffic neighbourhoods. Cities around the globe including Sydney, Portland, Paris and now many in China, are embracing the \u201c15-minute city\u201d. This places shops, schools, health centres and the everyday necessities of life within an easy walk, cycle or public transport trip, reducing the need for car use and home deliveries.Barcelona launches 10-year plan to reclaim city streets from carsRead moreA study from Barcelona\u2019s Institute for Global Health adds to evidence on the benefits from reclaiming the urban space devoted to traffic.Much-quoted research from the 1980s found that recovery from surgery could be helped simply by seeing trees from the hospital window. More recent studies have found that people live longer and have fewer heart problems if they have green spaces in their neighbourhoods. The World Health Organization (WHO) therefore recommends that we have access to 0.5 hectares of public green space \u2013 about two-thirds of a football pitch \u2013 within 300 metres of our homes.The Barcelona researchers looked at satellite images of more than 1,000 European cities. They found that 62% of people were living in areas with less green space than recommended. Meeting the WHO recommendations could prevent 43,000 early deaths a year across 31 European countries studied.Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, who led the research, said: \u201cAny greenery that can be introduced is good: green roofs and vertical gardens, green school yards, green corridors, street trees, park and pocket parks, community gardens and other measures such as rerouting traffic, digging up asphalt and replacing it with green space, across the board.\u201dGlobally more than 50% of people live in cities.

They mean that the budget set in the government\u2019s contracts for difference auction is unlikely to be spent, because many windfarms will not get through the auction, so bills will be kept higher.Despite the fact that the government recently increased the budget for the auction from \u00a3170m to \u00a3190m, analysts at the ECIU said this was likely to make little difference to the outcome of the auction and ignored the fact that renewables were predicted to save customers money.The previous auction round did not meet the budget and previous analysis found that 1GW of wind power was missed out on, along with savings of \u00a3225m a year. The ECIU found that the current auction could secure as little as about 2GW of offshore wind, leading to missed savings of more than \u00a31.5bn a year from cheaper renewable energy, compared with about 7GW that could have been secured.Energy experts have criticised the government for giving tax breaks to oil companies and not allowing windfarms to thrive.Jess Ralston, an energy analyst at the ECIU, said: \u201cThe government seems to be focused on North Sea gas licences and tax breaks for oil companies that won\u2019t bring down bills, while tying up offshore wind farms that generate electricity cheaper than gas in red tape. What is going on?\u201cEven with inflation pushing costs up for offshore wind, it will still generate electricity much cheaper than gas power stations. Stifling windfarms pushes up bills. The Treasury\u2019s rules seem to be actively working against bringing them down.\u201dIf the rules around these auctions were not loosened, the ECIU said, it could put the goal of 50GW of offshore wind by 2030 at risk.A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \u201cWe do not recognise these figures \u2013 last year\u2019s Contracts for Difference scheme auction was the largest ever, issuing contracts to nearly 100 clean tech projects, and we increased this year\u2019s budget to reflect the large volume of eligible applications received.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

She has travelled all over India on birding trips and has, she says, spotted 1,060 of the 1,400 bird species in the country.But it was at home, during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, that she saw an Indian silverbill caught in the protective netting on her balcony, attracting the attention of her cat. Although the bird escaped, some of its feathers were damaged. When Munshi saw the exquisite markings and patterns, she tried to identify the bird, but was struck by how little information there was online.\u201cThough India is rich in bird life, there is very little data on bird species and their feathers,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are collections of birds from before 1970, but after the passing of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, \u2018round skin\u2019 specimens [the traditional method of preserving dead birds] are not allowed, even for scientific research. Those that are in museums, once the wings are folded and dried up, you cannot see the details of individual feathers.\u201d\nFeathers from a red-necked falcon\nIn November 2021, Munshi teamed up with Sherwin Everett, a vet and curator at an avian hospital in Ahmedabad, to launch the Feather Library website recording the details and images of bird feathers. The hospital treats about 2,000 birds a month. Many have been injured in road accidents and collisions, or during kite festivals, when they get caught in the kite strings. While many recover, some die of their injuries.\u201cMost rescue centres throw away the dead birds or burn them, and a lot of valuable data is lost,\u201d Munshi says. \u201cBy collecting these feathers and documenting them digitally, we have a non-invasive way of getting valuable data. Our vision behind creating the feather library was to display the individual feathers of bird species and their markings, patterns, etc so that in the eventuality of their extinction there is a record for future generations.\u201dFeatherLibrary.com is the first online collection of its kind in India. It includes details such as the bird\u2019s weight, body length, beak width, wingspan and number of feathers, as well as where the bird was found.\nAn Indian golden oriole feather, left, and white-throated kingfisher feathers\nPreserving the feathers is a delicate process. The dead birds are kept in a freezer for 48 hours to kill pathogens. Then they are sanitised and measurements taken. The wings and tail are cut, injected with spirit and dried. The feathers are counted and logged as primaries, secondaries, tertials (wing feathers) and rectrices (tail feathers). One wing is fully stretched and the tail fanned in dorsal and ventral views.\nFeathers of a rose-ringed parakeet\n\u201cThere are specimens from more than 110 species, from kingfishers to rose-ringed parakeets,\u201d says Munshi. \u201cSo far, we have permission to obtain specimens only in the state of Gujarat [but] we have applied for permission in other states such as Karnataka, Arunachal Pradesh, Maharashtra and Assam. This library is a valuable resource for everyone from forest officials to birders, researchers, students and those who do feather transplants.\u201dThere are only a few similar initiatives in the world, including Featherbase, an independent library in Germany set up by scientists and collectors, and the Feather Atlas, an image database managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service.\nArchitect Esha Munshi and veterinarian Sherwin Everett, founders of the Feather Library\nMunshi and Everett are adding new features all the time to their library, including CT scans and X-rays of the birds for organ and skeletal data. The archive has collected data on rare species such as the sooty tern, white-throated kingfisher and the Indian skimmer.Having completed a two-year online course in bird biology from Cornell University in the US, Munshi is working with Everett on a newly established charitable trust, with the aim of raising funds to start a laboratory, and perhaps a museum in the future. Until then, they are building the digital library, one feather at a time.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

The \u201carms-length\u201d health check survey of the state\u2019s power sector was still being worked on, the spokesperson said.\u201cOur report is due in early August and the government will consider its response in due course.\u201dThe previous Coalition government had been in talks for about nine months over the future of Eraring prior to Origin\u2019s closure timing announcement in February 2022. Under market rules, a generator is required to declare any plans to shut a major facility three and a half years prior to the exit from the grid.Coalition insiders have said the cost of extending even half of Eraring\u2019s four units beyond 2025 exceeded $300m a year, excluding the cost of the coal. That sum has probably risen further since, and the new Labor government should consider better uses for the spending, they said.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nOrigin, for its part, considered the expense would be compensated at least in part by the revenue the state would glean from selling the power. The company, one of Australia\u2019s biggest energy firms, would also likely be among the customers to serve its own retail customers.Former and serving government officials have also said NSW\u2019s renewable energy road map legislated by the Coalition had the flexibility to be accelerated to reduce the risk of a capacity gap should Eraring close entirely in 2025. A tender process for long-term energy storage in the form of big batteries, for instance, could be expanded.\u201cIf the firming tenders are successful, reliability will be fine,\u201d one person familiar with the process said.That said, Sharpe has held two briefings for the media to underscore the seriousness of the state\u2019s energy security.

Its new owner, Sev.en Global Investments, said in a statement it has advised the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) they plan to keep the coal-fired power station going until 2033.Built in 1978, the 1,320MW plant supplies about a 10th of NSW\u2019s electricity. The government sold it to Delta Energy in 2015 for a $1m, and it was then on-sold last year to the Czech billionaire Pavel Tyka\u010d.\u201cAs the 2029 date draws closer, Delta has been able to estimate plant technical capabilities with a greater level of accuracy,\u201d the company said in the statement.\u201cGiven the uncertainties surrounding the capacity of electricity resources over the next 10 years and the urgent need to maintain system security throughout this period, Delta considers it a responsible step to advise AEMO of the availability of Vales Point Power Station\u2019s capacity,\u201d it said.The Nature Conservation Council of NSW chief executive, Jacqui Mumford, said extending Vales Point \u201cwould make it almost impossible for NSW to reach its emission reduction targets\u201d.\u201cBetween 2017 and 2022 this power plant averaged 6.7m tonnes of carbon emissions per year,\u201d Mumford said. \u201cThat\u2019s equivalent to the emissions from 2.2m cars \u2013 over half the entire passenger vehicle fleet in NSW.\u201d",

But hybrid workers did not reduce their emissions so dramatically, according to the research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.One day of remote work a week reduced emissions by just 2% because energy savings from not being in the office were offset by factors such as an increase in non-commuting travel when working from home. Working remotely two or four days a week reduced an individual\u2019s emissions by up to 29% compared with on-site workers.\u2018Never again\u2019: is Britain finally ready to return to the office?Read moreResearchers from Cornell University and Microsoft used multiple datasets including Microsoft\u2019s own employee data on commuting and teleworking behaviours to model the predicted greenhouse gas emissions of office workers, remote workers and hybrid workers in the US, examining five categories of emissions including office and residential energy use.They found that IT and communications technology had a negligible impact on individuals\u2019 work carbon footprints.The main causes of remote workers\u2019 reduced emissions were less office energy use, as well as fewer emissions from a daily commute.Wider emissions reducing benefits of working from home include the easing of vehicle congestion during rush hour in commuting areas, which is likely to improve fuel economy. But the authors warned that working from home needed to be carefully planned to deliver emissions saving benefits.\u201cPeople say: \u2018I work from home, I\u2019m net zero.\u2019 That\u2019s not true,\u201d said the co-author Fengqi You of Cornell University. \u201cThe net benefit for working remotely is positive but a key question is how positive. When people work remotely, they tend to spend more emissions on social activities.\u201dThe study found that remote workers\u2019 non-work travel increased, with more driving and more flying. You said that homes were not always optimised for decarbonisation, in terms of using renewable energy and the efficiency of appliances, and there were some scale-related energy savings. For instance, a small home printer is likely to be less energy efficient than an office printer.The Covid-19 pandemic created a remote working revolution for many office workers. In the US and elsewhere, many people relocated from \u201chigh-density commuting zones\u201d \u2013 relatively close to major cities and offices \u2013 to more rural \u201clow-density commuting zones\u201d. According to the study, this could result in longer commuting distances for hybrid workers and a greater carbon footprint due to the increased use of private vehicles.The authors said: \u201cWhile remote work shows potential in reducing carbon footprint, careful consideration of commuting patterns, building energy consumption, vehicle ownership, and non-commute-related travel is essential to fully realise its environmental benefits.\u201dWhile the findings do not apply to workers in many sectors \u2013 a bus driver, for example, cannot work from home \u2013 it provides pointers on how office-based employers can reduce company emissions.You said that while the findings were specific to the US, the modelling and trends were likely to be replicated in Europe and Japan. He called on companies to look at energy efficiency measures, downsizing and sharing office space. \u201cBy sharing office space we reduce capacity and size and reduce our office energy consumption,\u201d he said.The study found that IT and communications accounted for a small percentage of overall emissions and therefore emissions reduction should focus on renewables for office heating and cooling, as well as decarbonising commuting.",

Bang in the middle of the row over tweeting by the widely respected Gary Lineker, it now seems to be muzzling the most trusted Briton of them all \u2013 David Attenborough.As the Guardian reports today, it has decided not to broadcast the sixth and last programme of the veteran broadcaster\u2019s widely hailed new series on Britain\u2019s wildlife, in which he exposes its dramatic decline, and what has caused it. While the other five episodes of Wild Isles will go out in prime time, amid enormous hype, it will be available only to those who look for it on the BBC\u2019s iPlayer service.Sources say that the programme, already filmed, and entitled Saving Our Wild Isles, is being suppressed for fear of antagonising rightwing groups with \u201cdinosaur ways\u201d. Its showing, even on iPlayer, has already been attacked in the Daily Telegraph for being partly funded by WWF UK and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, two establishment wildlife groups, which it describes as having a \u201ccampaigning agenda\u201d.This is not the first time that the BBC has effectively silenced its greatest presenter who \u2013 after years of criticism for downplaying the threats to the world\u2019s environment \u2013 has over the past decade become one the most outspoken and influential advocates of action to combat the climate crisis and preserve biodiversity. But it is likely to provoke the most outrage.Polls show that more than four of every five Britons believe that the country\u2019s wildlife is under threat and urgent measures are needed to protect and restore it. Well over half lament their own personal experience of declines in insects, birds, mammals and green space.They \u2013 and Attenborough \u2013 are right. Britain has been officially revealed to be one of the worst countries in the world for the state of its biodiversity, having lost nearly half of it since the industrial revolution. And the government is doing shamefully little to tackle this.As the Guardian reported in January, ministers were accused by their own watchdog \u2013 the Office for Environmental Protection \u2013 of failing to keep their promises to safeguard the country\u2019s natural environment as its wildlife declined at an \u201ceye-watering rate\u201d. Eye-watering is right. Since the 1970s, the UK\u2019s official State of Nature report revealed, 41% of all Britain\u2019s species have declined, while more than a quarter of its mammals are at risk of extinction. The number of farmland birds has been cut in half over that period.00:03:24Cop26: David Attenborough urges leaders to 'turn tragedy into triumph\u2019 \u2013 videoSince the 1950s, more than half of Britain\u2019s native plant species have declined \u2013 just a few days ago they were revealed now to be outnumbered by alien species \u2013 while hedgehogs have crashed by a staggering 95% and turtle doves by 98%. In all Britain has lost more biodiversity than any other G7 nation, and is in the bottom 10% of all countries worldwide.So what, pray, is so unacceptable about allowing Britain\u2019s most respected figure to present these truths on national television, especially when there is already so much appetite for information about the state of Britain\u2019s wildlife among the vast majority of those who pay its licence fee? And what is so frightful about enabling an expert with more than 70 years of accumulated knowledge about nature to suggest solutions?The real David AttenboroughRead moreMind you, this is not the first time that has happened. David Attenborough was long condemned by environmentalists for failing to draw attention to the growing environmental crisis. In part, this was down to his own past reluctance: \u201cI leave advocacy to [David] Bellamy,\u201d he told me during one of our conversations on the issue.But the BBC has also been culpable, partly out of political cowardice, and partly out of greed: a few years back, it feared that if Attenborough mentioned climate change, for example, that would inhibit overseas sales, especially in the US.Back in 2006, an article in the Radio Times gave the game away, after criticism of the failure of his epic Planet Earth to highlight that the species it featured were being endangered. \u201cThe series grinds no political axe,\u201d it explained, \u201cas no programme hoping to sell to 100 countries can hope to do.\u201d Miles Barton, a longstanding Attenborough producer, once described the anxiety: \u201cThe more preachy you are, the lower the numbers are going to be.\u201dThe BBC is no stranger to timidity, of course. Way back in 1992, Michael Grade attacked its \u201cenervating caution\u201d. But this is of a different order. Putting caution above conservation on a crucial issue of such public concern would be a sad new low.\nGeoffrey Lean is a specialist environment correspondent and author\n",

This gives the centre-left the option to either continue governing with the Greens and the left-wing Die Linke, or form a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d with the second-placed conservatives.Support for the German Greens, who have been in government at national level since December 2021, slid to 11.7%, down 5.6 percentage points compared with state elections in 2019, providing another sobering moment for the environmentalist party after an underwhelming result at Berlin\u2019s repeat state elections in February.With only 475,500 eligible voters, the election in Germany\u2019s smallest state is not considered a bellwether poll. Bovenschulte\u2019s personality ratings played a strong role in the SPD\u2019s strong showing, and national Green party leaders on Monday attributed their poor performance down to \u201clocal mistakes\u201d.A month before the vote, Bremen\u2019s Green transport senator, Maike Schaefer, had provoked local ire by scrapping the so-called \u201cbread-roll button\u201d in one of the city\u2019s districts, a short-term free parking option at parking ticket machines designed to give locals just enough time to pop into a high-street bakery. On Monday, Schaefer announced she was stepping down from her post and retiring from politics.Parallels between the votes in Bremen and Berlin, however, will trouble the Green\u2019s leadership.

        "text": "The northern \u201cbreadbasket\u201d of Afghanistan is battling a potentially devastating outbreak of locusts that threaten to eat their way through up to a quarter of the country\u2019s annual wheat harvest, the UN has warned.After three years of disappointing, drought-afflicted harvests, Afghan farmers were expecting better this year \u2013 a much-needed boost for a country where nearly 20 million people are thought to be at the highest risk of famine in 25 years.But for those in eight key agricultural provinces, mostly in the north and north-east, the large-scale outbreak of Moroccan locusts will probably be \u201cdevastating\u201d, according to Richard Trenchard, the UN\u2019s food and agriculture organisation (FAO) country representative.The FAO estimates that a full outbreak of the Moroccan locust, one of the most economically damaging plant pests in the world, could result in crop losses of between 700,000 and 1.2m tonnes of wheat, the country\u2019s staple grain.Compounding the deep economic crisis that gripped Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover in August 2021, the locusts threatened further misery this year and next, said Trenchard.\u201cThis year they were looking at good harvests, and it was like the first time they were seeing a bit of recovery, and just getting back almost to normal. And, in this area, it\u2019s probably going to be \u2013 for many, many farmers \u2013 devastating,\u201d he said.\u201cIn other areas it will be good, but in this area, the breadbasket, it\u2019s just \u2026 something that breaks my heart.\u201dAfghanistan has had two brushes with the Moroccan locust in recent history, one in 1981, when an outbreak wiped out about a quarter of the national harvest, and another in 2003, when it claimed a more modest 8% due to a strengthened locust-control programme.However, since the Taliban overthrew Ashraf Ghani\u2019s government, prompting foreign assistance to be cut off, the agriculture ministry\u2019s locust-control programme has foundered. This has left the country vulnerable, as the Moroccan locust is ever present and only requires certain conditions for an outbreak to occur.People in Baghlan province, northern Afghanistan, use the traditional control method of digging pits to bury adolescent locusts before they grow into adults. Photograph: Hashim Azizi/FAOSince noticing early last month that their fields were starting to become carpeted with locusts, communities in affected areas such as Badakhshan, Sar-e Pul and Kunduz provinces have mobilised to use traditional methods to kill the pests.Thousands of people, many supported by FAO, were now engaged in the \u201cbackbreaking\u201d work of trying to sweep groups of adolescent locusts, known as hopper bands, into trenches or tarpaulins to be buried, said Trenchard.The effort is thought to have averted the worst-case scenario of up to 1.7m tonnes of lost wheat. But its scope was limited, said Trenchard, warning that for many it would be \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d.\u201cYou kill millions of locusts that way. The problem is there are billions of locusts,\u201d he said.Already, pistachio orchards have reportedly been devastated in north-western Badghis province. In the past week two areas have reported the emergence of the first adult locusts, which means that within the next six weeks the insects will start to swarm, with each swarm lasting for four to eight weeks. The harvest is also due to start in three weeks.Farmers, local aid organisations, the FAO and the agriculture ministry were now in a race to kill as many hoppers as possible before they turn into adults and swarm, said Trenchard. But this is to mitigate the impact, rather than remove the threat.UN ready for \u2018heartbreaking\u2019 decision to pull out of AfghanistanRead more\u201c[The outbreak] will have a significant impact. There is no doubt,\u201d said Trenchard. \u201cHow big that impact is \u2026 you won\u2019t tell until they start swarming and [see] where they go.\u201dThe Moroccan locust consumes about 150 different plant species, 50 of them food crops, and all of which grow in Afghanistan. Its swarms can cover up to 150 miles (250km) a day.The adolescent locusts, or hoppers, are buried in pits. It\u2019s a race to get rid of as many as possible before they turn into adults and swarm. Photograph: Hashim Azizi/FAOIt also laid far more eggs than most locusts, said Trenchard. \u201cYou tend to get a multiplier of about 10 from one year to the next. So 2024 is more worrying than 2023: 2023 is bad, but 2024 is when \u2013 if it\u2019s not controlled \u2013 we will see something really awful.\u201dTo avoid that, he said, FAO urgently needed more funding to ensure that everything was in place for chemical treatment to be deployed from September. Food assistance delivered through the World Food Programme \u2013 which has been reduced this year \u2013 must be maintained, he added.According to the UN, its 2023 Afghanistan humanitarian response plan, which is seeking $4.6bn (\u00a33.65bn) for urgent needs in the country, has so far only received $303m \u2013 6.6% of the total funding required.",

        "text": "Artificial rain has been used in an attempt to lower pollution levels in Lahore, Pakistan.The capital city of the eastern province of Punjab, near the Indian border, has some of the worst air quality in the world and has become extremely polluted because of a growing population of more than 13 million people.By early December, the air quality in the city had grown so bad that schools, markets and parks were closed for four days. By last weekend, the city\u2019s air quality index (AQI) had reached levels considered extremely hazardous to health.To try to reduce them, on Saturday the Punjab government used cloud seeding to create rain in 10 locations around the city using a small Cessna plane.To create the clouds, there needs to be enough moisture already present in the clouds in the lower atmosphere. In summer, common table salt mixed with water is sprayed over the cloud patches from planes. After a few hours, the mist integrates with the clouds and produces rain. In winter, the clouds are seeded using flakes of silver iodide, which can be fired from a vehicle or a plane.The practice, also known as \u201cblueskying\u201d, has been used to induce precipitation in several countries in the Middle East, as well as China and India.Bilal Afzal, the provincial caretaker minister for the environment, said the cloud seeding had been a success, but admitted rainfall was \u201cscanty\u201d as the cloud quality was not very good. Nevertheless, Lahore\u2019s air quality improved with just a few millimetres of rain, dropping from an AQI of more than 300 to 189, Afzal said. However, the benefits lasted only a couple of days before pollution returned to its previous level.The exercise did not cause any significant disruption. \u201cI just got a spatter on my car while driving home from the clinic around 3pm and thought it was bird droppings,\u201d said Zaeema Naeem, a doctor in Lahore.Afzal said the authorities planned to carry out cloud seeding regularly during the smog season. \u201cIf we can clean our air at the cost of fuel for one small plane, the exercise would be well worth it,\u201d he said. It would, however, mean buying or renting a small plane. As for emissions from it, he said these would amount only to the equivalent of two or three cars running for about four hours.However, climate experts warned the effects of the cloud seeding could be unpredictable. Malik Amin Aslam, a former environment minister, said that once rain was triggered it might be difficult to arrest it. \u201cThe stoppage of that rain burst is dictated by nature,\u201d he said.Dr Ghulam Rasul warned that \u201coverdose may lead to hailstorm or torrential rain\u201d. The head of the climate change programme at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and a former director general of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, he said that while it might provide temporary relief from smog, it was not a sustainable solution and could create very dry conditions, possibly causing fog and smog to become even more persistent.Aslam agreed that the government needed \u201cto study the consequences of tampering with nature and use this tool very sparingly; it\u2019s like using steroids as a last-ditch effort to break the cycle of unliveable smog\u201d. Such solutions, he added, could take the focus away from addressing the \u201cactual sources of smog, like transport, industries emissions, crop and waste burning and disappearing green cover\u201d.He said the transport industry was responsible for 50% of emissions in Lahore, adding that the government was trying its best to tackle it.Fehmeda Khan, a local doctor, has observed a threefold increase among patients complaining of respiratory tract diseases and allergies owing to dust. She advised residents: \u201cClose your windows to avoid dirty outdoor air, avoid going out and wear a mask if you do; and make nasal saline rinses morning and night as a daily regimen.\u201d",

Their larvae have to feed on, and then overwinter in, the dead stems of the old-fashioned meadow grasses like couch, cock\u2019s-foot, Yorkshire fog, foxtail, fescues, soft brome, timothy, uncle Tom Cobley and all. About 98% of such meadows have disappeared since 1945, but we are lucky to own eight acres that have not been a working farm since before the second world war, so have never been reseeded with modern foreign species.

Since then it has been recorded along the Wales-England border and westwards.UK butterfly numbers bounce back after last year\u2019s all-time lowRead moreUnlike the small skipper, the tips of its antennae look like they have been dipped in black ink, like matchsticks, and the wings (top pair held dart-like at 45 degrees) have a broader white and brown border. But why do some insects spread and not others? Research by Butterfly Conservation in Clocaenog Forest, a few miles south, showed that small pearl\u2011bordered fritillaries stayed within less than a mile of their breeding place for years until their population reached a density that changed their behaviour, and they flew three or four miles to start a new colony. New research also shows that greater coverage of larval foodplants on a local scale aids population growth and the energy to spread. This will all help us understand how to aid our dwindling pollinators. Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",

Orcas are highly intelligent and incredibly behaviourally complex.\u201cBut they have never killed one of us in the wild.

It produced millions of camera images, which researchers analysed to see how human activity has affected 159 mammal species in 16 protected areas across tropical regions on three continents. The camera traps across 1,000 sites collected images over up to 10 years across tropical forests.Cameras were stationed in protected areas including Bwindi impenetrable national park in Africa, Yasun\u00ed national park in South America and Pasoh forest reserve in south-east Asia.Researchers found that some animals were particularly badly affected by habitat fragmentation caused by deforestation. Specialist species, which use specific habitats only, thrived when habitat fragmentation \u2013 that is, losing parts of habitat around, but not necessarily in, a protected area \u2013 is low.Generalists do better in more diverse habitats where they have a range of different types of food and shelter. \u201cHabitats are more varied at the edge of a protected area,\u201d Semper-Pascual explained.The edge of the habitat changes from a dense tropical forest to open agricultural land, and this can give a more diverse habitat than in the depths of the forest. The flipside of this is that animals attracted to the edge of the habitat, near humans, are more vulnerable to being hunted either to protect farm animals or for products such as meat or fur.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Photograph: Richard Earp/English Heritage\u201cThink of all the quotes throughout Shakespeare of the flowers that were common \u2026 these aren\u2019t extraordinary things,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are things that would have been common that are now unusual so it is exciting to have the opportunity to bring back a diverse ordinary.\u201cIf we get that diversity back with the plants, then it will attract insects and the butterflies that then attracts the amphibians and the birds and other mammals. The lark can sing again over a site that hasn\u2019t had a lark on it \u2026 it\u2019s that sort of thing about it which is, I think, wonderful.\u201dEnglish Heritage has partnered with Plantlife, Europe\u2019s largest charity dedicated to saving wildlife and fungi. Watkins said a key component of the initiative was involving and engaging with communities around each meadow site.Different approaches will be made at different sites to make sure, among other things, that locally specific wildflowers are introduced.Some meadows will be new ones, others enhanced, like the meadow which a team has already started to establish at Barnard Castle in County Durham \u2013 a crumbling 12th-century fortress which saw a record rise in visitor numbers after the town gained notoriety as the destination of Dominic Cummings on a lockdown mission to test his eyesight.Visitors to St Mary\u2019s Church in Kempley in the Forest of Dean should this weekend still see a locally native daffodil that was once far more prevalent. The plan there is to encourage the increase of the daffodils and other grassland wildflowers.Whitby Abbey in North Yorkshire.

        "text": "The controversial concept of purposely deflecting the sun\u2019s rays to cool down an overheating Earth should be further studied, according to a group of scientists headed by James Hansen, the renowned former Nasa climate researcher.An open letter from more than 60 scientists across the US, Canada and Europe warns that it is \u201cincreasingly unlikely\u201d the world will remain below 2C of heating beyond pre-industrial times, due to a failure to slash greenhouse gas emissions, requiring a \u201crigorous, rapid scientific assessment\u201d of previously outlandish proposals for solar geoengineering to provide rapid cooling.The letter\u2019s signatories include Hansen, the veteran climate scientist credited with alerting the world to the dangerous escalation of global temperature in the 1980s. While they make clear that cutting emissions is the primary priority, the scientists argue that the full ramifications of the geoengineering, also called solar radiation management (SRM), needs to be understood before it is tried in desperation by a country.\u201cSince decisions on whether or not to implement SRM are likely to be considered in the next one to two decades, a robust international scientific assessment of SRM approaches is needed as rapidly as possible,\u201d the letter states.There are a range of different potential climate interventions to try to artificially curb global heating, such as the brightening of clouds to make them more reflective of sunlight, but the option considered most likely by scientists is the spraying of aerosol particles, such as sulphur, into the stratosphere.These particles would deflect the sun\u2019s rays and rapidly cool the planet, by 1C or maybe even more, although they would only linger temporarily, requiring a constant series of trips by aircraft to spray more aerosols and replenish the reflective material.The basic mechanism behind this is well understood \u2013 volcanic eruptions similarly cause sunlight to dim \u2013 but solar geoengineering has never been tested fully and faced severe opposition when this has been attempted, due to fears of unknown environmental knock-on impacts and concerns over the lack of governance surrounding the practice.However, with governments still failing to cut emissions quickly enough to avoid disastrous climate change, support has among some powerful entities to research, if not fully deploy, solar geoengineering. The US government has already kicked off a research review of climate interventions and, on Monday, the United Nations\u2019 Environment Programme (Unep) also released a report calling for further study of the options.The report states that spraying reflective particles \u201cis the only known approach that could be used to cool the Earth within a few years\u201d and that it would cost tens of billions of dollars a year, ongoing, to achieve a 1C reduction in global temperatures.But it also acknowledges a long list of potential dangers, such as damage to the ozone layer, possible power imbalances and conflicts between countries and the risk of \u201ctermination shock\u201d, whereby a sudden halt of spraying the particles would unleash a burst of pent-up global heating.\u201cMake no mistake: there are no quick fixes to the climate crisis,\u201d wrote Inger Andersen, executive director of Unep, in the report\u2019s foreword. \u201cYet current efforts remain insufficient. As a result, increasing voices are calling for and preparing alternative \u2018emergency\u2019 options to keep global temperature rise in check.\u201dAndersen wrote there is little research on the large-scale adoption of solar geoengineering and that it is \u201cfraught with scientific uncertainties and ethical issues\u201d. This \u201cspeculative technology\u201d should not be a considered a substitute for cutting emissions and does not remove carbon from the atmosphere, merely masking the warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels, she added.Opponents of solar geoengineering said it was concerning to see the apparent momentum gathering behind its progress and urged governments to follow the lead of Mexico, which recently banned experiments of the technology. More than 400 scientists have put their name to a document calling for a solar geoengineering non-use agreement.\u201cThere are definitely a handful of proponents actively pushing for a normalization of solar geoengineering as a climate response option [and] a few serious scientists who are coming to this from a point of despair,\u201d said Lili Fuhr, deputy director of climate and energy at the Center for International Environmental Law.\u201cThe idea that we could take control of the global thermostat and dial down temperature levels to a desired state has been debunked by the scientific community again and again. But it is a very attractive idea for big polluters and governments who are unwilling to invest in the radical system change transformation that is so urgently needed.\u201d",

As it grows stronger, scientists fear it will raise the risk in some countries of hunger, drought and malaria.Coupled with hotter global temperatures from burned fossil fuels, the shift could make a host of heat-related dangers worse, from heart disease to suicide.\u201cHeat is unambiguously dangerous,\u201d said Gregory Wellenius, head of the centre for climate and health at Boston university\u2019s school of public health. \u201cSometimes it leads to hospitalisation, other times it leads to death. Then there\u2019s indirect impacts that follow up on that.\u201dEl Ni\u00f1o is the result of natural shifts in winds and ocean temperatures. It brings heavier floods to some parts of the planet while drying others out. The last major El Ni\u00f1o was in 2016, which was the hottest year on record.Because scientists know that weather patterns have changed this year, people and governments can better prepare in the regions affected.\u201cEl Ni\u00f1o does not mean more disasters globally than in any other years,\u201d said Walter Baethgen, a scientist at Columbia university\u2019s international research institute for climate and society. \u201cWhat it does change is our ability to predict what the climate will be in some parts of the world. That\u2019s going to help us take anticipatory actions.\u201dA particular worry is the effect on food security. Shocks to weather patterns could be fatal for farmers in countries already reeling from the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and extreme weather events made worse by the climate crisis.\u201cTo be realistic, many countries do not have many degrees of freedom,\u201d said Baethgen, referring to their ability to stave off hunger they know is coming. But other actors such as the UN and the World Food Programme can use the information to prepare, he added. \u201cThey know in El Ni\u00f1o years some areas will have an increased threat of food insecurity.\u201dIn Ethiopia, for instance, El Ni\u00f1o typically spells drought in the north of the country, said Madeleine Thomson, head of climate impacts and adaptation at the charity Wellcome. On top of that, there may be a greater risk of infectious diseases. \u201cPeople who live at high altitude are not normally exposed to malaria because it\u2019s basically too cool for transmission.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen from historical data that when you have an El Ni\u00f1o, you tend to get an increase in transmission in areas in the highlands where the populations are not immune, so they\u2019re at risk.\u201dThe combination of global heating and El Ni\u00f1o has led to a flurry of temperature records being broken in recent weeks. Before the month was up, the WMO declared July 2023 the hottest month on record.Greenhouse gases, which have clogged up the atmosphere and heated the planet 1.2C since the Industrial Revolution, drove up the temperatures of deadly heatwaves in July in North America, southern Europe andeast Asia, according to the World Weather Attribution network.\u201cWe\u2019re venturing into uncharted territory,\u201d said Chris Hewitt, head of climate services at the WMO. \u201cAs it gets warmer and warmer, the impacts are likely to get worse.\u201dFor that reason, he added, it was important to stop the planet heating and keep temperature rise \u201cas low as possible\u201d. \u201cEvery increment increases the risk,\u201d he said.",

It is worse than bad in China; it is catastrophic, with 20 killed in the worst rainfall in 140 years, since records began. And in the UK, there is harvest havoc to worry farmers, plus a very real danger that the insular and idiotic will point to a persistently, dramatically wet summer that is probably linked to the climate crisis as the opposite: a sign that everything is fine, really, so let\u2019s celebrate with more North Sea drilling.I am sorry, too, for anyone who needs a summer fix of vitamin D, light and warmth to maintain their health and equanimity. I am on record as being fairly anti-summer, and that remains true, but I am not implacably opposed to a bit of balmy weather. I don\u2019t want to go all \u201csome of my best friends are balls of incandescent gas\u201d on you, but I am attempting to grow some tomatoes this year and I have a hammock. I wouldn\u2019t say no to some sun now and then.For all that, I can\u2019t deny it: my water butt runneth over (literally). To me, grey, wet, leaden summer days feel retro, like a Swizzels Double Dip sherbet or a packet of Smiths Salt \u2019n\u2019 Shake with the blue sachet of salt, both snacks I definitely ate in a damp cagoule as rain lashed down on (and probably into) my dad\u2019s car.A washout summer is a portal to so many childhood memories: I can\u2019t remember a single holiday that wasn\u2019t dominated by pewter skies and poor visibility, and every time I come in and have to wipe my glasses, change my socks and put on a jumper, I conjure them up. I remember the sensation of an overlong wet fringe being whipped, stinging with salt, into my face and mouth, on Filey beach in a gale. Whole weeks of that fine, all-enveloping, immersive rain, leavened only by the prospect of persuading a wet donkey to be stroked, somewhere down a muddy lane. The classic sight of, well, nothing at all out of a draughty Yorkshire Dales cottage window, as a determined front of horizontal rain settles over the valley.Partly what I liked, as a constitutionally idle child, was the rain-stopping-play aspect. I remember the jubilation when a planned trudge up a vertical bog was replaced by an afternoon in the pub, a cake in a doily-filled and horse-brass-heavy tearoom with fogged-up windows, or a trip to the Derwent Pencil Museum in Keswick. I remember the low-key glee of eating sweets and reading comics in bed, the spectacular scenery of various beauty spots lost in the gloom, unmourned by me, outside. On one epic school natural history field trip, the campsite got so flooded we had to spend a whole day in a Northumberland chip shop rather than fossil-hunting: truly a result for a gang of 15-year-olds. That sense of being absolved from doing stuff by the weather feels like welcome respite if you\u2019re not the summer fun type.This weather feels like respite, too; it\u2019s basically the UK getting off relatively lightly for once. I\u2019m really enjoying seeing green, rather than crispy yellow and brown, out of the window and, when there is a break in the clouds, I happily watch blackbirds hunting for worms in the soft earth. But it\u2019s a very 2023 type of enjoyment, tinged with all the normal 2023 stuff: guilt, unease and a sense of catastrophe only deferred. We are warned of a possible 30% increase in \u201cuncomfortably hot\u201d days in the UK soon.Some idle Googling reveals that, astonishingly, Swizzels Double Dip and Salt \u2019n\u2019 Shake crisps still exist in some form, probably propped up by adult nostalgia. It is nice to pretend, briefly, that the cool and relatively carefree summers of my childhood do, too. Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnist",

On Wednesday, Bago, north-east of Yangon, reached 42.2C, matching an all-time record previously recorded in May 2020 and April 2019, according to Maximiliano Herrera, a climatologist and weather historian.There had been \u201cendless record heat in south-east Asia, with weeks of records falling every day,\u201d said Herrera.In Thailand last weekend the authorities advised people in Bangkok and other areas of the country to stay home to avoid becoming ill. Temperatures hit 42C in the capital on Saturday, and the heat index \u2013 meaning what the temperature feels like combined with humidity \u2013 reached 54C.Many still braved the sticky weather \u2013 sheltering under umbrellas and carrying fans to stay cool, or seeking respite in air-conditioned malls. In some areas, water has been sprinkled from apartment or university buildings, to ease temperatures and air pollution caused by seasonal agricultural burning.Severe heatwave engulfs Asia causing deaths and forcing schools to closeRead moreRain on Wednesday in Bangkok brought respite from the heat, and the authorities have said they believe the hot season has now peaked.The hot weather has contributed to record electricity consumption in Thailand, with the country consuming more than 39,000 megawatts on 6 April \u2013 higher than the previous record of 32,000 megawatts in April last year.In the Philippines, managing the heat is a particular challenge because the school calendar shifted during the pandemic, meaning students now spend the hottest months of the year in their classrooms. Hundreds of schools have switched to distance learning to prevent students from falling ill, while one teacher\u2019s group has called for shorter teaching times and smaller class sizes to ease conditions.Last month, more than 100 students were treated in hospital in Laguna, south-east of Manila, due to dehydration after taking part in a fire drill when temperatures were between 39C and 42C. Globally, 2022 ranked as one of the hottest years on recorded, and the past eight years were collectively the hottest documented by modern science. It is believed that a return of the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon this year will cause temperatures to rise even further. \u201cThe poorest of the poor are going to [suffer] the most. Especially, it is devastating for the farming community, the people who are dependent on agriculture or fishing,\u201d said Dr Fahad Saeed, regional lead for South Asia and the Middle East at Climate Analytics, a climate science policy institute.\u201cThe heat is not foreign to this part of land,\u201d he said, but added that temperatures were rising beyond the limits of people\u2019s adaptability.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

That figure, experts said, was likely to be far below the true number, since many dead birds in the densely packed cliff colonies would have fallen into the sea.Thousands of seabirds are returning to the islands and the positive cases have left rangers braced for a repeat of last year.Harriet Reid, lead ranger for the islands, said: \u201cSadly, with confirmed cases there is a strong likelihood that we will see thousands of birds affected by the virus again this year.\u201dMany of the bird species on the islands are rare or struggling because of the climate crisis.\u201cBy restricting access to the islands for visitors and limiting disturbance \u2013 which can cause distress to sick birds and potentially increase the transmission of bird flu \u2013 we hope to give the birds the best chance of survival,\u201d said Reid.National Trust has been caring for the islands, home to about 200,000 seabirds annually, for nearly a century. There are no records, the trust said, of anything so potentially damaging to the already endangered colonies.Ben McCarthy, the head of nature conservation at the National Trust, said the impact of avian flu on the wild birds was \u201cunprecedented\u201d, with the high density of colonies making birds visiting the Farne Islands more susceptible.\u201cWe are working with partners to investigate measures to mitigate the impacts as well as better understand the long-term impacts of this pernicious disease,\u201d he said.The islands are also home to one of England\u2019s largest grey seal colonies. To see them, the public will have to use companies such as Billy Shiel Farne Island boats, which has been operating trips since 1918.Rachel Shiel, from the firm, said people could still see the birds and seals at close quarters. She added: \u201cThese trips provide a fantastic vantage of the fabulous Farne Islands without disturbing the important work being undertaken by the National Trust to monitor and protect the wildlife.\u201d",

But in a summary ruling, Amsterdam district court said protests could continue around the ship, although it ruled that Greenpeace\u2019s climbers had to come down or the organisation would face fines of \u20ac50,000 a day.Both sides have claimed victory in the case. Greenpeace called the ruling \u201ca massive setback for the deep sea mining industry\u201d. It also lashed out at The Metals Company, claiming it \u201chas never been interested in scrutiny and they can\u2019t stand that Greenpeace is watching and opposing them at every turn\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But today\u2019s report, by rural charity the CPRE, reveals that parks, public spaces and small areas of trees in more deprived areas are less likely to be officially protected.\u2018We\u2019re a thorn in their side\u2019: the battle over green space in London\u2019s estatesRead moreBrad Taylor, lead author on the report, said: \u201cCommunities with high levels of deprivation need to have their voices heard and their local green spaces protected.\u201dHe said people must be empowered to engage in the local and neighbourhood planning process that can secure official local green space designations, which mean the land cannot be built upon.Two-hour \u2018dose\u2019 of nature significantly boosts health\u00a0\u2013 studyRead moreThere is a growing body of evidence highlighting the importance of access to green spaces not just for wildlife and biodiversity, but for a host of physical and mental health benefits. Green spaces also help protect against flooding and heatwaves.Local green space (LGS) designations were introduced in 2012 to give green belt-like protections to smaller areas of land that are often identified by communities themselves. Since then, 7,286 LGS areas have been established for reasons including their recreational value, beauty and importance for wildlife.Today\u2019s report found that 711 new local green spaces have been designated since 2022, the majority in northern England. In London, the total number grew by 64%.But while designations have increased in deprived areas, CPRE mapping reveals that a strong correlation persists between deprivation and lack of green space.The study looked at four areas in detail: Blackpool, which has high levels of deprivation and no LGS designations. Hull, one of the few local authorities with no LGS designations despite having many green spaces. Shropshire, where LGS designations for school playing fields have played a part in rejuvenating rural areas and providing young people with much-needed opportunities to socialise. London, where a community garden designated as an LGS has boosted academic performance and enabled young people to connect with nature.CPRE is calling for the LGS designation process to be standardised to make it easier for communities to make use of the legislation.Taylor said: \u201cOur green spaces are there for everyone to enjoy \u2013 everyone needs to be involved in deciding how to protect them.\u201d",

In the paper, published in Nature Communications, researchers describe them as \u201camongst the most problematic invasive species in the world\u201d.\u201cOur study sheds light on the predatory habits of one of the world\u2019s most successful and widely distributed invasive predators,\u201d the researchers, led by Christopher Lepczyk from Auburn University in the US, wrote in the paper.Birds, mammals, insects, and reptiles are all on the menu, 17% of which are of conservation concern according to the research, which is the first to quantify their diet on a global scale.In total, cats eat 981 species of bird, 463 reptiles and 431 mammals \u2013 comprising about 90% of species consumed. They were also found to feed on 119 species of insects and 57 amphibians.Cats are particularly damaging on islands, where they eat three times the number of species of conservation concern compared to what they eat on continents. For example, they are known to have eaten species that are now extinct in the wild, including New Zealand\u2019s Stephens Island Rockwren and the New Zealand quail.Their impact on wildlife has spurred fierce debate in New Zealand, where one politician is campaigning to eradicate them completely, and controversy has erupted over competitions encouraging children to shoot feral cats.In the German town of Walldorf, people have been ordered to keep their cats locked inside during spring in order to protect an endangered population of crested larks. Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyIn Australia alone, cats are estimated to kill more than 300 million animals every year, with conservation groups calling for cats to be kept indoors. Some places have implemented feline lockdowns. In the south-western German town of Walldorf, people have been ordered to keep their cats locked inside for three months in spring to protect an endangered population of crested larks, which breed at that time.Previous research has found there is a \u201cconsiderable blind spot\u201d when it comes to acting on the \u201clarge-scale negative impacts\u201d of domestic cats on native wildlife.The study found about 9% of known birds, 6% of known mammals, and 4% of known reptile species are eaten by cats \u2013 and they are not fussy snackers. \u201cCats are largely eating what is present,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cIf a species is missing in the diet analysis it is likely that the prey is either absent or rare in the surrounding environment\u201d.The scientists reached these figures by trawling through hundreds of existing studies. They believe their final estimates are conservative, and will grow as more research is done. Their study looked at free-ranging domestic cats. Some of the larger animals included in the total count might be scavenged by cats, not necessarily caught as prey.A spokesperson from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) said: \u201cFitting bells to quick-release collars and keeping cats inside overnight are simple ways to reduce the number of wild birds and other wildlife that they catch. Ultrasonic devices can also be a harmless but effective way to reduce the amount of time cats spend in gardens.Rock climbers like to connect with nature \u2013 but are they also destroying it?Read more\u201cBeyond gardens, cat predation can cause particular problems for vulnerable and restricted populations of birds, in particular birds that nest low to or on the ground,\u201d the spokesperson said.\u201cIt can also be an issue for birds that have evolved on islands where terrestrial predators would not naturally occur. So, it\u2019s a good idea to limit new residential developments being built too close to important sites for ground-nesting birds, and reduce or remove feral cat populations on islands where they do not belong.\u201dMike Toms from the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), who was not involved in the study, said it provided \u201ca welcome and much-needed global assessment of the impacts that free-ranging cats have on wildlife\u201d.He said: \u201cThat [the study] highlights areas of particular concern \u2013 such as the impacts of cats on island populations \u2013 will help conservation action to be directed to where it is most needed.\u201d Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features",

However, in April it announced a \u00a315bn investment plan to upgrade its factories and launch electric versions its models, starting with the Range Rover.JLR already sells electric cars, but its award-winning battery electric Jaguar I-Pace model has been built in Austria by contract manufacturer Magna Steyr since 2018.In the following five years, JLR\u2019s rivals have launched a series of luxury sports utility vehicles (SUVs) such as BMW\u2019s iX and Mercedes-Benz\u2019s EQC, which compete against Tesla\u2019s Model X.The electric Range Rover is being manufactured in JLR\u2019s factory in Solihull, near Birmingham, using many of the same tools as the existing Range Rovers, which are hybrids that combine smaller batteries with a petrol engine. The shared tooling will allow JLR to shift between electric and petrol hybrid versions more quickly if its plans change.Batteries and electric drive units will be assembled at JLR\u2019s plant in Wolverhampton.The company has not confirmed the price of the electric Range Rover, and customers are registering to gain the option to purchase one when they become available. Prices for the diesel mild hybrid Range Rover start at \u00a3103,000.Geraldine Ingham, managing director for Range Rover, said the model was \u201cseeing the highest levels of client demand in our 53-year history\u201d. The car is undergoing hot- and cold-weather testing in Dubai and Sweden.JLR said the car will come with 800-volt charging, which allows much faster charging speeds when using the network of ultra-rapid chargers that are generally located on main roads and motorways for longer journeys. The company also said the Range Rover would be its quietest model, taking advantage of more efficient electric motors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Widespread mass bleaching of corals on the reef \u2013 caused by rising ocean temperatures \u2013 was first seen in 1998, and happened again in 2002, 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2022.",

        "text": "The revelation should anger all who care about England\u2019s rivers and beaches. Two decades ago, ministers were warned about private equity firms buying up water companies. In a briefing prepared for Britain\u2019s competition regulator prior to the takeover of Southern Water, researchers raised the alarm that private equity-owned water companies would become \u201cimpossible\u201d to regulate. Despite the 20-year transparency rule, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has not released the briefing. Its existence was uncovered by this newspaper. Though its full contents remain secret, its implications are clear: ministers were alerted to the devastating impact that this industry could have on England\u2019s water supply, but they chose not to act.Since then, a tide of effluent has polluted England\u2019s rivers. Following the privatisation of water companies in 1989, owners have enriched themselves while neglecting infrastructure and dumping vast quantities of untreated sewage. As investors have loaded water companies with debt, they have continued to pay dividends to their shareholders, which totalled \u00a31.4bn last year. The public, meanwhile, have shouldered the costs. Water bills have risen. Last week, the industry apologised for these sewage spills and pledged to invest \u00a310bn in infrastructure \u2013 to be paid for by increases in customer bills. Ruth Kelly, the former Labour cabinet minister who is head of the industry\u2019s trade body, Water UK, said more should have been done to address the spillages. She was silent on the subject of dividend payments.The main line of defence for consumers is supposed to be Ofwat. Yet water companies have run rings around the regulator. Its rules are premised on a version of capitalism that no longer exists. When it was founded in 1989, England\u2019s water suppliers were listed on the stock market, allowing anybody to buy shares in this public resource. Today, most of them have been bought up by investment funds that do not face the same disclosure requirements. Opacity has shielded their finances from scrutiny. Since 2015, water companies have been required to demonstrate their \u201cfinancial resilience\u201d, and Ofwat will now prevent negligent ones from paying out dividends. But the horse has already bolted, and many of the firms responsible for loading these companies with debt have already moved on.The regulation of England\u2019s water suppliers is grounded in the illusion that it is possible to promote competition in a marketplace of natural monopolies. A narrow focus on competition and prices has led Ofwat to largely ignore other crucial issues such as the environment and the cost to taxpayers, and to overlook the risks posed by financial engineering. In 2007, for example, it credulously took the view that firms\u2019 capital structures (and by implication their dividend payments) \u201care essentially a matter for companies and the markets\u201d. Meanwhile, the CMA, which has been urged to do more to prevent private equity buyouts, has no remit to investigate these issues. Neither regulator was designed with this industry in mind, and both now find themselves outmanoeuvred by its tricks.Solving these problems requires change from the top. There are two main options for improving England\u2019s spectacularly broken system: empower regulators to restrict financial engineering and prevent companies that load firms with debt from entering this market, or nationalise the water supply. The government seems unwilling to do either.",

It calls for the EU to build the capacity by 2030 to extract materials meeting at least 10% of its demand and process materials meeting 50% of its demand, with a clause allowing for up to 20% of new processing capacity to come from partnerships with emerging markets. It should also boost recycling capacity to collect, sort and process 45% of the strategic materials in its waste for recycling.The demand for imports could be decreased with better material efficiency and recycling, said Mohammed Chahim, a Dutch MEP with the centre-left Socialists and Democrats and the group\u2019s lead negotiator for the proposal.

        "text": "A rare hooded seal pup born last week in the Netherlands has been moved to a more remote location to protect it from human contact.The pup was born on Vlieland, one of the West Frisian islands in the Wadden Sea off the north coast of the Netherlands. Hooded seals usually give birth on pack ice, and are rare visitors to these southern latitudes. In the past 10 years, there have been just four records of the species on the islands. Pups are weaned after just four days \u2013 the shortest period of any mammal.The seals are silver grey with charcoal faces and dark spots on their flanks, with fur pelts that have made them attractive to humans for coats and hats. Their pups are about one metre long at birth and have blue-grey backs that later develop into their leopard-like spots. Normally the seals follow the drifting pack ice off Arctic coasts such as east Greenland, from where this pair probably came. But now the warming seas are causing ice to melt, and their home territories are becoming unsustainable.The result is that unusual visitors such as these are appearing more frequently. The hooded seal mother and pup were discovered last Monday on land used by the Dutch military for training. The mother disappeared on Thursday, leaving the pup to fend itself. A rescue team from the Zeehondencentrum in Pieterburen, on the north-eastern coast of the Dutch mainland, has since moved the young animal to a more remote location.Like the walruses that have appeared off the Netherlands as well as UK and Irish shores recently, these visitors appear to be reluctant ambassadors of climate change. Hooded seals are used to ice floes and Arctic seas but sandy beaches and tidal flows disrupt normal behaviour \u2013 not least breeding and pup-bearing females, as this pup\u2019s predicament shows.Jeroen Hoekendijk, the researcher who photographed the young seal, said the animals were unaccustomed to these waters: \u201cThey are deep divers. The shallow and warm southern North Sea is no place for them,\u201d he said. Sandy shores present potential danger, too. \u201cWith high tide, a pup can flush away [whereas] the ice floats, and this is no issue.\u201dThe hooded seals of the north-east Atlantic are facing precipitous declines due to the climate crisis and their population is assessed as \u201cvulnerable\u201d. Historically, hooded seals were threatened by hunting. In 1881, a young Arthur Conan Doyle, not yet famous for his Sherlock Holmes stories, enlisted on a whaling and sealing expedition to the Arctic, where he took part in the hunting of hooded seals \u2013 then known as bladder seals after the males\u2019 extruded nostril membranes or \u201choods\u201d that give the species its name, and which inflate like a balloon in mating displays.Conan Doyle saw his first hooded seal perched on the crest of an ice floe: \u201cIt was speckled black and white and lay on the ice as the ship steamed past, looking at it quietly. Poor brute, if they are all as tame it seems a shame to kill them.\u201d But kill them they did. Conan Doyle recorded 1,216 seals killed in just one month of a seven-month hunt. Adults \u2013 most frequently females, as they refused to leave their pups \u2013 were shot. Bullets were not wasted on the young, which were clubbed.Hunting hooded seals was halted in the north-east Atlantic population in 2007 but the hunt continues in Greenland.",

They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down in the environment.The federal government estimates virtually all Americans have some level of the compounds in their blood, but the technology to measure PFAS in blood only exists for about 40 types of the chemical.The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recently for the first time implemented recommendations on when people who have been exposed to PFAS should be offered medical testing, but it only bases its guidelines off of eight common chemicals. The academy\u2019s report also gives advice for clinicians to reduce their patients\u2019 exposure to these chemicals.While that approach provides good broad, population level information, Liu said, it does not take into account the thousands of other chemicals that population subsets in the US may be exposed to for varying reasons, which are accounted for under the more sensitive methodology, called item response theory.It is unclear why Asian Americans have higher levels in their blood, Liu said, adding that more research is needed. However, fish is a major source of PFAS exposure and it\u2019s thought that populations with higher levels of seafood in their diets generally have higher levels of PFAS in their blood.Immigration history likely also plays a role, Liu said \u2013 different countries use different PFAS and have varying regulations. Failing to change the algorithm for how PFAS burden is measured in humans will leave clinicians and scientists \u201cless effective in helping vulnerable communities reduce their PFAS burden\u201d, Liu said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Your editorial (9 June) is correct to call Rachel Reeves\u2019 retreat from her \u00a328bn annual commitment on green investment an example of the renewal of a failed economic consensus. This has seen Labour aping Jeremy Hunt\u2019s ludicrous emphasis on reducing the national debt. Instead, Labour must become leader of a pack of opposition parties all demanding a massive increase in expenditure on social and green infrastructure, and on the wages and conditions of those working in these areas. One recent estimate suggests that to achieve this, the next government will need to invest \u00a3220bn per year.All opposition parties should promise the next parliament will use its powers to provide the money needed to fix broken Britain. This can come from three sources. First, the estimated \u00a355bn a year of tax breaks for pension savers must be redesigned to support employment-creating investment with social and environmental goals, as should some of the \u00a370bn a year saved tax-free in Isas \u2013 a much-needed exercise in intergenerational solidarity.Second, increased revenue from a fairer taxation system, where the wealthier contribute far more. Finally, as a backstop for any funding shortfalls, quantitative easing should be restarted. What Labour and indeed all the opposition parties have got to grasp is that you can\u2019t have the necessary equivalent of Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal without a massive increase in new debt. The \u00a328bn is a mere down payment.Colin HinesConvener, UK Green New Deal Group Rachel Reeves would have more fiscal headroom for increased green investment if she introduced an overseas tax liability for British citizens, avoiding vast amounts of tax, including on offshore-owned British assets. This could be similar to the US Internal Revenue Service requirements for Americans and resident aliens living abroad. They are expected to pay taxes according to the Internal Revenue Code, which includes tax credits for paying foreign taxes where you are living, deductions and exclusions.We cannot afford to repeat the 1997 Labour government\u2019s mistake of sticking to fictional Tory spending plans, rather than bringing our economy gradually towards sustainable German levels of taxation, and this time really invest in decent public services.David Nowell London Your report (9 June) on Labour\u2019s plan to delay the \u00a328bn-a-year spend on addressing the climate crisis until halfway through a first parliament makes no mention of the associated risks. These were cogently described by Rachel Reeves in 2021, when she told Labour\u2019s conference that if the government did not invest now then the costs of climate change would be greater. Under Labour, there would \u201cno dither, no delay\u201d in tackling the crisis.At the time, Labour referred to the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s 2021 fiscal risks report, which said \u201cdelaying decisive action to tackle carbon emissions by ten years could double the overall cost\u201d. For example, on costs associated with delayed investment until 2030 compared with immediate action, the report estimated that \u201cdebt in 2050-51 is 23 per cent of GDP higher than in the early action scenario\u201d.Labour may have decided that its political interests outweigh the risks of passing problems on to our children and grandchildren. But that is a political judgment. There should at least be transparency and honesty about the real risks associated with this choice.Mike Sheaff Plymouth Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

Once thought to be extinct, it was found again in 2018 and is facing an imminent threat from road widening.The first letter sent in April has been tabled at a Senate inquiry examining legislation for the government\u2019s proposed nature repair market, which has failed to secure support from the opposition or the Greens.The letter also alerted Plibersek to 27 other species, including the Mary River turtle \u2013 colloquially known as the punk turtle \u2013 that the committee would likely recommend be added to the critically endangered list.The committee sent a second letter in June stating an additional 14 species were likely to be declared critically endangered \u2013 making a total of 41 \u2013 as well as one ecological community.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nIn that letter, the committee\u2019s chair, Helene Marsh, said the \u201canticipated increase\u201d to the critically endangered lists \u201cdemonstrates the very serious and increasing extinction risks to Australia\u2019s biota\u201d.Marsh wrote that forthcoming changes to Australia\u2019s environmental laws and conservation planning, including a proposal for regional-scale approaches to development and environmental protection, would need to be designed in a way that could be adapted for and accommodate continuous new additions to Australia\u2019s lists of threatened wildlife.\u201cThe purpose was to remind [Plibersek] this is a fluid situation with a lot of species going up all the time,\u201d Marsh told Guardian Australia.\u201cIt\u2019s very important that any revision of the [Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation] Act accommodate that.\u201dSome, but not all, of the species likely to be listed as critically endangered were affected by the 2019-20 bushfires.Some, like the Mary River turtle, would be having their conservation status upgraded, but for the majority it would be the first time they are listed at any level under national laws.\u201cThis correspondence between the environment minister and the threatened species scientific committee makes one thing clear: nature in Australia is in big trouble,\u201d Peta Bulling, a nature campaigner with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said.\u201cPlants and animals that make this land unique are being pushed towards extinction at a truly alarming pace.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Between the 32 event locations analysed by the party, almost 1,000 sewage spills were found to have occurred this year.The former party leader Tim Farron said there needed to be a ban on sewage dumping in swimming areas.In Sale, Greater Manchester, swimmers attending a Boxing Day charity event will be exposed to waters that have had 94 sewage discharges nearby. On the same day, an event in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, will expose swimmers to waters in which there have been 67 sewage discharges lasting a total of 405 hours over the last year.A New Year\u2019s Day swim location in Saunderfoot, Wales, has had 1,244 hours worth of sewage pumped into nearby waters this year.Two years ago, outdoor swimmers in Oxfordshire were forced to cancel their Boxing Day swim after Thames Water announced a sewage dump on Christmas Day.Farron, now the Lib Dem\u2019s environment spokesperson, criticised the \u201cChristmas stink\u201d left by Conservative ministers. He expressed fears swimmers who could be made ill by the sewage, with no compensation from water companies after Conservatives blocked a proposed new law in parliament earlier this month.MPs rejected the amendment, tabled by Farron, to the victims and prisoners bill by 267 to 27, a majority of 240, with the Lib Dem MP calling the result an \u201cabsolute disgrace\u201d. He said Conservative MPs had \u201cyet again voted to let water companies off the hook.\u201cThis is a real Christmas stink for so many hoping to enjoy their traditional festive swim. The freezing cold water should be the only thing swimmers worry about, not sewage floating by them,\u201d Farron said.\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting that our coastlines and lakes have been polluted by this foul habit. There needs to be a ban on sewage discharges in swimming areas. When will Conservative ministers finally clamp down on profiteering water firms who are destroying our environment?\u201cIt was shocking to see Conservative MPs block plans to compensate swimmers made sick by sewage. Not only are they letting them pump sewage into waterways, but they are also content for swimmers to get sick.\u201dA report from the marine conservation charity Surfers Against Sewage found 1,924 cases of people getting sick because of suspected sewage pollution over the last year, nearly triple the number of cases reported in the previous year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In January, a judge ruled in his favour, ending the decades-long assumption that wild camping was allowed.\u2018Nothing can take its place\u2019: dismayed Dartmoor wild campers share memoriesRead moreHowever, lawyers for the park argue the judgment could be flawed because it hinges on a narrow definition of open-air recreation, where only activities such as walking, horse riding and picnicking are permitted. They also argue that it fails to take into account the historical understanding of the law, which thousands of people, including the park authority, understood to mean a right to camp and leave no trace.The court of appeals judge, Lady Justice Asplin, ruled that these reasons crossed the threshold for an appeal, and that it was conceivable that the previous judge presiding over the case misconstrued the meaning of open-air recreation, which could include wild camping.The Dartmoor Preservation Association is fundraising for the appeal. Tom Usher, CEO of the DPA, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a travesty that, at a time when the national park is operating under a 48% real-term budget cut over the last 12 years, that we should also be facing the loss of access rights at a time when the benefits of nature-connectedness have never been more vital.

More than 6,000 carcasses were picked up last year, which is believed to be the tip of the iceberg compared with how many birds would have died in total.Guillemots were worst affected, with more than 3,500 carcasses collected, followed by more than 800 kittiwakes. Rangers are particularly concerned about the small but vulnerable population of sandwich terns. There are an estimated 330 pairs nesting, and last year the bodies of about 300 adults and chicks were collected.\u201cWe suspect bird flu is going to hit us in a similar way to how it did last year,\u201d said Harriet Reid, lead ranger for the Farne Islands, which are a National Nature Reserve on account of their remarkable seabird colonies. \u201cMany of the species we care for are rare and struggling already due to climate change. Therefore, we want to try to mitigate the impact of this disease by limiting human access, and limiting disturbance,\u201d she said.National Trust rangers clear dead birds from Staple Island, one of the Farne Islands, during the bird flu outbreak in June 2022. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAThe National Trust islands are home to about 200,000 seabirds, including puffins, arctic terns, razorbills and shags. Most will come back to the islands in May and June. There have been some dead gulls and eider ducks on the island within the small overwintering population, although it has not been confirmed if they died of bird flu.For Inner Farne, the season typically runs from 1 April until the end of September, and for Staple Island it starts in May and finishes at the end of July. About 45,000 visitors land on the islands each year. Visitors will still be able to do tours around the islands and there is a chance they could open for visitors later in the season, the National Trust said.\u201cI can\u2019t see any other virus, issue or stormy weather that has ever hit the islands like this \u2013 the prospect of picking up 6,000 carcasses again is not great,\u201d said Reid. \u201cIt\u2019s never nice to think about bird flu and picking up dead birds. But I feel better about going into it this year because we know what it looks like, we know what is required to pick up bodies, and we\u2019ve had more time to plan.

Ben McCarthy, head of nature conservation and restoration ecology at the National Trust, said: \u201cThe recent impact of avian influenza on our wild birds is unprecedented. As threatened seabirds return to their breeding sites they become more susceptible to infection due to the high densities in these spectacular colonies.\u201cWe are actively participating in international research efforts to understand the long-term impacts of this pernicious disease and are doing everything we can to mitigate the impact on the Farne Islands and our other seabird sites.\u201dThe National Trust is not planning to close any other reserves as a result of avian influenza.

The report adds that \u201caccess to green space must be a priority in a land use framework, and provision and maintenance of accessible green space must also be strengthened in existing policies\u201d.The report suggests using the green belt to expand access to green space. Matthew Kirby, a PhD researcher at Northumbria University, told the report that \u2013 when viewed through a natural capital lens \u2013 green belt areas have the potential to deliver significant multifunctional land uses, including carbon sequestration, flood management and recreation.The Green MP Caroline Lucas recently tabled a private member\u2019s bill asking for the green belt to be open for the public, arguing it is near urban centres where many people do not have natural areas nearby.The report was also highly critical of the UK farming system. Jake Fiennes, the director of Holkham nature reserve in Norfolk, told the commission that \u201ccurrent agricultural and farming practices are generally unsustainable for the medium to long term. Our reliance on synthetic inputs and the effects they have on the wider environment are all too clear.\u201dThe report criticises the government for uncertainty around the post-Brexit farming payments, which were supposed to deliver nature recovery. Details around these have been delayed, with reports that the initially ambitious schemes are set to be weakened.Commenting on the report, Lord Cameron, the chair of the land use in England committee, said: \u201cLand use in England is facing a growing number of conflicting pressures and demands including for food, nature, biodiversity, net zero targets, housing, energy and wellbeing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "More than 80 million chickens died before reaching slaughter weight in the UK last year, with mortality rates the highest for at least a decade, reveal official figures.Animal welfare organisations say the fast-growing chicken breeds that dominate production have higher mortality rates, lameness and muscle disease than slower-growing breeds. They are calling on retailers to switch to slower-growing breeds and provide more space for the birds.An analysis of official figures in a new report by the animal welfare campaign group Open Cages found 82.3 million chickens died before reaching kill weight last year, a mortality rate of nearly 7%. It compares with 64 million chickens that died prematurely in 2021.More than 1.1 billion chickens are slaughtered for meat each year. The UK\u2019s Red Tractor farm assurance scheme requires mortality rates not to exceed 5%.The British Poultry Council said that avian flu and extreme summer temperatures had contributed to mortality rates last year. It said the industry worked hard to ensure welfare for all birds.Connor Jackson, head of Open Cages, said a move to slower-growing breeds could significantly reduce mortality rates. Fast-growing breeds, which campaigners call \u201cFrankenchickens\u201d, grow so quickly that their hearts and bone structure can struggle to cope.The British Poultry Council says there isn\u2019t consumer demand for a widespread adoption of slow-growing breeds, which would significantly increase the price of chicken meat in supermarketsHe said: \u201cThese figures highlight the shocking scale of suffering and death at the heart of the UK\u2019s chicken industry. Just like eggs from caged hens, Frankenchickens must go if we want to live up to our ambitions of leading animal welfare standards.\u201dThe RSPCA said the figures highlighted the poor welfare standards in modern chicken production. A spokesperson said: \u201cWhile the avian influenza outbreak will likely have impacted mortality rates in broilers, it is clear that such poor welfare standards and the use of fast-growing breeds will be contributing to the high mortality rate.\u201dAn initiative supported by animal welfare organisations, now called the Better Chicken Commitment, was launched in early 2017 to improve poultry welfare in broiler production. It stipulates more space for the birds and the use of slower-growing breeds.The government said last year that one of its priorities was to implement the commitment.Waitrose and Marks & Spencer have signed up to the initiative, but other major supermarkets have not. The animal welfare charity the Humane League UK challenged the government in a judicial review earlier this year over the use of fast-growing meat (broiler) chickens, which it argued are unlawful under animal welfare laws. Its challenge was rejected, but it has been granted leave to appeal.The British Poultry Council says the production of slow-growing breeds requires more food and space, with a greater environmental impact. It said there was not consumer demand for a widespread adoption of slow-growing breeds, which would significantly increase the price of chicken meat on supermarket shelves.It says consumers are offered chicken across different production systems, including organic and free range. And that the industry invests in research to improve efficiency and welfare, with data measuring health and welfare in the public domain so it can be scrutinised and challenged.Richard Griffiths, chief executive of the council, said: \u201cOur members consistently report mortality of below the 5% limit across all production types, so it is disingenuous to label one system or breed as better or worse.Lobby groups fought \u2018hard and dirty\u2019 against EU ban on caged farm animalsRead more\u201cWe take pride in our work to ensure good welfare for all our birds. We continue to drive improvements where we can, while reducing our environmental impact, increasing our productivity and providing affordable food for the nation.\u201dA Red Tractor spokesperson said: \u201cLast year was unprecedented for the UK and Europe\u2019s poultry industries, which saw extreme heat stress on flocks. Ongoing avian influenza measures required all flocks, regardless of breed, to be kept indoors.\u201cRed Tractor poultry standards require farms to monitor the health of their birds at least twice every day. Farms are expected to investigate, record and act on causes of mortality. Our farmers work with their vet to maintain and improve husbandry procedures.\u201dA spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs said: \u201cAs the highest-ranked G7 nation on World Animal Protection\u2019s Animal Protection Index, the UK is a world leader on animal welfare, and all farm animals, including meat chickens, are protected by extensive legislation to avoid unnecessary suffering. In 2022, we saw extreme heat events and outbreaks of avian influenza which affected the level of mortality seen on farms compared with previous years. Our Animal Health and Welfare Pathway is already providing incentives to farmers to adopt new technology to improve welfare and looking at supporting farmers to meet Better Chicken Commitment standards.\u201d",

        "text": "Facebook failed to enforce its own rules to curb an oil and gas industry misinformation campaign over the climate crisis during last year\u2019s presidential election, according to a new analysis released on Thursday.The report, by the London-based thinktank InfluenceMap, identified an increase in advertising on the social media site by ExxonMobil and other fossil-fuel companies aimed at shaping the political debate about policies to address global heating.InfluenceMap said its research shows the fossil-fuel industry has moved away from outright denying the climate crisis, and is now using social media to promote oil and gas as part of the solution. The report also exposed what it said was Facebook\u2019s role in facilitating the dissemination of false claims about global heating by failing to consistently apply its own policies to stop erroneous advertising.\u201cDespite Facebook\u2019s public support for climate action, it continues to allow its platform to be used to spread fossil-fuel propaganda,\u201d the report said. \u201cNot only is Facebook inadequately enforcing its existing advertising policies, it\u2019s clear that these policies are not keeping pace with the critical need for urgent climate action.\u201dThe report found that 25 oil and gas industry organisations spent at least $9.5m to place more than 25,000 ads on Facebook\u2019s US platforms last year, which were viewed more than 431m times. Exxon alone spent $5m.\u201cThe industry is using a range of messaging tactics that are far more nuanced than outright statements of climate denial. Some of the most significant tactics found included tying the use of oil and gas to maintaining a high quality of life, promoting fossil gas as green, and publicizing the voluntary actions taken by the industry on climate change,\u201d the report said.The report noted a rise in spending on Facebook ads in July 2020, immediately after then-presidential candidate Joe Biden announced a $2tn climate plan to promote the use of clean energy. The spending remained high until after the election four months later.\u201cThis suggests the oil and gas industry uses Facebook advertising strategically and for politically motivated purposes,\u201d the report said.InfluenceMap said it found 6,782 energy industry ads on Facebook last year promoting claims that natural gas is a green or low carbon fuel, even though research by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says otherwise.The research found that Exxon in particular used the social media site to push continued use of oil as affordable, reliable and important to keep the US from relying on other countries for its energy supply.InfluenceMap also accused the company of running misleading ads that sought to shift the greater responsibility for cutting carbon emissions from industry to the lifestyle choices of ordinary Americans. The report said that the International Energy Agency calculates that global targets to reduce emissions rely heavily on the energy industry moving to green technologies, while just 8% of reductions will come from consumer choices such as taking fewer flights.\u201cThese messages are often packaged in adverts promoting the climate-friendliness of oil and gas companies and the necessity of oil and gas for maintaining a high quality of life,\u201d the report said.InfluenceMap also drew attention to the part played by industry-funded groups led by the American Petroleum Institute, which spent $3m on Facebook ads last year portraying fossil-fuel companies as climate-friendly.InfluenceMap said that while Facebook removed some ads for making false claims or failing to include a disclaimer identifying them as about environmental politics, it permitted many others to go unchallenged.Facebook told the Guardian it has taken action against some groups running pro- fossil-fuel ads and that multiple advertisements have been rejected because they were run without being identified as political.\u201cWe reject ads when one of our independent factchecking partners rates them as false or misleading, and take action against pages, groups, accounts, and websites that repeatedly share content rated as false,\u201d said a Facebook spokesperson.Last year, a group of US senators wrote to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, about concerns that the social media platform was permitting demonstrably false claims about the climate crisis to be posted on the grounds they were \u2018opinion\u2019.\u201cGiven Facebook\u2019s long and troubling history with disinformation, it is deeply concerning that Facebook has now determined that climate disinformation is reportedly \u201cimmune to fact-checking\u201d, said the senators, including Elizabeth Warren.\u201cThe climate crisis is too important to allow blatant lies to spread on social media without consequence.\u201d",

        "text": "We are all affected by air pollution but some of us suffer a greater burden than others.An analysis published by the mayor of London has laid out the systematic air pollution differences between communities. Overall, people of black or mixed ethnicities are more likely to live in the most polluted places.There is ample evidence that air pollution exposure can lead to preterm and low birth-weight babies. Air pollution then hampers children\u2019s lung growth, increases the chance of childhood asthma and worsens asthma symptoms.Despite this, a new survey by the NGO Global Black Maternal Health has shown a lack of awareness of air pollution risks among expectant black mothers, and those with young children. It also found a need for increased knowledge among the health professionals who care for them.The survey findings were announced at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. It found many black mothers were aware of air pollution but less aware of risks that it posed. Some mothers would like to make lifestyle changes to reduce their air pollution exposure but felt they had few options.Agnes Agyepong, the founder of Global Black Maternal Health and Black Child Clean Air, said: \u201cIn the UK, black women are nearly four times more likely to die during pregnancy and experience twice the rate of stillbirth compared with white women. The report aimed to elevate the voices of black women, who are disproportionately exposed to illegal levels of air pollution but largely missing from conversations around clean air.\u201dThere are also important differences in air pollution between the richest and least well-off areas. These differences are not confined to London. Across England, the greatest air pollution is found in the poorest and also in the least white communities. During the first decade of this century, the gap between air pollution in the most and least deprived places got worse, not better.But looking at the quality of air that we breathe only shows us part of the problem. There is evidence that the least well-off are more vulnerable to air pollution. This includes studies from Italy and the UK.In 2019, a study on more than 300,000 people in the UK found that lung problems from air pollution were especially pronounced in people with lower income. This included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Prof Anna Hansell of the University of Leicester, who led the UK lung health study, said: \u201cWorryingly, we found that air pollution had much larger effects on people from lower-income households. Air pollution had approximately twice the impact on lung function decline and three times the increased COPD risk on lower-income participants compared to higher-income participants who had the same air pollution exposure.\u201dPossible reasons for greater susceptibility to harmful effects of air pollution include more childhood respiratory infections, poorer housing, worse indoor air quality, poor nutrition, and air pollution exposures at work for those with lower incomes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Tackling the multiplying effect from air pollution could be far faster. In London, the air pollution gap between the most and least deprived showed some decreases between 2013 and 2019, as did the differences between ethnic groups.",

But they say they have not received a reply to their offer.Ursus rotundus: contenders compete in Alaska\u2019s Fat Bear WeekRead moreA public petition asking for non-lethal measures for controlling the invasive primate population on the island \u2013 which is shared with French St Martin \u2013 has also amassed 3,742 signatures.However, the Nature Foundation Sint Maarten, which is carrying out the cull, has said that while the project is \u201cpainful and controversial\u201d, it remains a necessity.\u201cGiven the current significant but manageable size of the vervet monkey population, there is a window of opportunity to ensure that the issue does not worsen in coming decades,\u201d it said in a statement.Vervet monkeys were introduced to the region from Africa sometime around the 17th century and the first sightings on Sint Maarten date back to the early 1970s.Research carried out by the Nature Foundation St Maarten found in 2020 that about 450 were living on the Dutch side of the island. By 2022, that number had increased to about 2,000.\u201cGiven the current significant but manageable size of the vervet monkey population, there is a window of opportunity to ensure that the issue does not worsen in coming decades,\u201d it said.The monkeys have been blamed for eating crops, destroying gardens, entering schools and acting aggressively.Last December, the territory\u2019s ministry of tourism, economic affairs, transportation and telecommunication approved 100,000 Netherlands Antillean guilders (US$55,000) funding to control the species.The foundation said this was enough to pay for a single full-time ranger to carry out the cull along with equipment, but not for a sterilisation programme.Born Free USA says the information on which the cull is based is \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d.The group offered its \u201cexpertise, including voluntary veterinary services\u201d for alternative humane species management, and said it will also provide training to neighbouring territories.\u201cIn this way, Sint Maarten could lead the way on humane primate population management in the Caribbean region,\u201d the group wrote in a letter to the Sint Maarten government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This article was amended on 6 October 2023. An earlier version said that the government of Sint Maarten approved 100,000 Netherlands Antillean guilders (US$55,000) funding per year to control the species.

        "text": "The chasm between the climate action being taken and the emissions cuts required is set out bluntly in the new \u201cglobal stocktake\u201d report from the UN, produced in collaboration with nations.As it stands, nations will belch out about 22bn tonnes more carbon dioxide in 2030 than the climate can cope with if the global temperature rise is to be held to 1.5C and the worst impacts of the climate crisis are to be avoided. That 22bn tonnes that must be eliminated is equivalent to the combined emissions of the top five polluters today: China, US, India, Russia and Japan.Furthermore, the systemic transformation of every aspect of society that the report says is required needs to start kicking in quickly enough to halt the relentless rise of emissions seen since the Industrial Revolution within just two years.The global stocktake is the most comprehensive analysis of global climate action produced to date and is based on scientific and technical data, as well as consultations with governments, business and civil society. It is a key document that sets out what is required when leaders meet at the UN climate summit Cop28 in November.The report notes that the 2015 Paris agreement has driven action but says \u201cmuch more is needed now on all fronts\u201d. Crucially, it says it can be done. \u201cThere are now sufficient cost-effective opportunities to address the 2030 emissions gap,\u201d it says.The \u201cindispensable\u201d actions required are \u201cscaling up renewable energy and phasing out all unabated fossil fuels\u201d, as well as ending the destruction of forests and reducing methane emissions, especially from oil and gas operations.The report does not shy away from the scale of the challenge. \u201cIt is essential to unlock and redeploy trillions of dollars to meet global investment needs,\u201d it says. In other words, it requires reengineering the global financial system. Stopping the fossil fuel investments and vast subsidies that are throwing fuel on the climate fire is critical, it says.The report acknowledges that \u201crapid change can be disruptive\u201d but says ensuring climate policies are fair and protect the poor helps to extinguish opposition. Climate policies can also be poverty eradication policies, it says, such as replacing expensive gas power with cheap renewables.But it is going to be a long haul to re-establish the climate stability that enabled the rise of human civilisation over the last 10,000 years. \u201cEfforts to continue this progress must be sustained over decades,\u201d it says.The technology and finance to end the climate crisis exist: the greatest barrier is lack of political will. The report says: \u201cCreativity and innovation in policymaking and international cooperation is essential.\u201dIt says: \u201c[Countries] need to put in place durable, long-term reforms that integrate climate change risks into all aspects of planning, decision-making and implementation.\u201d This is currently extremely rare, with even the UK, which casts itself as a climate leader, recently backing new oil and gas licences and drawing up a climate adaptation plan derided as \u201cvery weak\u201d.Big businesses, without which global heating will not be stopped, are called out in the report for their frequent greenwashing. \u201cRigorous accounting [is] needed to lend credence to their contributions, track progress with environmental integrity and avoid double counting,\u201d it says. On stopping deforestation, it says shifting to sustainable healthy diets is essential, meaning sharp cuts in meat consumption in rich nations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

To survive as a grassroots movement you have to claim to have access to some higher form of truth that others don\u2019t. But as we Greens are transitioning to something with a broader political appeal, we are working to reduce that claim to truth and have the better arguments instead.\u201dHabeck\u2019s struggles mirror similar developments in the Netherlands, where anger at plans to cut nitrogen pollution led to a shock poll win for a new farmers\u2019 protest party, and Britain, where the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, last week announced a U-turn on some of the government\u2019s climate commitments.Habeck proved his ability and popularity in managing the 2022 energy crisis, but has recently struggled in his effort to overhaul Germany\u2019s fossil fuel-reliant heating sector.A proposed ban on the installation of conventional new gas or oil heating systems from 2024, drawn up by Habeck\u2019s ministry, came under fire this year and was only approved earlier this month after a protracted period of government infighting.In a wide-ranging interview, Habeck also defended the decision to pay the energy-intensive German industrial sector large subsidies to smooth its transition to green technologies.\u201cOur economy is changing,\u201d Habeck said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean we should willingly accept the loss of our old strengths, namely energy-intensive industries like steel or the chemical industry.\u201dIn July, the EU gave Germany the green light to pay steel giant Thyssenkrupp \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.7bn) of state subsidies for its proposed climate-neutral plant in Duisburg.\u201cIf we want economic security, we need those industries,\u201d said Habeck, a former Green party leader, who has governed in a three-party coalition with Olaf Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats and the liberal FDP since December 2021.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a European Respiratory Journal editorial, they said: \u201cWe need to do all we can to help alleviate patients\u2019 suffering.\u201dThey added that the impact of the climate emergency and human health had become interlinked and was now \u201cirreversible\u201d. An increase in pollen and other allergens as well as wildfires, dust storms and fossil fuel-based traffic all worsen existing respiratory conditions or can create new ones, the authors wrote in the peer-reviewed paper.Air pollution is estimated to have killed 6.7 million people globally in 2019 and 373,000 in Europe, with greenhouse gases and air pollution sharing many of the same sources.\u201cClimate change affects everyone\u2019s health, but arguably, respiratory patients are among the most vulnerable,\u201d said Zorana Jovanovic Andersen, a professor of environmental epidemiology at the University of Copenhagen and an author of the report. \u201cThese are people who already experience breathing difficulties and they are far more sensitive to our changing climate. Their symptoms will become worse, and for some this will be fatal.\u201dChildren are more affected by the climate crisis and air pollution because their lungs are still developing, they breathe faster and they inhale two to three times more air than adults while spending more time outdoors.Exposure to air pollution early in life could make it more likely that people develop chronic lung diseases later on, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bronchitis from smoking, the authors said.Cutting greenhouse gas emissions and stopping the planet from further heating would lead to \u201csubstantially larger and more immediate benefits\u201d, the authors wrote, as people\u2019s health would swiftly improve as air becomes cleaner.Jovanovic Andersen added: \u201cWe all need to breathe clean, safe air. That means we need action from policymakers to mitigate impacts of climate change on our planet and our health. As respiratory doctors and nurses, we need to be aware of these new risks and do all we can to help alleviate patients\u2019 suffering.\u201dRecent WHO reports have said that reducing emissions would result in better air quality, therefore regulating air pollution should be \u201cat the heart\u201d of any climate strategy, the authors wrote.On behalf of the European Respiratory Society, which represents more than 30,000 lung specialists from 160 countries, the authors want the EU to bring its air quality standards in line with the WHO.The EU\u2019s limits are 25 micrograms a cubic metre for fine particles (PM2.5) and 40 micrograms a cubic metre for nitrogen dioxide, compared with the WHO\u2019s five micrograms a cubic metre for PM2.5 and 10 micrograms a cubic metre for nitrogen dioxide.The UK government has set a target of 10 micrograms a cubic metre for PM2.5 by 2040, claiming it was impossible to match the WHO guidelines because of emissions blowing over the English Channel and from shipping.\u201cAs recent extreme weather events have shown, we need to prepare our community for a much more complex future adapting to the ever-increasing impact of climate-related respiratory disease,\u201d Jovanovic Andersen co-wrote in another recent review.",

Categorised by diet, carnivorous, insectivorous and grain-eating birds were found to have declined more rapidly than fruit- and nectar-eating types.Birds in specific habitats like grasslands and shrublands, classified in India as wastelands, had also declined more rapidly than those in open habitats.Migratory pintail ducks at Pobitora wildlife sanctuary in India\u2019s Assam district. The report classified the species as in rapid decline and of high conservation priority. Photograph: EPAThe exact causes of the falls in species populations are not yet clearly understood, but the report pointed to land-use changes, urbanisation, ecosystem degradation, monocultures, infrastructure development, pollution and climate breakdown as threats. The publishers of the report called for further research into the causes.It is the second edition of the SoIB report, after the first was published in 2020. The 2023 report highlights four priority species requiring conservation attention in each of India\u2019s 36 states and union territories.For species listed under moderate conservation priority, more work was required to identify early warning signals, while those in the low conservation priority were not to be ignored.\u201cWe need to work to keep common species common,\u201d said Suhel Quader, of the Nature Conservation Foundation, one of the groups involved.The report did find 217 species that were stable or increasing in numbers. Feral rock pigeons, Asian koel and Indian peafowl were found to be doing well, but the impact of their increasing numbers on other, more vulnerable species is not known.Common birds like the Baya weaver and pied bushchat were also found to be relatively stable.The publishers of the report placed great importance on public involvement, but they noted that more research and data gathering were needed for rare and nocturnal birds, which are not generally recorded by birdwatchers.

        "text": "Labour\u2019s new environment team says it will take on big businesses and supermarkets in order to halt pollution and stop farmers from being ripped off if it wins the next election.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has been criticised in the past for being too soft on polluting companies, and not using its full powers to stop water companies from spilling sewage. Farming groups have also criticised its close relationship with supermarkets, when farmers have felt ripped off by rising prices not being passed down the supply chain to their struggling businesses.The Labour Defra team is getting ready to release its strategy for governing if the party wins the election next year. Shadow ministers say they would take on big businesses by handing out criminal sanctions to chief executives who run polluting companies, and fixing the supply chain so farmers are paid a fair price for food sold in supermarkets.Labour sources said fighting for justice for neglected rural communities, who have had their local areas polluted, and been ripped off by big businesses such as supermarkets, was a key part of their election campaign. Winning rural and coastal seats is likely to prove crucial to the party\u2019s chances of commanding a majority.Steve Reed, the shadow environment secretary, told an event at the Labour party conference in Liverpool that he would get tough on the CEOs of companies that repeatedly contaminate the environment, making them personally criminally liable for pollution.Reed told an event hosted by the thinktank Onward: \u201cWhere you\u2019ve got such widespread law breaking, which is what\u2019s going on there, I think you have to take action of that kind and I see this as fundamentally very pro-business as well. It\u2019s very pro-business because good decent businesses, the vast majority of businesses, operate within the legal regulatory framework.\u201cThat\u2019s the level playing field that makes business and the economy work properly. If you get some businesses that can get away with breaking the law, or making additional profits that way, then you haven\u2019t got a level playing field. So it supports business by stopping businesses that are breaking the law from having that advantage.\u201dReed also promised to expand the powers of regulator Ofwat so that water bosses who fail to meet high environmental standards on sewage pollution will have their bonuses blocked. He said: \u201cWith Labour, the polluter \u2013 not the public \u2013 will pay. We will give Ofwat the powers to ban the payment of bonuses to water bosses until they have cleared up their filth.\u201dThe shadow nature and rural affairs minister, Toby Perkins, has promised to stop farmers from being ripped off by supermarkets.A report released last year by the charity Sustain found farmers were making less than a penny for every loaf of bread or block of cheese sold in supermarkets. With rising costs from inflation, farmers are struggling to make ends meet.Perkins told an event at the conference: \u201cI think we have to bring the supermarkets into this question as well, because clearly the pressure to drive down costs all the time within farming is significant, and the price that they are able to gain from supermarkets in the UK isn\u2019t always comparable with what farmers overseas will be able to get. I\u2019m aware that many farmers and food producers feel badly let down.\u201dThis issue has been raised by experts over the past two years, where food shortages due to the climate crisis, as well as spiralling costs, have highlighted problems with the supply chain.",

        "text": "Henry VIII was still on the throne when the shoots of a sweet chestnut first broke through the soil of Wrexham in what is now Acton Park. Copernicus was about to publish his theory that the Earth revolved around the sun. The Ming dynasty ruled China. More than 480 years on, the tree stands 24 metres tall and on Wednesday was crowned as tree of the year in the annual Woodland Trust competition. Generations have scavenged its chestnuts, taken the sticks that have fallen for firewood and sheltered beneath its splendid branches. It is not merely part of the landscape; it is part of community life.This year\u2019s contest highlighted urban trees, particularly vulnerable to felling and disease. There is now a host of evidence on the benefits that trees bring, not only in forests but in cities too. They range from boosting mental health, and even immunity, to reducing noise and air pollution, helping to cool the air, and reducing runoff in heavy rains \u2013 increasingly important as global temperatures rise. Beyond those lies the sheer pleasure that people take in them. The instinctive bond people feel was highlighted by the outrage and grief that greeted the overnight felling of the Sycamore Gap tree at Hadrian\u2019s Wall last month by unknown vandals. Though practically a sapling compared with Wrexham\u2019s tree \u2013 it was planted a mere 130 years ago \u2013 it had attracted marriage proposals and scatterings of ashes, as well as starring in countless photographs. Though the stump is expected to regrow, few of us will see anything approaching its former might in our lifetimes.This summer, Sheffield city council\u2019s new Labour leader acknowledged that some residents would \u201cnever forgive\u201d it for its draconian programme to fell thousands of street trees (many of them healthy), which saw elderly protesters being arrested in dawn raids. One of the nominees in this year\u2019s awards was an elm which narrowly escaped that culling.In Plymouth, the overnight felling of more than 100 trees helped to bring down the Tory council last year. Their Labour successors announced this week that they will plant almost double the number lost, from 16 species, in consultation with biodiversity specialists, with a new surface water drainage system in the surrounding play area irrigating the trees.Such attention to detail is welcome. Planting is not a quick fix for past mistakes. Saplings cannot replace mature trees. Quite apart from the sentimental attachment that people feel towards older specimens, they are often more resilient. Large numbers of trees in cities worldwide are dying; it will take the commitment of residents as well as councils to ensure they are properly maintained. And it takes decades for urban trees to offset the carbon emissions required to grow, plant and maintain them. The Woodland Trust is right to campaign for the legal protection of ancient trees.The landowner who planted the Sycamore Gap tree knew that he would never see its full glory. It was a gift to the future. Even as we add more trees, we must protect those left to us by past generations, for the sake of those to come.",

        "text": "I am an environmental social scientist and climate activist. As Jack Shenker describes in his article (The existential question for climate activists: have disruption tactics stopped working?, 6 March), Extinction Rebellion\u2019s recent decision to stop disrupting the public caused quite a fuss. Some people applauded the move as they thought it would favourably shift public opinion, while others insisted public disruption needs to remain a primary tactic to garner wider attention.Unfortunately, both camps are missing the point \u2013 once you have enough dedicated activists, the public is largely irrelevant to achieving political change. It is not the opinion, or even attention, of the public that matters, it is whether or not you are disrupting structures of power. Historical social movements have shown this repeatedly.Despite what we may like to believe in a democracy, public opinion is only one small influence on the government. It may theoretically give governments a mandate to act, but real change must first overcome powerful opposition from the structures that support governments, such as business and the legal and financial systems. The role of activists is to change the cost-benefit equation for these structures until it is more beneficial for them to accept change than to carry on with the status quo.For climate activists, the real question is not about the efficacy of disruptive tactics, it needs to be about targets. And the answer is power, not the public.Dr Laura Thomas-WaltersLlandaff, Cardiff What can we do about the climate crisis? What form should our protest take? Do the actions of Extinction Rebellion risk alienating those who they look to for support? Indigo Rumbelow, a supporter of Just Stop Oil and co-founder of Insulate Britain, takes the view that the debate \u201cis not between those who want to take \u2018moderate\u2019 or \u2018radical\u2019 action. It\u2019s between those who are standing by doing nothing at all, and those who are doing something. That\u2019s where the line is drawn.\u201dBut it should never be like this. A democracy should allow voters to choose how their country is governed. There should be a constitutional requirement for those of us seriously concerned about the climate crisis to have our views expressed in government. This obviously doesn\u2019t happen. Our government consists only of Tory MPs representing a minority of voters. Yes, we have offshore wind generation, but otherwise their response is desperately inadequate.As a result, we have to resort to any kind of protest we feel might make a difference. If our civilisation truly wants a route to survival, we need a representative democracy with proportional voting. Tim WilliamsonBath Jack Shenker asks if disruption tactics have stopped working in climate protests. I would ask: did they ever work? Starting with the suffragists and suffragettes (or possibly earlier), most radical and progressive movements have had extreme wings, driven by a sense of frustration that their voice is not being listened to.I would love to see some academic work try to quantify the effect of publicity-seeking \u201cstunts\u201d against patient political foot-slogging. Having spent most of my life doing the latter, I feel politics does work. I was born into a world where homosexuality and abortion were illegal and mixed\u2011race marriage regarded as immoral. That has changed. Conventional politicians such as Roy Jenkins and David Steel did their stuff \u2013 and succeeded.Paul ChandlerBrighton  Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

        "text": "Over the Christmas period, the upper North Island of New Zealand experienced stormy conditions, grounding flights and flooding roads. Thunderstorms broke out on 22 December, leading to heavy rainfall and an incredible 4,500 lightning strikes in just two hours. Unfortunately, one of these lightning strikes set a property alight in the town of Wait\u014dtara in the south of the island. Although no injuries were reported, the property and surrounding farmlands were mostly destroyed. Furthermore, a small tornado was spotted in the Southland region of the South Island, though thankfully, no damage was caused.Although there were long sunny spells on Christmas Day, thunderstorms arose once more on Boxing Day. Between 2pm and 7pm local time, about 25-40mm fell over the upper North Island, although one rain gauge in the Auckland suburb of \u014ct\u0101huhu recorded 50mm in just one hour. Parts of the motorway close to Mount Wellington were consequently closed, and several flights grounded. This excessive rainfall comes after several months of above average precipitation for the area, which exacerbated the risk of ground flooding and landslides.In contrast to New Zealand, it was on Christmas Day that Mexico City experienced treacherous weather. The air quality is usually poor on 25 December due to the fireworks and festivities of the previous night. This year, however, residents also faced thunderstorms. Heavy rain and localised flooding swept across the city, alongside reports of lightning and hail. The authorities urged residents to take extra caution as power lines could be damaged and driving conditions more difficult. Some more mountainous regions, however, had a white Christmas, seeing some snowfall as an extension of the recent North American cold snap.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But last week saw heat of an altogether different order.Temperatures were of such magnitude that they called for measures never before seen in a country that prides itself on being the first in Europe to have appointed an official dedicated solely to dealing with the challenges of global heating.And so it was that at noon on Friday the Acropolis was closed in the name of \u201cprotecting\u201d visitors from the sun. There would be other steps, both unprecedented and bold. Volunteers with the Hellenic Red Cross had been seconded to distribute free bottles of water, first-aid rescue workers had been dispatched to the site, and shading had been erected at the main entrance to the Golden Age temples. It was hoped the media could inform foreigners because it was a \u201cvery difficult\u201d day.In what would be the hottest day of the year \u2013 with the mercury hitting 45C (113F) in Syntagma Square and likely reaching 48C (118F) on the rocky outcrop on which the Acropolis stands \u2013 \u201cdifficult\u201d soon resembled a war footing at the base of Greece\u2019s most visited monument.By noon, 30,000 water bottles had been handed out \u2013 the fruit of donations to the Red Cross; men, women and children who had either collapsed or fainted had received first aid in field tents; and some 11,000 visitors had filed through the fifth-century BC wonder, frequently escorted by guides entreating them to \u201cmove faster\u201d to escape temperatures seen as the invisible enemy.By 8pm, when the gates to the site were closed, almost twice that number had made the gruelling ascent. Among them on Friday was Annali Kemp with her two teenage children and husband, Steve, who baulked when she saw the queues and came close to leaving before being \u201cspurred on\u201d by her family to stay.\u201cTo think it\u2019s only mid-July and we\u2019ve got August to come,\u201d said the 53-year-old Briton, visibly red-faced after the exertions of the climb. \u201cWe were squished like sardines at some point up there but it\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\u201cWe now live in New Zealand where there are no antiquities, so you put up with the heat, and God was it hot, so hot that for the first time \u2013 and please feel free to write this \u2013 I didn\u2019t have any hot flushes.\u201dPeople try to cool off at a fountain in Syntagma Square in Athens as temperatures soar to 45C.

The Hellenic National Meteorological Service said that from today the intensity of the heat is expected to decrease, but from Thursday temperatures will start to rise again and a new heatwave will be felt in most parts of the country.Up at the Acropolis, the realities of the climate emergency were on full display as it becomes ever more evident that the future will be fraught with difficulty as humans and urban environments attempt to adapt to temperatures accelerating with a speed few had envisaged.By 9pm on Friday, the Greek culture ministry announced that the ancient sanctuary would be closed on Saturday \u2013 only this time earlier than on Friday \u201cbecause the stones and marbles have now absorbed so much heat\u201d.\u2018I\u2019ve never seen heat this bad.

A plane with a p\u016bteketeke campaign banner also flew over the beaches of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.Oliver then appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon dressed in a p\u016bteketeke costume to promote the bird.The p\u016bteketeke is known for carrying its young on its back, sharing chick-rearing responsibilities, and eating its own feathers to induce vomiting as a method to expel parasites. It has a chorus of grunts, growls and barks and engages in an elaborate set of mating dances, including the \u201cweed dance\u201d where the birds offer each other water weed and the \u201cghostly penguin\u201d where they rise chest to chest.The competition, run by environmental organisation Forest & Bird, normally attracts just under 60,000 votes but this year those figures leapt to 350,000 across 195 countries, with 290,374 of those going to the p\u016bteketeke. Thousands of fraudulent votes had to be weeded out, including 40,000 votes cast by a single person for the tawaki piki toka eastern rockhopper penguin.New Zealand\u2019s national bird, the North Island brown kiwi, came second on 12,904 votes, while the world\u2019s only alpine parrot, the clever kea, came third with 12,060 votes.Anyone complaining about the p\u016bteketeke (Australasian Crested Grebe) being crowned @Forest_and_Bird NZ Bird of the Century the year must not be aware how it is serving looks from the day it is hatched! \ud83d\udc23\ud83d\udc51 pic.twitter.com/5JPwV5FExr\u2014 Sarah B.

You wield incredible power. It\u2019s long overdue you meet your responsibilities and bear down on the attempts to distort truth.\u201dThe mayor said there was evidence that \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on the anti-Ulez online manipulation campaign on Twitter alone\u201d but \u201cwe have no idea who was behind the campaign\u201d.Research conducted by the social media analysts Valent in July concluded there was evidence of \u201can extensive online campaign targeted to undermine support for the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez)\u201d before the Uxbridge byelection.It found that 48% of the accounts on Twitter, now known as X, mentioning Ulez were created after November 2022, and of those about 90% \u201cexhibited signs of inauthenticity\u201d, using generic names and with a high proportion of fake followers.These accounts \u2013 called spreaders \u2013 were primarily engaged in retweeting anti-Ulez opinions from real people or groups opposed to expansion of the area covered by the \u00a312.50 daily charge for old, polluting vehicles across all of London in August.The aim, the researchers concluded, was to have \u201cthousands of accounts promoting anti-Ulez content on to users\u2019 timelines\u201d. Valent said it only looked at anti-Ulez accounts on Twitter, not other social media sites, but it believed the campaign cost at least \u00a3168,000.Labour failed to take Boris Johnson\u2019s old seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in July by 495 votes, despite big swings against the Conservatives in two other English seats the same day. The party\u2019s unexpected defeat was blamed on the unpopularity of the Ulez expansion to outer London, prompting recriminations within Labour.Khan accepts there are \u201cgenuine concerns about the impact of Ulez expansion\u201d, but he believes it is possible that those concerns may have been amplified by social media manipulation, and that the technique could be applied in future.\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that the anti-Ulez misinformation assault was a precursor for a much larger attack on future climate and environmental policies,\u201d the mayor is expected to add, when he speaks at the Strong Cities Network at Columbia University in New York.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The presence of so-called \u201cwatermelon snow\u201d \u2013 an unofficial moniker due to its pinkish tint \u2013 is piquing the curiosities of photo-seeking visitors and raising a host of questions about nature, health and climate. Its prevalence this summer is particularly striking on ridges and in mountain ranges where snow would have melted by now in drier years.The Technicolor snow appears in high-altitude environments throughout the globe including the French Alps and Japan\u2019s Mountains of Dewa when a perfect storm of conditions \u2013 water content, sunlight, temperatures and the presence of nutrients \u2013 awaken dormant green algae called Chlamydomonas nivalis that thrive in cold temperatures. The algae swim to the surface of the snow, where they bloom and divide. Upon arrival, when they are hit by sun and ultraviolet rays, their color changes to absorb radiation and protect themselves from damage.Scott Hotaling, a Utah State University ecologist who studies biodiversity in cold and high-altitude environments, likened the algae\u2019s ability to produce a secondary pigment to humans, whose skin uses pigmentation to absorb ultraviolet radiation and protect from the sun.\u201cThey need some kind of pigmentation to prevent damage related to the high-UV of the environment they\u2019re in. So they produce the secondary pigment largely for that purpose to protect themselves,\u201d he said.Many wonder if they can eat the pink snow. The answer: technically yes, because it is not harmful to ingest, Hotaling said. However, it is not recommended since it is often found in melting snow banks also dotted with dirt and dust that contain toxins.\u2018Watermelon\u2019 snow seen in the Dolomites of Italy. Photograph: Bob Gibbons/AlamyHotaling said the algae pose little risk to human health or to animals like cattle, dogs or fish, should they encounter them as they melt into water. But even though it is not a risk to clean water supply, the \u201cwatermelon snow\u201d phenomenon does cause snow to melt more quickly, raising environmental concerns about seasonal snowmelt patterns and the longevity of the glaciers where the algae are known to thrive.Blood glaciers: why is Alpine snow turning pink?Read moreThough snow becoming water makes it available to nourish the algae, the exposure of bare ground changes how much light is reflected versus absorbed. Darker colors absorb more sunlight, turning snow banks and glaciers into liquid more quickly.The changes in the magnitude and timing of the melting \u2013 the exposure of bare ground earlier in the season \u2013 can cause problems in the mountain west, affecting ecosystems and species that rely on cool water downstream and reservoirs designed to accommodate more gradual snowmelt. In places like the Arctic, glacier melt can cause sea level rise, threatening flooding on coastlines and in lakes.\u201cWhen we add light-absorbing particles that essentially darken the snow \u2013 like snow algae, black carbon or dust \u2013 it reduces its ability to reflect solar radiation,\u201d said Alia Khan, a biogeochemist that studies glaciers at Western Washington University.",

It is a dangerous toxic chemical and proposing to ban it will protect families, workers and communities,\u201d said the EPA deputy administrator, Janet McCabe.TCE, or trichloroethylene, is a volatile organic compound that humans are frequently exposed to in a variety of settings, though those who use products with the chemical in an occupational setting are most at risk. It\u2019s also commonly used in carpet cleaning treatments, hoof polishes, brake cleaners, pepper spray and lubricants.Among other health issues, the chemical is thought to be a carcinogen and a liver toxin, harm male reproduction, cause neurological damage, damage kidneys and cause Parkinson\u2019s disease.Officials suspect TCE water contamination is behind multiple cancer clusters, and the compound is one a range of chemicals polluting military base drinking water that is suspected of sickening and killing service members at bases across the US. Areas in the US with the highest TCE contamination levels have been designated Superfund sites, which is reserved for the nation\u2019s most polluted locations.Recent EPA research found that as much as 250m pounds of TCE are still produced in the US annually, and much of that ends up in the water.Efforts to ban the chemical date back 40 years. The Obama administration proposed strong limits on its use in 2016, but the Trump administration undid those and in effect suspended the process. The Biden administration is going even further than the Obama EPA by proposing an outright ban, a step the agency rarely takes when regulating toxic chemicals.Public health advocates have pressed for prohibition since the 2016 passage of legislation that expanded the EPA\u2019s authority over toxic chemicals and made it easier to outlaw them. Advocates applauded the Biden administration for taking the step.\u201cThis rule will save countless lives and billions of dollars related to healthcare costs, missed work and environmental cleanup,\u201d said Avonna Starck, Minnesota state director of Clean Water Action.The EPA follows the lead of New York and Minnesota, which have already banned the chemical, and advocates say the action highlights how state action can pressure the federal government to act on chemical regulation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Sadiq Khan has won the backing of the mayor of Milan, one of Europe\u2019s most congested cities, for an extension of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) in London after criticism from voters and his own party leader over the charges facing motorists.Giuseppe Sala, who has led Milan\u2019s municipal government since 2016, said the mayor of London\u2019s policy on polluting cars was an inspiration to his own attempts to improve air quality in his city in northern Italy.Sala said Khan should be backed in his efforts by national-level politicians given the tens of thousands of avoidable deaths from pollution, as the mayor comes under growing pressure to revise his plans to extend the Ulez charge beyond inner London next month.\u201cThe introduction of London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone and its planned expansion continues to inform Milan\u2019s strategy to prioritise space for people over cars, reduce the number of polluting vehicles on our streets and protect residents\u2019 health,\u201d Sala said. \u201cWe have been looking at the transformational impact of the Ulez on reducing the concentration of NO2 and PM2.5 in central and inner London, which has led to about 4 million Londoners breathing cleaner air. London\u2019s example shows what can be done when you combine a clear political will with strong engagement from partners and local communities.\u201dAs Labour loses Uxbridge over Ulez, what now for the party\u2019s green policies?Read moreThe Ulez policy, which imposes a \u00a312.50 daily charge on drivers of older diesel and petrol vehicles, was a critical issue in last week\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip byelection in north-west London, which Labour narrowly lost.Rishi Sunak has suggested that such wedge issues could be the answer to his party\u2019s electoral problems, while Keir Starmer has indicated Khan should rethink his plans to extend the zone in August beyond inner London to take in all the capital\u2019s boroughs.\u201cWe are doing something very wrong if policies put forward by the Labour party end up on each and every Tory leaflet,\u201d Starmer said on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to face up to that and learn the lessons.\u201dCity Hall has suggested Khan is in \u201clistening mode\u201d.Sala said that instead of being a focus of criticism, Khan\u2019s policy should be backed by all those regional and national leaders across Europe who are concerned about the impact of poor air quality in major cities.In 2021, the World Health Organization said limiting air pollution levels could prevent 50,000 deaths annually across the continent.Sala, who was part of the centre-left Democratic party administration that banned the most-polluting vehicles from \u201carea B\u201d covering 72% of Milan in 2019, but in 2021 joined the European Green party, said: \u201cWe can learn from each other\u2019s experiences and hopefully lead the way for other cities to take bold actions.\u201cRegional and national governments should also support what frontrunner cities are doing: this is a matter of public health and should be a priority for all levels of government.\u201dUlez was introduced in central London in 2017 and by October 2022 it had reduced nitrogen dioxide from traffic by 46%. Studies suggest about 4,000 Londoners die prematurely every year due to toxic air.Milan has some of the worst air pollution in Europe, with 49 cars owned among every 100 inhabitants.Its mayor added that, while he recognised that the low-emission zones could disproportionately affect those on the lowest wages, the answer was investment in public transport and shared car clubs.Sala said: \u201cI am conscious that those residents who drive an older polluting car may find it difficult to upgrade to a cleaner vehicle. This is why in addition to area B, we must give city residents alternative ways to move around the city, through increasing and improving public transport, shared vehicles and more safe bike lanes.\u201cThe introduction of area B in Milan was accompanied by a long-term investment in extending and improving public transportation \u2013 we are completing our new metro line, M4 \u2013 and to achieve fully electric public transport by 2030. We are also listening to the concerns of residents, providing support for those who need it most to access transportation, subsidies and exemptions.\u201cMilan has some of the poorest air quality in Europe, but area B will have a significant impact, cutting both PM10 and NOx pollution in half by 2022 and 2026, respectively.\u201dSala said that since London introduced the congestion charge in 2012, the city\u2019s administration had been the pioneer from which to learn.He said: \u201cWe are looking closely at London\u2019s model for a progressive expansion of the low-emission zone, investment in an inclusive scrappage scheme and expansion of public transport and active mobility options. By working together and sharing our experiences we can make a difference.\u201d",

By comparison, humanity now weighs in at a total of around 390m tonnes.At the same time, the species we have domesticated, such as sheep and cattle, in addition to other hangers-on such as urban rodents, add a further 630m tonnes to the total mass of creatures that are now competing with wild mammals for Earth\u2019s resources. The biomass of pigs alone is nearly double that of all wild land mammals.The figures demonstrate starkly that humanity\u2019s transformation of the planet\u2019s wildernesses and natural habitats into a vast global plantation is now well under way \u2013 with devastating consequences for its wild creatures. As the study authors emphasise, the idea that Earth is a planet that still possesses great plains and jungles that are teeming with wild animals is now seriously out of kilter with reality. The natural world and its wild animals are vanishing as humanity\u2019s population of almost eight billion individuals continues to grow.Fin whales feeding off the Gulf of California. The species was found by the study to have the highest biomass of ocean creatures. Photograph: Nature Picture Library/Alamy\u201cWhen you look at wildlife documentaries on television \u2013 for instance of wildebeest migrating \u2013 it is easy to conclude that wild mammals are doing quite well,\u201d lead author Ron Milo told the Observer.\u201cBut that intuition is wrong. These creatures are not doing well at all. Their total mass is around 22m tonnes which is less than 10% of humanity\u2019s combined weight and amounts to only about 6lb of wild land mammal per person. And when you add all our cattle, sheep and other livestock, that adds another 630m tonnes. That is 30 times the total for wild animals. It is staggering. This is a wake-up call to humanity.\u201dThe study, The Global Biomass of Wild Mammals, also reveals that those that do best \u2013 such as the white-tailed deer in the US and wild boars \u2013 are those that find it easier to adapt to the presence of humans. Both species can be found near settlements and are occasionally treated as pets. \u201cEven within the wild, the fingerprints of humanity are obvious,\u201d added Milo, whose team\u2019s study is published in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.As part of the paper, researchers Lior Greenspoon and Eyal Krieger collected biomass data on about half of all known mammals and used machine-learning computational models on other zoological samples to calculate the other half.The grim figures for land mammals were matched by those found in the oceans. The total mass of marine mammals was calculated to be around 40m tonnes. Fin whales have the largest total biomass with sperm whales and humpbacks coming into the second and third slots, respectively.Domesticated-to-wild mass ratios emphasise the active role humans play in shaping the abundance of mammals on EarthStudyCommon pet species were also found to be major contributors to humanity\u2019s planetary impact. Domestic dogs have a total mass of around 20m tonnes, a figure close to the combined biomass of all wild terrestrial mammals, while cats have a total biomass of around 2m tonnes, almost double that of the African savanna elephant. \u201cThese domesticated-to-wild mass ratios emphasise the active role humans play in shaping the abundance of mammals on Earth,\u201d the researchers state in their paper.Biomass studies are not the only way to quantify the animal world. Numbers of species are also revealing. As an example, it has been found there are 1,200 species of bats that account for a fifth of all land mammal species and two-thirds of all individual wild mammals by head count. However, they make up only 10% of the biomass of wild land mammals.\u201cBiomass is complementary to species richness and other diversity metrics, and can serve as an indicator of wild mammals\u2019 abundance and ecological footprint on a global scale,\u201d the researchers state.Estimates made two years ago by the team suggested there were about 50m tonnes of wild mammals on Earth. The new figure, calculated using a host of techniques including AI, indicates that the crisis facing the planet\u2019s wildlife appears to be much worse than first appreciated. Just how quickly the depletion of wild mammals is proceeding now needs to be assessed as a matter of urgency, they say, and is the focus of the study\u2019s next phase which will assess how much of the biomass loss occurred over the past 100 years.",

The campaigners argue that the planning committee that granted permission for the drilling erred because it only accounted for emissions arising from the drilling site itself, rather than those from the oils\u2019 end use, when it is burned and most of the emissions produced.She has already lost in the high court and the court of appeal. On Wednesday morning, five supreme court justices, Lord Kitchin, Lord Sales, Lord Leggatt, Lady Rose, and Lord Richards, began hearing the case.Shell drops target to cut oil production as CEO aims for higher profitsRead moreA victory would have serious implications for future plans for oil and gas wells and coalmines in the UK, forcing planners to take into account the total emissions from any fossil fuels extracted, rather than merely the emissions from the extraction.Ahead of the case, Finch said: \u201cThe biggest climate impact from fossil fuel projects occurs when the fuel they produce is eventually burned.\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that these \u2018downstream\u2019 GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions are ignored when planning decisions are made. I hope that the supreme court will give a clear ruling and end the dangerous lack of clarity on this point.\u201dThe proposed expansion of the Horse Hill site would include five drilling cellars, four hydrocarbon production wells, four gas-to-power generators, a process, storage and tanker loading area, seven 1,300-barrel oil tanks, and a 37-metre drill rig. Altogether, they would allow for the large-scale production of up to 3.3m tonnes of crude oil, for sale and use as transport fuel for the next 20 years.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to overstate the importance of this case,\u201d said Rowan Smith, a solicitor with Leigh Day, who is representing Finch.\u201cThe supreme court will rule conclusively on whether or not the climate change impact of fossil fuel development in the UK must be taken into account before planning permissions are granted.

        "text": "George Orwell\u2019s \u201cfour legs good, two legs better\u201d has long been the case when it comes to access to England\u2019s forests, the British Horse Society contends. But \u201cequality\u201d may now be in sight. For decades, those wishing to ride horses on some of the country\u2019s most beautiful off-road routes have had to seek a permit, a bit of paperwork that neither pedestrians nor cyclists need.Forestry England, which oversees that system, maintains that such paid-for permits are important in sensitive sites to avoid damage to the environment or clashes between horse riders and those enjoying a ramble or bike ride through the countryside.The word in equestrian circles in recent days, however, is that despite some suspected reverse snobbery over the perceived high-born status of riders, the \u201cdiscrimination\u201d of the past may now be coming to an end.A new consultation on the system of permits launched by the forestry agency in recent days and ending on 9 April has given some hope of a more equitable future to Mark Weston, director for access at the British Horse Society (BHS), and the 3 million riders he represents at the charity.\u201cHorse riders should have free access as walkers and cyclists have free access,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is discrimination.\u201d\u201cIn a lot of forests there aren\u2019t permits at all, which just demonstrates to us that they are not really needed,\u201d he added. \u201cForestry England\u2019s justification is that the cost of the permits is reinvested into the routes but our view is that it doesn\u2019t really happen and if it does happen, well, walkers and cyclists are benefiting from that investment at the cost of equestrians.\u201dThe BHS argues that there is a strong safety argument for better access: in 2022 alone, 68 horses were killed on Britain\u2019s roads and 139 people were injured.Nevertheless, the way forward could be heavy going.There have been well-publicised clashes between cyclists and horse riders, most recently in the New Forest national park in Hampshire where a horse riding group called out a growing number of \u201crude and abusive cyclists\u201d. It was noted that the growth of electric cycles meant users could cover large distances at a dangerously high speed.A leading cycling charity plays down concerns about about overcrowding. Photograph: Keith Morris/AlamyBut Weston said reports of such tensions were overblown.\u201cSometimes it is said there will be conflict between horse riders, walkers and cyclists but everyone is allowed by law to use bridleways and the evidence is that such conflict does not exist,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a very, very small proportion \u2013 those stories make the news but it is normally on the road than elsewhere.\u201dTo the argument that horses inflict greater damage to the bridleways, Weston responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think that is necessarily the case as the number we are talking about is so much lower in volume [compared with walkers and cyclists].\u201cAlso, what we are saying is that on a lot of routes in the forest you have 20-tonne logging machinery using those, so horse riders aren\u2019t going to do any damage at all to surfaces. We have been lobbying for a number of years at the inequality and the inequitable existence of the permits.\u201dA leading cyclist charity has boosted morale at the BHS by also playing down concerns about overcrowding.\u201cCycling UK believes these tracks should be open to cyclists and horse riders as a public right, rather than requiring permits,\u201d said Sophie Gordon, Cycling UK\u2019s off-road campaigns manager. \u201cThis has been the case for public forests in Wales and Scotland for almost 20 years without problems, and it would have great benefits in England for getting more people to be active outdoors.\u201dWeston said he expected there to be minimal resistance to the BHS\u2019s case for jettisoning the permit system despite the sense among some in the equestrian community that they are seen as wealthy enough to pay their way.\u201cThese days that is not the case and that is an old stereotype,\u201d Weston said. \u201cYou only have to appreciate people out hacking locally on ponies aren\u2019t from the wealthy sector of society. Old images are very hard to dissipate.\u201dStuart Burgess, a spokesperson for Forestry England, said the consultation on how the permit system was working had received hundreds of submissions in just the few first days and that it would take six to eight weeks to assess the data.He insisted that permits remained an important part of the management of England\u2019s forests although there was no one clear expected outcome from the process. \u201cWe definitely need them in some particular places,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about whether they are working as well as can be.\u201d",

Negotiations were set to continue on Monday, but plans were being drawn up for a minister to submit a statement to the Commons this week committing to change the existing planning rules.Once the rebels in question have secured the necessary guarantees, they would drop their amendment.Since 2015, an objection from a single resident can prevent a windfarm from being built. Councils can approve new sites only if they can show that local concerns have been \u201cfully addressed\u201d.According to government sources, the changes would allow councils to \u201cmore flexibly address the planning impacts of onshore wind projects as identified by local communities\u201d and allow farms to be built \u201cwhen it has been demonstrated that the planning impacts have been satisfactorily addressed\u201d.The new guidance will stress that developers must \u201cact on concerns and suggestions\u201d from residents and that councils can only approve them where \u201cthere is community support\u201d.Under the changes, local authorities will also be given more discretion to choose the location of new onshore wind projects.One Tory MP supporting the amendment said No 10 had little choice but to act, given that it was supported by \u201csenior people from all wings of the party\u201d.The announcement will mark the second time that Sunak has been forced to act on the issue after coming under pressure from MPs in his own cabinet. When he took office last year, he pledged to keep the ban in place, before a rebellion by backbenchers two months later prompted him to U-turn.Facing backlash once more from Tory MPs who oppose the construction of new windfarms, the prime minister promised that rules would be drawn up to ensure local communities are fully consulted before any new project can be built.In December, Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, said Sunak was \u201cin office but not in power\u201d and that he and Michael Gove were \u201cbeing forced into this position because they\u2019re too weak to stand up to another backbench rebellion\u201d.She added: \u201cWe will need to see the detail, but if it is a fudge that leaves in place a very restrictive system for onshore wind \u2013 the cheapest, cleanest form of power \u2013 it would continue to deny Britain lower energy bills and improved energy security during an energy crisis.\u201d",

Unlike the well known British insect, North American snow flies habitually walk across snow and ice in the wild and have been observed doing so at temperatures as low as -10C.The researchers used dozens of snow flies from four different but closely related species collected from icy, mountainous habitats in Washington state, Colorado and Vermont in the US, and British Columbia and Yukon in Canada.In their experiments, the team placed individual flies on laboratory cold plates and observed their behaviour with a thermal imaging camera as the temperature slowly dropped.The flies could still walk even when their bodies reached -7C, and the thermal imaging camera was able to capture the precise moment at which the flies\u2019 legs began to freeze, prompting the amputation response. This happened in 31% of cases where freezing began in a leg. Some flies removed as many as five legs before succumbing to the cold.The team has published a paper online detailing their findings, though it is yet to be peer-reviewed.Other crane flies are known to self-amputate their legs \u2013 but for different reasons. They tend to do it when a predator grabs on to one of their limbs. According to Tuthill, there are muscles inside the flies\u2019 legs that seemingly allow them to pinch off or detach a limb at will.Certain geckos, crayfish and squid can also self-amputate their limbs or tails to escape predators. The African spiny mouse can even shed huge quantities of its own skin in a tight spot.However, leg self-amputation as a response to potentially freezing to death was described as \u201cunique\u201d by the researchers.March of the fire ants could reach Sydney\u2019s outskirts by 2035, costing economy up to $1.2bn a year Read more\u201cIt\u2019s an extreme adaptation,\u201d said Erica McAlister, the curator of flies and fleas at the Natural History Museum, while praising the research.In their paper, Tuthill and colleagues speculated that the flies may be able to detect a slight rise in temperature inside their legs, which is \u2013 somewhat counterintuitively \u2013 caused by a release of energy when ice crystals form. Researchers plan to investigate this hypothesis in future experiments, Tuthill said.McAlister noted that the hardy flies have an evolutionary advantage in being able to survive, much of the time, in spite of the snow and ice. But that may evaporate as mountainous areas lose their snow cover due to global heating.\u201cWhen the snow disappears and this selective advantage of them being able to peg it out of the situation goes, you\u2019re going to have a deleterious effect,\u201d she said.",

The new El Ni\u00f1o comes on top of the increasing global heating driven by human-caused carbon emissions, an effect the WMO called a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d. This can supercharge extreme weather, and temperature records are already being broken on land and at sea across the globe.The WMO said there was now a 90% probability of the El Ni\u00f1o event continuing to the end of 2023 at a moderate strength or higher. The chance of a strong and even hotter El Ni\u00f1o at the year\u2019s end was put at 56% by US authorities in an estimate in early June.Natural variations in winds and ocean temperatures in the Pacific drive the irregular switches between El Ni\u00f1o and its cooler opposite La Ni\u00f1a. It is the planet\u2019s biggest natural climate phenomenon and affects billions of people.Global temperatures graphEl Ni\u00f1o usually brings more flooding in the south of the US, the south of South America, the Horn of Africa and central Asia, while severe heatwaves and droughts often strike eastern Australia, Indonesia, south Asia and Central America.El Ni\u00f1o: how the weather event is affecting global heating in 2023Read more\u201cThe onset of El Ni\u00f1o will greatly increase the likelihood of breaking temperature records and triggering more extreme heat in many parts of the world and in the ocean,\u201d said Petteri Taalas, the WMO secretary-general. \u201cThe declaration by WMO is the signal to governments around the world to mobilise preparations. Early warnings and anticipatory action of extreme weather events associated with this major climate phenomenon are vital to save lives and livelihoods.\u201dRecord temperatures have been recorded in recent months. In the UK, the average temperature record for June was beaten by nearly a degree and an unprecedented heatwave hit the country\u2019s seas. Sea ice around Antarctica has also hit a record low.00:03:14What you need to know about the 'extreme' heatwave hitting our oceans \u2013 video explainerScientists said this was the climate crisis playing out as they had warned, rather than an unanticipated surge in heating. Some researchers think El Ni\u00f1o could drive 2023 to become the hottest recorded year, though the greater pulse of heat will appear in 2024.ChartA recent report by the WMO and the UK Met Office estimated a 66% chance of global annual temperatures exceeding pre-industrial levels by 1.5C for at least one year by 2027.\u201cThis is not to say that in the next five years we would exceed the 1.5C level specified in the Paris agreement because that refers to long-term warming over many years,\u201d said Chris Hewitt, the WMO\u2019s director of climate services. \u201cHowever, it is yet another wake-up call that we are not yet going in the right direction to limit the warming to within the targets designed to substantially reduce the impacts of climate change.\u201d",

If it is clear, the moon and stars illuminate the tiny island vividly; when it is cloudy, the darkness is thick and unbroken, \u201cbible black\u201d to quote Dylan Thomas.Ynys Enlli (Bardsey Island), two miles off the mainland of north-west Wales, has become the first site in Europe to receive international dark sky sanctuary certification, joining just 16 other spots in some of the most remote places in the world.The island (permanent human population two in the winter, about a dozen in the summer) is off-grid and there are hardly any lights outside, with most of the buildings unchanged since they were built in the 19th century.A small mountain shields most of the island from the tiny bit of light that may spill from the mainland, and the closest major light pollution comes from Dublin, more than 70 miles away across the Irish Sea.The lighthouse has been switched from a sweeping white beam to a flashing red light designed not to impinge on the night. It means that when the sun goes down the island is, as the Welsh expression has it, \u201cYn dywyll fel bola buwch\u201d \u2013 \u201cas dark as a cow\u2019s belly\u201d.Mari Huws, who works as a warden on the island with her partner, Emyr Owen, said it was a privilege to live there all year round.The lighthouse at Ynys Enlli has a red light that does not impinge on the night.

So much of nature has evolved to need a dark night sky at night. And there are no disadvantages for us to be living somewhere so dark \u2013 you just need to use a torch.\u201dSian Stacey, the chair of the Bardsey Island Trust, said it had taken several years of hard work to achieve the certification, which is awarded by the Arizona-based International Dark-Sky Association (IDA).\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that achieving this prestigious status for Ynys Enlli will raise the profile of the island as a unique place in Wales and amongst the best in the world to appreciate the night sky,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hope it will also go a long way in securing the long-term sustainability of the island.\u201dYnys Enlli seen from the mainland.

Scientists hope it may encourage agricultural companies and governments in the Amazon and Congo basin regions and south-east Asia to invest more in protecting trees and other vegetation.The study found that the more rainforests are cleared in tropical countries, the less local farmers will be able to depend on rain for their crops and pastures.The paper, published in the journal Nature, adds to fears that the degradation of the Amazon is approaching a tipping point after which the rainforest will no longer be able to generate its own rainfall and the vegetation will dry up.Human activity and drought \u2018degrading more than a third of Amazon rainforest\u2019Read morePeople living in deforested areas have long provided anecdotal evidence that their microclimates became drier with lower tree cover. Scientists already knew that killing trees reduces evapotranspiration and thus theorised this would result in lower local rainfall.The team at Leeds University have now proven this using satellite and meteorological records from 2003-17 across pantropical regions.Even at a small scale, they found an impact, but the decline became more pronounced when the affected area was greater than 50km squared (2,500 sq km). At the largest measured scale of 200km squared (40,000 sq km), the study discovered rainfall was 0.25 percentage points lower each month for every 1 percentage point loss of forest.This can enter into a vicious cycle, as reductions in rainfall lead to further forest loss, increased fire vulnerability and weaker carbon drawdown.One of the authors, Prof Dominick Spracklen of the University of Leeds, said 25% to 50% of the rain that fell in the Amazon came from precipitation recycling by the trees. Although the forest is sometimes described as the \u201clungs of the world\u201d, it functions far more like a heart that pumps water around the region.He said the local impact of this reduced water recycling was far more obvious, immediate and persuasive to governments and corporations in the global south than arguments about carbon sequestration, which was seen as having more benefits to industrial countries in the northern hemisphere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

For the Congo basin, they estimated a rainfall decline of 16mm a month by the end of the century based on projections of forest loss.In all regions, the consequences are likely to be felt in cities and farm fields hundreds or thousands of kilometres outside the cleared forest. The study notes that crop yields could decline by 1.25% for each 10 percentage point loss of forest cover.",

Six staff from the Foreign Office (FCDO) and four British Red Cross workers were at the airport to help travellers, he said.Other peers said unless the Foreign Office changed its travel advice, many Britons with holidays coming up would not be able to cancel them and receive refunds, at a time when budgets were strained amid the cost of living crisis.Courtown said: \u201cThe FCDO travel advice should not impact people\u2019s ability to claim insurance for things like cancelled hotel bookings or flight changes, depending on their policy and level of cover.

Christian Aid estimates the UK\u2019s \u201cfair share\u201d of this to be about 3.5%, or $15bn.The charity says a wealth tax of the kind envisaged in its report would affect the top 5% of households, with the burden disproportionately borne by the top 1%. \u201cThis has the advantage of being levied on those who are likely to be disproportionately high polluters in their consumption and personal investment,\u201d the report says.The entire sum could also be raised through a tax of up to 95% on the excess profits of fossil fuel companies, which are enjoying all-time record surpluses, the report suggests. Or the money could be raised through a combination of measures including air passenger levies, emissions trading schemes and an expanded financial transactions tax, according to the report.Nushrat Rahman Chowdhury, Christian Aid\u2019s climate justice policy adviser, who wrote the report, said: \u201cClimate change is the biggest issue of global injustice facing the world today. Some of the people that have done the least to cause it are experiencing the most terrible consequences. How we address that injustice fairly is at the heart of international climate negotiations.\u201dNo country has yet agreed how much they will contribute towards the loss and damage fund.

        "text": "\u201cWe remain committed to executing our strategy,\u201d said Murray Auchincloss, BP\u2019s stand-in chief executive, for the umpteenth time since Bernard Looney was defenestrated as permanent boss seven weeks ago. Auchincloss\u2019s problem is that repetition doesn\u2019t make it more convincing in the eyes of a sceptical market. Investors were already wondering if Looney would bow to pressure to water down his green transition plans further. Now it\u2019s open season for speculation about BP\u2019s future. Takeover target? Breakup candidate? There is an air of instability.That is partly because the two biggest US oil majors are seemingly more confident than ever in their hydrocarbons-for-longer strategies. ExxonMobil is buying the US shale group Pioneer for $60bn (\u00a349bn) and Chevron is making a record purchase by paying $53bn for Hess, complete with access to Guyana\u2019s offshore oil reserves. Both deals are a case of doubling down on fossil fuels, which naturally provokes a fresh round of muttering among a few BP investors about whether renewables will ever earn the same returns on capital as oil and gas. BP\u2019s shares are persistently priced at a valuation discount to those of the US majors.Nor will the mood be improved by the $540m impairment charge in offshore wind in BP\u2019s weak third-quarter numbers on Tuesday, the result of New York authorities rejecting a request to renegotiate terms on two local projects. That will heighten worries about the effect on inflation on other BP wind projects in the UK and Germany.Meanwhile, if the pursuit of size and synergies is suddenly the game again in Big Oil, some wonder if a takeover by Shell, first rumoured about two decades ago, would fit the bill. Alternatively, the undervaluation might be solved by a demerger, separating the oil and gas assets from the newer low-carbon ventures, suggested Nick Butler, a former BP executive and a visiting professor at King\u2019s College London, on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Tuesday.Anything can happen, of course. But, before joining the rush to declare that BP requires a radical fix or strategic U-turn, here are a few reasons why now looks to be the wrong moment to hit the panic button.First, BP\u2019s valuation discount to US rivals hasn\u2019t got worse over the past year. There\u2019s still a discount to Shell, but it\u2019s not yawning. Second, it\u2019s not as if Exxon and Chevron have been cheered from the rafters for their splashy deals. Both companies\u2019 share prices have fallen since the announcement of their acquisitions; the market may be worrying that the takeover action is happening at the top of the cycle (it wouldn\u2019t be the first time).Third, BP\u2019s current strategy cannot be described as a reckless bet-the-farm gamble on renewables. Even by 2030, the company projects that about three-quarters of its earnings will be coming from hydrocarbons. The \u201ctransition growth engines\u201d \u2013 primarily biofuels, EV charging, hydrogen and renewables generation \u2013 are pencilled in for $10bn-$12bn of annual earnings (v about $1.5bn today) out of a group total of $53bn-$58bn at the end of this decade. Oil and gas production in the US, which is roughly what BP means by concentrating on high-quality barrels, will actually increase over the period.For those investors who still think oil companies can recycle their expertise into low-carbon technology \u2013 not everybody is a believer, of course \u2013 BP offers the choice of a different blend of assets. The real investment uncertainty is whether the returns from the low- and zero-carbon will materialise. On that score, it\u2019s surely too soon to make a definitive call.Yes, returns on capital of 15%-plus from biofuels and EV charging sound punchy; \u201cdouble digits\u201d from hydrogen is speculative since the business is in its infancy; and 6%-8% from renewable power (before financial leverage is applied) comes with a question mark now that the share prices of pure-play wind operators are tumbling. But BP has only been travelling down this long-term road for about three years in serious fashion. Give the strategy time to succeed or fail. If the numbers don\u2019t stack up in practice, the moment for a U-turn is a couple of years away.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Children\u2019s lungs can\u2019t wait,\u201d says Jemima Hartshorn, a Brixton resident who helped set up campaign group Mums For Lungs.London\u2019s filthy air makes chronic illnesses worse, shortens life expectancy and damages lung development in children. Levels of nitrogen dioxide, mostly produced by diesel vehicles, have been illegally high since 2010 in the vast majority of urban areas in the UK. Noxious emissions make chronic illnesses worse and shorten life expectancy, typically by six months.A spokesperson for the mayor said: \u201cLondon\u2019s toxic air increases the risk of asthma and dementia and can damage children\u2019s lung growth. The mayor has delivered a series of hard-hitting measures to tackle our filthy air, from cleaning up the bus fleet to introducing a toxicity charge in central London for the most polluting vehicles. A vital step will be the introduction of the ultra-low emission zone in April next year, which will be the toughest emission standard adopted by any city in the world and will improve air quality for millions of Londoners.\u201dLondon's ultra-low emission zone: what you need to knowRead moreSimon Alcock, head of public affairs at Client Earth, a firm of environmental lawyers, says the city has \u201cno choice\u201d but to bring in the ULEZ because of the already illegal levels of NOx in the city\u2019s air. \u201cIf water was as dirty as our air, we would have taken action much earlier,\u201d he says.Earlier this year, the high court ruled that the government\u2019s current policy on air pollution was unlawful, and ordered changes.But Alcock acknowledges the issues faced by diesel drivers.\u201cEveryone was encouraged to buy diesels by successive governments as they thought it was good for climate change. But it was really bad for your health. I think it\u2019s really important that we help drivers to make the shift, through scrappage schemes or making electric vehicles cheaper to buy.\u201dThe case against: \u2018The poorest will be hit hardest\u2019The ULEZ charges will be \u201cSadiq Khan\u2019s poll tax\u201d, warns Gareth Bacon, leader of the Conservatives in the Greater London Assembly.\u201cThe introduction of a daily \u00a312.50 charge simply to use their cars, when they had previously done so without incurring any charge (other than the usual cost of motoring, which is not cheap in the UK) is going to come as a shock to a great many people,\u201d he says.He is supportive of the original central London ULEZ proposed by Boris Johnson, but with an implementation date of 2020, and is opposed to the 2021 expansion of the ULEZ to cover a bigger area.\u201cIt will impact huge numbers of people. More than 3.5 million people live inside this zone and many more pass through it on a daily basis. The zone boundary dissects a dozen London boroughs and residents will suddenly find short trips to, for example, do the weekly shopping, take their child to school or to attend a hospital appointment costing them an additional \u00a312.50 per trip. For those living inside the zone, it will cost them \u00a312.50 every time they turn on their ignition \u2013 if they need to drive their car every day, that is the equivalent of an additional tax burden of \u00a34,500 per year. The people hit hardest will be the poorest because many will not be able to afford to upgrade their vehicle.\u201dMeanwhile, one petition on Change.org, which now has more than 25,000 signatures, claims that the ULEZ is \u201ca stealth tax and nothing to do with air pollution!

        "text": "A new study of New Zealand\u2019s freshwater quality has painted a sobering picture, showing that E coli is seeping through three-quarters of the land and into waterways at higher levels than national regulations allow.The report, funded by the government-backed organisation Our Land and Water, looked at how rivers, lakes, and estuaries are polluted by four major contaminants, including E coli, a bacteria found in the intestines of many animals and humans that can cause serious illness.Only 2% of New Zealand\u2019s large lakes are in good health, bleak report findsRead moreIt highlights the challenge New Zealand faces in bringing contaminant levels down in line with the guidelines outlined in the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management.\u201cThe big picture that we see in terms of water quality is the impact of agriculture, which is quite ubiquitous because agriculture occupies about 35% of our total land use,\u201d said Ton Snelder, director of LWP, a company involved in creating the report.\u201cThere are other land uses in particular, urban land use that can also have quite a significant impact on water quality,\u201d he said.Along with E. coli, the report looked at levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment at 850 water monitoring sites across the country and modelled how those contaminates might affect New Zealand\u2019s 650,000 river segments, 961 lakes and 419 estuaries. Nitrogen and phosphorus naturally occur in soil, but dangerous levels are often attributed to farming byproducts, such as cattle urine. Sediment is another naturally occurring pollutant that can reach unhealthy levels due to human-caused erosion as well as urban and agricultural land use.The report found that substantial reductions of at least one of the four contaminants were required in almost all regions of the country to meet national regulations. Maps generated by the report\u2019s data demonstrate the human impact on waterways \u2013 the sparsely populated west coast of New Zealand\u2019s South Island shows low levels of the contaminants. However, areas such as Canterbury, which has intensive dairy farming, and Auckland, the country\u2019s largest city, show high levels of either nitrogen or E. coli.Reducing contaminants falls to local councils, which are required to regulate farms and urban areas to improve freshwater. Richard McDowell, a chief scientist at Our Land and Water and professor at Lincoln University, said nitrogen and phosphorus in waterways can decrease when farmers use less fertiliser and ensure cattle effluent from dairy sheds does not run into waterways.Land use change, such as switching from dairy to forestry or crops where suitable, can improve water quality, McDowell said, acknowledging the balance between environmental and social challenges. In recent years, farmers have blamed rural unemployment on high numbers of cattle farms converting to forestry.Unrelated to the study, New Zealand has seen a handful of swimming areas off-limits due to water pollution. Traces of human faeces were recently found in the waters of Corsair Bay, a popular Christchurch swimming spot. In Auckland, a burst sewage pipe near the Hauraki Gulf spewed raw sewage into the harbour for weeks until the issue was temporarily fixed. In parts of the upmarket mountain town of Queenstown, a \u201cboil water notice has been in place since mid-September due to an outbreak of cryptosporidium, which can cause diarrhoea and stomach cramps. The likely cause is human or animal faeces.",

The chief veterinary officer confirmed the decision, after a new assessment of the risk of avian influenza.As a result, boxes of eggs will be able to once again be labelled \u201cfree range\u201d.Eggs cannot be classed as free range if the birds that have laid them have been kept indoors for longer than 16 weeks. After that time, eggs are required to be called barn eggs.An outbreak of H5N1 bird flu was first confirmed in the UK in late October 2021, and accelerated during 2022. Officials have said the disease circulates among wild birds, but it is also deadly for captive birds including hens and turkeys.Outbreaks are devastating for farmers because they sweep through flocks, and prompt a cull of birds that have not succumbed to the illness.While the lifting of the housing order has been widely welcomed, officials are warning bird keepers to keep biosecurity measures in place to prevent future outbreaks.Dr Christine Middlemiss, the UK\u2019s chief veterinary officer, said: \u201cThe unprecedented nature of this outbreak has proved it\u2019s more important than ever for bird keepers to remain vigilant for signs of disease and maintain stringent standards of biosecurity.\u201dThe decision to allow poultry and other birds outside again, as the risks from bird flu reduce, does not remove all of the pressure facing egg producers.Since the start of the war in Ukraine last February, the cost of animal feed and energy has skyrocketed. Egg producers\u2019 energy bills were further increased by the need to keep animals indoors in lit and heated barns over the winter.In addition, the cost of fuel, packaging and labour increased significantly in 2022 and has not fallen so far this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added: \u201cThere is only one way to go: petrol and diesel cars out. Active, shared and electric mobility in.\u201d\u2018It was war\u2019: school-run parents tackle petrol crisis traffic chaosRead morePlans for the central London Ulez were unveiled in 2017 and a year later Khan announced it would be rolled out to the north and south circular \u2013 a ring road around the capital.Under the scheme, the expanded version of which comes into force on Monday, the most polluting vehicles will be charged \u00a312.50 a day for cars, vans and motorbikes and \u00a3100 for coaches and HGVs. Petrol vehicles registered before 2005 and diesel vehicles before 2015 are likely to be liable for the charge.Worldwide air pollution is cutting short the lives of billions of people by up to six years, making it a far greater killer than smoking, car crashes or HIV/Aids. A battery of recent scientific reports reveal it could be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body and is responsible for 8.8 million early deaths each year.Last year, a study found health costs of air pollution from roads are higher in London than any other city in Europe with children and older people often hit worst.According to the study, there was a 15% reduction in diesel cars in London from 2017-20 \u2013 more than six times the trend seen elsewhere in the UK. This fall in polluting diesels has contributed to a drastic reduction in toxic air in the capital, with a 94% fall in the number of people living in areas with illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide between 2016 and 2019.Clean air campaigners have welcomed the expansion of the zone, which will come into force on Monday. Jemima Hartshorn, the founder of the campaign group Mums for Lungs, said the expanded zone would shield millions more Londoners from toxic air. \u201cThis is a significant moment in our fight for kids to breathe clean air. The mayor must continue pushing to get toxic diesel off our streets and protect our children\u2019s health.\u201dThere are concerns that many motorists do not understand the detail of the pending changes and campaigners are calling on the mayor to support the least well off to move away from older, polluting vehicles.Although clean air campaigners and those concerned about the climate crisis have welcomed the Ulez expansion, many are angry that the mayor is still pushing ahead with a new four-lane road tunnel under the Thames.Critics of the \u00a32bn Silvertown tunnel scheme, including climate scientists, senior Labour politicians and doctors, say the huge road-building programme will worsen air pollution and lock in high-carbon transport for generations.Victoria Rance, from the Stop the Silvertown Tunnel campaign, said: \u201cWhile we welcome the expansion of Ulez, the mayor can not be taken seriously on climate or air pollution as long as he insists on pushing ahead with this project.\u201dHowever the mayor\u2019s office insisted the tunnel was necessary, would improve public transport across the Thames and would not hinder efforts to improve air pollution or tackle carbon emissions.",

He was told: \u201cYou must seek advice in relation to each client, so that risks can be assessed and it will need to be demonstrated by you and Defra [the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs] that the work would be appropriate under the rules.\u201dAcoba concluded it would \u201cnot be improper\u201d for Eustice, who was sacked by Liz Truss in a cabinet reshuffle last September, to set up a consultancy drawing on experience gained from his time as a minister and previously in the agri-food industry.Although he had been a Defra minister for more than nine years, including two as environment secretary under Boris Johnson, he has already been out of office for 11 months and there have been two prime ministers, and accompanying policy changes, since his tenure.The former minister, who announced in January that he was leaving politics, told Acoba he had gained much of his technical knowledge before joining government \u2013 from his time as a farmer and also as an MP on the environment committee \u2013 and would not take work that involved direct contact with ministers or officials.However, in a letter published on the Acoba website, the watchdog\u2019s chair, Eric Pickles, told him: \u201cDespite these mitigating factors, there remain risks around your privileged insight and influence could be seen to offer an unfair advantage to future clients.\u201cGiven your role as the minister responsible for the UK\u2019s policy in the areas you wish to work in, there are also inherent risks that you could offer your clients unfair access to government, or make use of contacts you gained in office but outside government to gain business for your consultancy.\u201dHe added: \u201cYou will have had oversight of a wide range of information, policy, and made decisions that may provide an unfair advantage to a broad range of organisations.\u201cThe committee considered there is a significant risk that your clients, particularly those in the agri-food industry, water and waste sectors, may be considered to gain from your privileged insight and decisions made in office that are unavailable to its competitors.\u201dEustice announced in January that he was standing down as the MP for Camborne and Redruth after 15 years in parliament as he wanted to have another career outside politics.

        "text": "Understanding air pollution of the past may be key to explaining some of the health inequalities that persist between different parts of the UK. Paintings by Lowry, Constable, Monet and Turner show how our skies were often filled with haze and smoke, but we have few measurements to understand how much pollution was in the air and what it was made of.Dr Ann Power, of the University of Exeter, has been looking for evidence of past air pollution in the mud of urban and agricultural ponds. \u201cWe wanted to understand how exposure to urban air pollution has changed over the last 200 years as our towns and cities have evolved since the Industrial Revolution. We focused on the Merseyside region due to its industrial past and present-day high rates of long-term illness,\u201d she said.Investigations of historical air pollution often involve considerable creativity. Previous studies have tracked air pollution through the early 20th century by examining the soot-stained feathers of stuffed birds from museum collections, and others have used 18th-century measurements of the electrical properties of the atmosphere made by amateur weather enthusiasts.In her research, Power paddled a small inflatable boat around ornamental and agricultural ponds in Merseyside. All were present in maps from the 1800s. The largest was less than half the size of a football pitch, and the smallest were less than a few metres across. She used ropes to tether her boat in the middle of each pond and carefully leaned over the side to drill into the sediment.Individual ponds told the story of the air pollution around them, but many trends were common across the whole region. Lead was found in the pond muds. This increased rapidly from the 1970 sediment until lead additives in petrol were controlled and finally banned in the late 1990s.Sulphur in the pond mud declined from the 1970s, reflecting the slow rollout of smoke control areas, the availability of fossil gas to replace coal and progressive controls on industry. Zinc and copper could be matched to the opening of foundries and the modern expansion of vehicle manufacturing. Fly ash particles reflected the operations of former coal-fired power stations, including those at Bold and Fiddlers Ferry.Oglet pond is smaller than a tennis court and is located in a field close to the runway of Liverpool\u2019s John Lennon airport. The airport was opened in 1933, with a converted farmhouse as a terminal building. It is much busier today. Passenger numbers have increased nearly tenfold since the 1990s and the impact can be seen in the lake mud. Power found a distinct change in the magnetic properties of particles found in the sediment since 1995, which now match the types of particles produced from aircraft engines.Notable across all of the ponds was a change that took place in the 1980s with the shift to smaller combustion-derived particles exposing people to a form of air pollution not seen in the 150 years before.Prof Barbara Maher, of the University of Lancaster, who was not involved in the ponds study, said: \u201c\u2018The switch to smaller, metal-rich air pollution particles, as observed in these pond sediments, over the last 40 years may pose a particular hazard to human health. We have found distinctively rounded magnetite nanoparticles, together with exotic metals, in human brains, hearts and placental cells. These match perfectly those found in urban air pollution and their ingress to major organs is a biologically plausible pathway for the links between particulate air pollution, cardiorespiratory and neurodegenerative diseases.\u201dProf John Love, of the University of Exeter, said: \u201cThe air may seem clean but it\u2019s not. The visible pollution, the large soot and smog of the past, has become smaller and therefore invisible but no less harmful. The message from this study is not to be complacent about air quality.\u201d",

Sign up here to read more exclusive pieces like this and for a digest of the week\u2019s biggest environment stories every ThursdayIt feels impossible. The world has to slash carbon emissions by almost half in the next seven years to remain on track for just 1.5C of global heating and avoid the worst of climate impacts. Yet emissions are rising.However, tucked away in the recent (and devastating) landmark report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a chart that provides the road map for an escape from catastrophe. It assesses with extraordinary clarity the potential for emissions cuts of more than 40 options. You can view it here.The simplicity of the chart is deceptive. It was compiled by a team of the world\u2019s best scientists, based on 175 studies. Its power is amplified by the fact that it was signed off by all of the world\u2019s governments, from the cleanest and greenest to the darkest petrostates.So what does it show? First, solar and wind power are by far the best option, with the potential to cut a staggering 8bn tonnes from annual CO2 emissions by 2030. That is equivalent to the combined emissions of the US and European Union today. Even more startling is that most of that potential can be achieved at lower cost than just continuing with today\u2019s electricity systems.\u201cWhat struck me especially was that wind and solar was so big,\u201d Prof Kornelis Blok, at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, told me this week. Blok, who led the work on the chart, identified the winners: \u201cThe big five are wind, solar, energy efficiency, stopping deforestation and reducing methane emissions.\u201dJust as important as the winners in this analysis are the losers. Nuclear power and carbon capture and storage (CCS) each have just 10% of the potential of wind and solar, and at far higher cost. The same applies to bioenergy \u2013 burning wood or crops for electricity. It\u2019s no wonder that the UK\u2019s energy strategy, published last week, received significant criticism: it goes heavy on nuclear and CCS, while ignoring onshore wind.After wind and solar, the biggest prize is stopping the destruction of forests and other wild places, the IPCC scientists found. That has the potential to cut 4bn tonnes of emissions a year by 2030, not far off double the fossil fuel emissions from the whole of Africa and South America today. Including the restoration of degraded forests adds almost 3bn tonnes. Much of this could be achieved for less than $50 per tonne \u2013 half the price polluters pay for carbon permits in Europe today.Energy efficiency in buildings, industry, lighting and appliances remains a no-brainer \u2013 4.5bn tonnes a year by 2030 \u2013 as does slashing methane emissions, particularly from leaky fossil fuel installations. The latter could save the equivalent of about 3bn tonnes.There are some interesting details too. A shift to \u201csustainable diets\u201d \u2013 ie eating much less red meat in rich nations \u2013 could cut 1.7bn tonnes of emissions, equivalent to all the annual pollution from fossil fuel giant Russia. A push towards public transport, bikes and e-bikes has the potential to cut emissions more than the rollout of electric cars, showing both are needed. An often overlooked option \u2013 burying charcoal in fields (biochar) \u2013 is relatively costly to implement but potentially huge. Along with avoiding the ploughing of fields, which releases carbon, biochar could save 3.4bn tonnes of CO2 a year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It shows we can cut emissions by half by 2030 with options costing at most $100 per tonne, which is a bargain when set against the further damages that climate inaction will inevitably bring.The solutions \u2013 wind, solar, trees, energy saving and methane cuts \u2013 require no new technology. But what they do require is a resource heavily lacking so far: the political will to push aside vested interests and rapidly pursue the policies that will work.\u201cThe chart is a very useful hitlist,\u201d says Blok. \u201cI think every country can take it and see in which areas they could do more. If we don\u2019t achieve [a 50% cut in emissions by 2030], it will not be because of a lack of options.\u201d",

An airport-commissioned peer-reviewed health assessment concluded that for locations within 15km from the airport, the severity of potential health effects on schools and childcare centres would be \u201cmoderate\u201d.Brimbank council, which includes suburbs directly south of the airport, has also flagged the importance of a possible compensation scheme to reduce the impact of aircraft noise for communities near the airport.The airport is planning for the 3km runway to be operating by the end of the decade to help meet demand, with passenger numbers anticipated to double to 83 million a year by 2046. It is designed to ease pressure on a system that was frequently plagued by delays at peak times before Covid.Melbourne airport had planned to build a third runway running east-west, but in 2019 it switched to a north-south plan due to wind interference.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "The prospect of higher taxes is not usually viewed with joy by British businesses, or Conservative MPs \u2013 but when it comes to carbon, that is precisely what many are asking for.A growing number of manufacturers, Tory MPs and experts are calling for charges to be levied on the carbon emissions associated with imports. They believe the levy is needed to create a level playing field that would enable UK companies to invest in cutting their greenhouse gas emissions, without finding themselves undercut by lower-cost but higher-carbon imports from overseas.Jerome Mayhew, a Tory member of the environmental audit committee, is convinced the charge will prove popular in his party, despite misgivings among some of his colleagues. \u201cApplying a cost to carbon unlocks the power of the free market to find cheaper, lower-carbon production techniques,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cAs Conservatives, promoting free trade and free markets is within our DNA.\u201dManufacturers will face higher costs for investment in new equipment and processes as the UK moves to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Without a carbon levy, those companies trying to do the right thing would see their costs rise while imports from countries lacking stringent green regulations prospered, resulting in higher emissions overall and damaging the climate and the UK economy.With a carbon levy, known as a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), those overseas manufacturers, in countries such as China, would have an added incentive to cut their carbon footprints and join the green race.Traditionally, though, some Tories have taken the view that a charge on imports would be protectionist. Rishi Sunak, when he was chancellor of the exchequer, roundly rejected the idea of a CBAM, deriding it as likely to raise prices.But his successor in the Treasury, Jeremy Hunt, is understood to look far more favourably on the measure \u2013 not least because the EU has brought in its new CBAM, now under trial, that will impose heavy additional costs on UK businesses unless the government responds with one of its own.A proposal for a trial levy may form part of Hunt\u2019s promised response to the US Inflation Reduction Act, Joe Biden\u2019s $369bn package to galvanise green industry. Hunt\u2019s conclusions will be presented alongside the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement next week.Several Tory MPs told the Guardian they would back such a plan. Tim Loughton, a member of the home affairs select committee, said developments in China, the EU and the US demanded it.\u201cThe great strides we have made in decarbonising have boosted the UK\u2019s international standing and given us a headstart in developing green industries,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we are not the only country that recognises the economic opportunity of decarbonising. Without a CBAM, we risk offshoring manufacturing to China, where huge amounts of carbon-intensive goods are still being produced using their coal-dominated power gird. Chinese goods previously intended for the EU could flood into our country as a result of [the EU\u2019s] CBAM.\u201dRobert Buckland, a former minister, said the proceeds of the levy could be put to good use within the UK. \u201cCBAM will take further financial burdens off the taxpayer and put them on the polluter, [as] the revenue can be recycled for domestic net zero projects or support households with energy bills,\u201d he noted.Manufacturers tend to agree. Polling commissioned by the thinktank E3G found that almost two-thirds (64%) of respondents to a survey of 400 people in upper management roles in UK manufacturing were supportive of the UK taxing high-polluting imports in order to incentivise countries with lower environmental standards to limit their emissions.Sam Hall, the director of the Conservative Environment Network, urged Hunt to bring in a CBAM that would focus first on energy-intensive businesses that have big carbon footprints and are especially liable to being undercut by imports. This could include steel, chemicals and other heavy industry.He also called for exemptions for imports from the poorer developing countries, to ensure their goods were not penalised unfairly. \u201cThere remains an active debate around the design of CBAMs,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] good design can deal with many of the potential objections.\u201d",

Extreme heat has been associated with triggering earlier deliveries and an increase in stillbirths.The report said the climate crisis exacerbated existing inequalities. In east and southern Africa, for example, tropical cyclones have damaged health facilities, disrupting access to maternal health services and helping spread waterborne diseases such as cholera.Hurricanes and droughts increase the risks of gender-based violence and child marriage, it added, as families under stress are less able to support daughters and seek to marry them off.Angela Baschieri, an adviser on population and development for UNFPA and one of the report\u2019s authors, said: \u201cIf we look at the plan of action for women and girls, national plans show there is more work that could be done.\u201cWe know climate change disproportionately affects women and is not gender neutral so there is a need to address those gaps and impacts.\u201dCop26: Women must be heard on climate, say rights groupsRead moreThe report highlighted the countries that are taking action. Paraguay, Seychelles and Benin have specified the need to build climate-resilient health systems allowing women to give birth safely and access health services.Nine countries, including El Salvador, Sierra Leone and Guinea, have included policies or interventions to address gender-based violence.Only Dominica has mentioned the need for contraception, despite evidence of disruptions to family-planning services during climate-related disasters.Vietnam is the only country to acknowledge that child marriage occurs more often during times of crises as families seek to reduce their economic burden (for example, marriages of girls aged 11 to 14 increased by half in Bangladesh in years with a heatwave lasting a month).\u201cClimate is setting us back on the fight to gender equality. Our point would be to make sure that climate policy recognises the differential impact on women and takes it into account in the design of policy,\u201d said Baschieri.",

This is clear in the investment trends, where clean technologies are pulling away from fossil fuels.\u201cIn very simple, but very striking terms, five years ago global energy investment was $2tn, of which $1tn was for clean energy and $1tn was for fossil fuels. Today, $1tn is for fossil fuels and $1.7tn is for clean energy. This is a dramatic shift which will have consequences for the energy markets and climate change. In my view, it\u2019s very exciting.\u201dThe clean energy boom is particularly apparent in solar power investment, Birol said. \u201cFor the first time in history the amount of investment going to solar is higher than the amount going to oil production. It may be symbolic but it is very important because it shows the tide turning,\u201d he said.Clean energy investment has climbed steadily in recent years as governments and investors have sought to take advantage of the low cost of renewables such as wind and solar power.In contrast, investment in fossil fuels plunged during the Covid-19 pandemic when severe travel restrictions caused demand for transport fuels to plummet, leading to a collapse in energy commodity prices.The IEA report showed that clean energy investment has accelerated well beyond spending on gas, coal and oil as governments become increasingly concerned about developing secure, homegrown energy sources.However, the IEA report warned that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine has also prompted increased investment in upstream oil and gas, which is expected to rise by 7% in 2023 in a return to 2019 levels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If you cannot reduce permitting time we will not be able to see the rapid expansion of renewables,\u201d he said.In the UK, developers of renewable energy projects have complained that they have been forced to wait for more than a decade to connect to the electricity grid.",

The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said the climate crisis remained of \u201cutmost importance\u201d.But the special representative in post from 2013-17, Prof Sir David King, said: \u201cThis is extremely disappointing. It\u2019s a very backward step. I do hope that the government has second thoughts and gets a very strong person into this position.\u201dKing said he had made 96 official country visits in the two years before the Paris climate agreement was signed in 2015, enabling the UK government to play a leading role in achieving the deal. \u201cThe important thing is that the climate change situation is far, far worse now than it was in 2015,\u201d he said.Tom Burke, a former adviser to the first special representative, John Ashton, who was appointed in 2006, said: \u201cThe [loss of the post] will clearly be interpreted everywhere as a reduction in Britain\u2019s political focus on climate change.\u201cThe government is strengthening [climate work] inside the structure of the FCDO department, but the fact is that without somebody who\u2019s got the foreign secretary\u2019s approval, and the rank of ambassador more or less, you don\u2019t get access to the key players. So it will limit Britain\u2019s ability to influence other countries on climate change.\u201dBurke, now chair of the thinktank E3G, added: \u201cAll of the really difficult problems in dealing with climate change are the politics, not the technology or economics. And in order to make a difference in the politics, you have to have access to the key top-level decision-makers in countries.\u201dAn FCDO spokesperson said: \u201cClimate change remains an area of utmost importance to this government, and to the foreign secretary, and is a central focus of our diplomatic relations on a daily basis. Our resource and senior representation on climate and environment has grown significantly since the creation of the FCDO, and expanded further since the UK\u2019s Cop26 presidency.\u201dThe foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said in 2020: \u201cClimate change is a huge global challenge.\u201d He also attended the UN\u2019s climate summit Cop27 in Egypt in November.Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson on climate change, said: \u201cThe decision to eliminate the special representative is a clear indication that Rishi Sunak refuses to take the climate crisis seriously. Instead of investing in the expertise and leadership necessary to address one of the greatest threats facing our planet, they have chosen once again to bury their heads in the sand. This position must be reinstated immediately.\u201dThe Guardian reported in 2018 that the number of full-time officials dedicated to the climate crisis in the Foreign Office had dropped by almost 25% since 2016 under the then foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. The FCDO declined to share the current number of its climate staff.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I want my child to be able to experience the same environment and the same culture that I grew up in,\u201d said Cynthia Houniuhi, also of Solomon Islands and who is president of PISFCC. \u201cThe environment that sustains us is disintegrating before our eyes.\u201dFrustrated by the world\u2019s lack of action on climate change, law students in eight Pacific island nations founded PISFCC in 2019 and launched their campaign to persuade their leaders to take the resolution to the UN\u2019s highest court.Spearheaded by Vanuatu, Pacific nations soon took up the law students\u2019 call.Pacific Island nations are at risk of rising seas engulfing swathes of the islands. Scientists say both extreme weather and sea levels have worsened because of climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The resolution asks the court to pay particular attention to the harm endured by small island states.Vanuatu prime minister Ishmael Kalsakau greeted the resolution as \u201ca win for climate justice of epic proportions.\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s historic resolution is the beginning of a new era in multilateral climate cooperation, one that is more fully focused on upholding the rule of international law and an era that places human rights and intergenerational equity at the forefront of climate decision-making,\u201d he said.\u2018We are very vulnerable\u2019: cyclone-hit Vanuatu pins climate hopes on UN voteRead moreUN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he hoped the opinion, when issued, would encourage nations \u201cto take the bolder and stronger climate action that our world so desperately needs\u201d.While the opinion from the ICJ will not be binding, it will encourage states \u201cto actually go back and look at what they haven\u2019t been doing and what they need to do\u201d to address the climate emergency, said Nilufer Oral, director at the Center for International Law at the University of Singapore.The court has other power it can bring to bear, Christopher Bartlett, climate diplomacy manager for the government of Vanuatu, explained. The court can reference other international legal instruments, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and those do have the force of law for the countries that have ratified them.\u201cThe international court of justice is the only legal authority that has a mandate to look at all of international law. While the advisory opinion itself is not binding, the laws upon which the advisory opinion will be speaking absolutely are legally binding and immediately applicable to states,\u201d said Bartlett.Bartlett said that some of the questions the ICJ will ask include: what harm to the climate has been done? Should states be forced to take certain actions? And is financial support a legal consequence of causing harm?The resolution now goes to the court.Countries have agreed to aim to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius with an upper limit of 2 degrees Celsius back in 2015 as part of the Paris Agreement. The agreement asks countries to submit their plans to curb greenhouse gases to the UN and regularly revise and update those plans.Clarifying those obligations for states, as well as other promises to protect biodiversity and strengthen domestic policies are the main aims of the advisory opinion, said Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu\u2019s climate change minister.\u201cWe are also clear eyed that existing international frameworks have significant gaps,\u201d he said, adding that the opinion could push for stronger legal measures like negotiating a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty or criminalising \u201cclimate destroying activities\u201d.With Associated Press",

It is precisely that, too, stretching from Machynlleth in the north to Bannau Brycheiniog in the south. I drive round to the headwaters of Afon Irfon and set off through forestry plantation, on a short approach best suited to a winter ascent.Bramblings glide among the wood margins, conspicuously white-rumped, their repetitive call-notes plangent and piercing among the silence of the trees. Atop an isolated spruce, a crossbill chips its response. Few footprints mark the snow beyond the moor gate. Its pristine surface is gold-stippled by clumps of rushes. Tracks of hares thread between them. I labour across Blaen Gwesyn to Drygarn\u2019s rocky summit ridge, climb to the higher easternmost summit and rest my back against its mighty cairn. It\u2019s 10 feet tall, perhaps 60 in circumference, visible for miles around. Its gleaming white quartzite core is concealed within a pebbly grey conglomerate cladding, damaged here and there by Ordnance Survey activity. Quartzite cores are a feature of old Welsh hilltop cairns. And quartzite, common though it might be, is a rock that\u2019s often recruited for usage at ritual sites, and not just in Wales.The landscape around Drygarn Fawr, Powys. Photograph: Jim PerrinI\u2019m reminded of taking a boat out from Elu Inlet in the high Arctic and landing on a beach of fine white sand. Above it were traces of an old Thule camp fully a millennium old: meat caches, fox traps, hut shelters. One of these shelters was roofed with a slab of fine-grained granite furred with black lichen. Peering beneath, I saw what threw the slab\u2019s weight so precisely across an angle of cliff edge: a small cube of rose quartz. This piece of engineering was poignantly redolent of human ingenuity in a harsh and exigent landscape. I could have pivoted the slab, reached in, and pocketed it. But that would have robbed others of the opportunity to marvel.A crucial lesson in our brutally acquisitive society, and one that the Thule culture \u2013 which shared all it had \u2013 knew many centuries ago. Back in the present, a glance at my quartz watch tells me it is time to descend.

It found that the government\u2019s net zero strategy was unlawful due to a breach of the 2008 Climate Change Act, given the document did not outline how climate policies would meet legally binding carbon budgets.Campaigners have called for regulation to be cut for new clean energy projects in order to speed up Britain\u2019s energy independence and for potential savings to be passed on to consumers.Sunak told reporters on his way to a trilateral meeting with the Australian and US leaders: \u201cShortly we will be outlining, in the energy security strategy, an approach forward.\u201dHe said it would focus on \u201ccarbon capture and storage, small modular reactors and the like\u201d, and talked up the success of investment in research and development of energy sources such as offshore wind.\u201cI am very confident that we will continue to have a very vibrant set of companies and jobs created in the UK as we transition to net zero, and our track record should give everyone confidence we know how to do this and get it right,\u201d Sunak said.Sam Richards, the founder and campaign director of the \u201cpro-growth\u201d campaign group Britain Remade, blamed Britain\u2019s energy insecurity for \u201csurging energy bills and unsustainable levels of borrowing\u201d.He promoted the benefits of small modular reactors, which the World Economic Forum has identified as a new breed of power source that does not emit greenhouse gases and is less exposed to traditional dangers such as earthquakes and meltdowns.The technology is sparking a renaissance for nuclear energy, with a range of next-generation small modular reactors being developed in the US.However, Richards said they would \u201cnot be delivered at the pace needed without streamlining the regulatory approval process\u201d, and he called for a list of prospective places, including a list of decommissioned nuclear sites, to be drawn up.\u201cThe government will not be able to cut Britain\u2019s dependency on expensive foreign gas and reduce energy bills without reforming the planning system that holds back clean energy infrastructure such as onshore wind, the cheapest form of energy available,\u201d Richards said.\u201cWith the vast majority of major clean energy projects being developed outside London and the south-east, boosting investing in clean energy infrastructure will deliver a significant economic boost and job creation in Britain\u2019s former industrial heartlands across the north and Midlands.\u201d",

The bird\u2019s fearless attitude towards traffic and disregard for authority soon made him a local celebrity, and his fame only grew as Turkules spent weeks outwitting animal control officers.Moose on the loose in Minnesota entrances wildlife watchersRead moreStanding at 3ft tall, with a vibrant red wattle and a wingspan of more than a yard, Turkules claimed a patch of grass, next to a busy road, as his own. He soon became known for his tendency to wander into the road, causing all sorts of commotion.On Facebook and Instagram, people regularly posted photographs and videos of the turkey standing in the middle of a road, preventing cars from passing by fearlessly pecking at tires and flapping his wings. Despite sometimes causing mile-long traffic jams, Turkules was hailed as a sort of West Orange mascot. His popularity was such that on Saturday businesses organized a \u201cHometown Hero\u201d event in Turkules\u2019s honor.But it turns out that the Hometown Hero celebration, during which businesses donated a portion of profits to the Wildlife Conservation Society, was really a goodbye.On Tuesday, the New Jersey department of environmental protection told the Guardian that after a weeks-long effort, Turkules had been captured and relocated to Wharton state forest, 85 miles away.It has left locals bereft.\u201cI\u2019ll miss him a lot. I\u2019ll miss the daily reports on his sightings, I look forward to getting updates about him every day,\u201d said Gia Garcia, who owns Willow and Olivia dessert cafe in West Orange.\u201cWith everything being so tense in the world, political-wise and all that stuff, he came around, and he was the one thing that could just bring the whole town together. No one was arguing about politics, no one\u2019s talking about conflicts that are going on: it was just everyone who just wanted to know if this turkey was still around and was still alive.\u201cHe was just our little uniter. The one thing that makes us smile, the thing that everyone could agree on.\u201dThe wild turkey is native to North America, but almost went extinct in the US in the early 1900s from overhunting. Since then, conservation efforts have led to a population boom, with 7 million nationwide and an estimated 20,000 in New Jersey.As their numbers have grown, wild turkeys have sometimes clashed with humans, particularly in the north-east of the country. Reports of vicious pecking, loud gobbling and even kicking have become increasingly common, as turkeys stake their claim to parks, front yards and even roads.When turkeys misbehave in a town, it falls to state officials to catch the birds. In Turkules\u2019s case, this process took more than a month, including one botched episode in which officials shot the turkey with a tranquilliser dart. The dart struck Turkules, but had zero effect, and he spent weeks wandering about with a blue and orange dart hanging from his breast.\u201cHe is resilient,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cTo see a turkey actively show a type of protective nature for that patch of land, and then for him to walk around with a tranq dart in him, I mean, that\u2019s badass.\u201dAaron Guikema, the New Jersey state director for the Department of Agriculture\u2019s wildlife services program, said that typically about half a dozen wild turkeys have to be removed from residential areas in the state each year \u2013 usually when the birds continually interfere with traffic or otherwise become a nuisance.Turkules proved particularly difficult to capture, Guikema said, because he \u201ctended to fly\u201d more than the average wild turkey.\u201cSo it just made him tougher to catch,\u201d he added.As West Orange mourns the loss of their well-liked bird, some residents believe they may not have seen the last of Turkules. According to local lore, Turkules was previously captured and relocated earlier this year, only to return to the town.\u201cIt\u2019s very sad. He has given the community near and far a reason to come together to hear of his adventures and determination,\u201d said Susan, a West Orange resident who asked that her last name not be used.\u201cBut he is a gangster.

Guardian Australia\u2019s exclusive investigation revealed the proposed Middle Arm industrial development on Darwin harbour would enable the export of gas from the basin, despite the project being labelled a \u201csustainable development precinct\u201d.Drawing on evidence from projects overseas, the report synthesises more than 300 recent peer-reviewed scientific papers on the risks posed by oil and gas operations to biodiversity, water and food security, contributions to the climate emergency, potentially harmful chemicals involved, contamination of air and water, as well as wider health risks associated with the disruption of life near oil and gas fields.NT government accused of lying about meeting climate condition before it greenlit \u2018carbon bomb\u2019 Beetaloo frackingRead moreMelissa Haswell, lead researcher and professor of environmental wellbeing, said government decisions have not taken the health impacts of gas and oil developments seriously enough.

So we know the egg came before the chicken.\u201dThe evidence includes research that shows people living downstream or downwind from the projects experienced health harms, while those in communities upwind or upstream did not, Haswell said.Australia already has a coal seam gas industry, Haswell said, but shale gas mining in the Beetaloo Basin, which is \u201cknocking on our door\u201d, involves drilling three to four kilometres down to where the shale was deposited up to 400m years ago.\u201cSo when they drill and bring up the water, that water contains a whole array of chemicals that have activities that we know if someone\u2019s exposed to them, then there is an increased risk of \u2026 illnesses.\u201dProf Jennifer McKay, an expert in corporate social responsibility and environmental law from the University of South Australia, said the report contains information that is \u201clong overdue to be put into the public domain\u201d.\u201cThe debate has always been skewed by the wrong factors,\u201d McKay said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have medical scientists producing information that is relevant to public decision making and getting that elevated in the decision makers\u2019 minds but also importantly, in the minds of the community who haven\u2019t been seeing often the full arguments.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is managing director of Moorfoot Capital, according to his LinkedIn profile.Douglas-Miller also chaired a charity called the Atlantic Salmon Trust, where Scottish secretary Alister Jack sat on the board and King Charles was the patron.He has attracted criticism from Ramblers Scotland for apparently making it difficult for walkers to access a site at East Lothian\u2019s Lammermuir Hills, which is part of his Hopes estate.The area became increasingly popular with walkers during the pandemic, but the estate brought in a new car park and put up a gate, with access reportedly allowed only three or four days a week and requiring permits bought in advance.In a statement last March, reported by the National, Ramblers Scotland said: \u201cOur members reported that there were only 14 permits a month to be sold, despite the car park having space for 20 cars, and these had immediately sold out.\u201cWe do not believe it is sustainable to continue to create a car park which is only available on certain days and on purchase of a permit.\u201cThis is an indirect obstruction to public access given there is no public transport to this site and it is a long walk from Gifford or surrounding settlements.\u201dJon Moses, from the Right to Roam campaign, criticised the appointment. \u201cThe government have put yet another unelected major landowner \u2026 in charge of our environment and rural affairs.

        "text": "In 2019, the government passed legislation that committed the nation to achieving a goal of net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by the middle of the century. It was one of the most ambitious targets set by any country in the battle to halt the worst effects of climate change. This is a nation committed to limiting global temperature rises, claimed Conservative party leaders.Sadly those proud battle cries and that Churchillian rhetoric have not been matched by action. For the past four years, government departments have failed to put in place any coherent policies that could help limit carbon emissions.Revealed: cabinet ministers warned of legal action over UK\u2019s failure to tackle climate crisisRead moreThis neglect had already become abundantly clear last summer when the high court ruled \u2013 ironically, on one of the hottest days on record in Britain \u2013 that the government\u2019s strategies had failed to meet its obligations to produce a detailed plan for achieving its carbon cut commitments. Little appears to have changed since then.Delivery on net zero was always going to need strong action by all government departments. None passed muster, with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) emerging as one of the worst laggards, with its secretary of state, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, giving the clear impression she simply does not take climate policy seriously.Across government, words have not been followed by action. Consider the issue of heat pumps. Up to 600,000 per year would be installed by 2028, the nation was promised. In this way, we would phase out gas-burning, carbon-emitting central heating systems from millions of households. However, a House of Lords committee revealed last month that there was now no chance of meeting that target. A mere 50,000 heat pumps were installed last year \u2013 and this was at a time when the phasing out of gas central heating would have helped cut sky-high energy bills and increase the UK\u2019s energy security.The consequences of this failure to act will be harmful not just to our climate control efforts but to our international reputation as leaders in the battle against global heating, said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change.\u201cFew countries will listen to our arguments for stronger action when we are failing to deliver on our domestic target,\u201d he told the Observer. \u201cThis is also damaging the UK economy. The CBI has already warned that Britain is missing out on billions of pounds in major export opportunities by failing to invest in new zero-carbon technologies, such as battery storage.\u201dUltimately the failure to deliver on net zero is the responsibility of successive prime ministers.During her leadership campaign Liz Truss said little about net zero, while appealing to anti-green Tory members by insisting that she didn\u2019t want to see farmers\u2019 fields \u201cfull of solar panels\u201d. Nor was delivery on net zero among Rishi Sunak\u2019s five priorities, which he listed at the start of the year. In fact, he has barely mentioned the issue since becoming leader.The government is now required by court to produce a more detailed net zero strategy this month. Time is fast running out for it.",

        "text": "Environmental campaigners have called on the government to learn from its own successes after official figures showed the use of single-use supermarket plastic bags had fallen 98% since retailers in England began charging for them in 2015.Annual distribution of plastic carrier bags by seven leading grocery chains plummeted from 7.6bn in 2014 to 133m last year, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said on Monday.Rebecca Pow, the minister for environmental quality and resilience, said the policy had \u201chelped to stop billions of single-use carrier bags littering our neighbourhoods or heading to landfill\u201d. The government claimed the average person in England now bought just two single-use carrier bags a year from major retailers.Campaigners welcomed the finding but said the statistic did not account for all types of plastic bag . They also questioned the timing of the announcement, made as experts said plans for 100 new North Sea oil and gas wells, announced the same day by the prime minister would \u201csend a wrecking ball through the UK\u2019s climate commitments\u201d.A 5p charge for carrier bags was introduced in English supermarkets in 2015. In 2021, the charge was increased to 10p and extended to all businesses. Since then, the number of plastic bags used across all retailers had fallen 35%, from 627m in 2019-20 to 406m in 2022-23, Defra said.Wales had introduced a 5p charge in 2011, Northern Ireland followed suit in 2013 and Scotland did so in 2014. Scotland and Northern Ireland have since raised their charges to 10p and 25p respectively.\u201cThis 98% reduction in single-use plastic bags shows inserting a plastic tax at the point of sale is a good policy for reducing consumer plastic bag use,\u201d said Steve Hynd of City to Sea, which campaigns for an end to the production of single-use plastics. But he said the data did not include sales of bags for life, nor did it break down the distribution between in-store shopping and home delivery.The charge is one of several measures introduced by the government to reduce the production of single-use plastics. In 2018 it banned microbeads in \u201crinse-off personal care products\u201d, in 2020 came restrictions on the supply of single-use plastic straws, drink stirrers and cotton buds, and in 2022 a tax was introduced on plastic packaging that was not at least 30% recycled. But campaigners said other promised measures had been delayed.Nina Schrank, the head of Greenpeace UK\u2019s plastic campaign, said: \u201cThe success of the plastic bag charge shows that when the government takes real action it gets results and the public gets on board. It\u2019s ironic then for these figures to come out just as ministers are busy delaying vital plans to tackle the scourge of single-use plastic.\u201cBoth the deposit return scheme and new rules to make plastic producers contribute to clean-up costs, which formed the key planks of the government\u2019s waste strategy, have been delayed until 2025. Instead of letting plastic polluters off the hook, ministers should bring in legally binding targets to force companies to turn off the plastic waste tap at the source.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

To be considered global leaders in tackling plastic pollution they need to be setting themselves reduction, refill and reuse targets and they also need to be implementing their own policies, such as an all-in deposit return scheme, like they promised in their 2015 manifesto, and the long-awaited extended producer responsibility policy.\u201cThere\u2019s obvious context here, which is that they reannounced the success of the single-use plastic bag ban on the same day that they unveiled a hugely destructive plans for 100 new oil and gas licences.\u201d",

They are also being asked to clean up waste and, where possible, stop dogs jumping in ponds.Attacks on livestock are a persistent problem in nature reserves, sometimes resulting in the death of cows, sheep and other animals that might be maintaining grassland ecosystems.While it\u2019s tempting in warm weather, dogs jumping in ponds disturb wildlife and their flea treatments can poison waterways. Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianPeople are also being reminded that dogs must be on leads no longer than 2 metres between 1 March and 31 July on open access land to protect ground-nesting birds, such as nightjars, willow warblers and meadow pipits. Oystercatchers, ringed plovers and little terns nest on beaches and are also easy to disturb. If a dog is seen worrying livestock, the landowner can legally kill the dog.Dozens of cases across the country of wildlife and livestock being damaged by dogs have been documented by the Wildlife Trusts. In Little Woolden Moss, Salford, dogs chase away curlews, lapwings and little ringed plovers, sometimes killing chicks in their nest. In Kent, there were at least eight dog attacks on Wildlife Trust staff and livestock, with 13 sheep killed. Dogs jumping in ponds can disturb wildlife, while their flea treatments pollute and poison ponds and other waterways.\u201cDogs are not the problem \u2013 it is the owners that are the problem,\u201d said Duncan Hutt, Northumberland Wildlife Trust\u2019s director of conservation, who has a cocker spaniel. \u201cWhether it is through lack of knowledge or lack of care, their dogs come first before anything else, including wildlife.\u201dA beach-nesting tern with its chick.

Photograph: Harry Collins/AlamyBecky Austin, nature reserves assistant at Yorkshire Wildlife Trust and a former dog owner, said there had been an increase in dog ownership since the pandemic and that while they wanted people to enjoy their reserves, their pets needed to be kept under control.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of activity happening away from paths. People don\u2019t have sight of their dogs, which causes problems for wildlife and other people who are visiting with children or those who might be nervous of dogs,\u201d she said.\u201cOwners often say \u2018they never catch or hurt anything\u2019 but the main issue is the stress of a predator moving through a landscape.

The marine pests, which they have renamed \u201cnaked clams\u201d, are nutritious, high in vitamin B12, and require only wood and water to grow.It\u2019s wonderful news. We desperately need sustainable sources of protein: meat is responsible for nearly 60% of greenhouse gases from food production, while industrial fish farming has huge environmental costs.For a number of years in the mid-2010s, my partner became obsessed with the idea that over the course of our lifetimes we would all end up eating insects. He had read an article about a London restaurant that served crickets, and sounded thrilled by the prospect, although for one reason or another we never made it there. This didn\u2019t stop him from expounding the benefits of tail-to-tentacle eating to anyone who would listen.This all changed when we went to Thailand earlier this year. We visited a night market that served a selection of local delicacies: fried grasshoppers, scorpions, stag beetles on sticks. To my horror, he returned from the stall with a paper tray filled with oily, glistening crickets. \u201cIt\u2019s the future of meat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s lean protein.\u201d The moment he crunched on the first one, his face froze. \u201cIt\u2019s very\u2026 insect-like. There\u2019s no meat on it. All you can taste is legs and wings.\u201d He struggled through a third of the portion before admitting defeat.Maybe naked clams are the future. Perhaps with the right recipe and flavour pairing they could become the next calamari rings. The pictures, unfortunately, are not appetising. There is a reason why most cultures have a taboo around eating insects, and why we pay despicable politicians millions of pounds to eat camel udders. We can intellectualise it all we want, but food also needs to be appealing. It will take some real ingenuity from chefs to make worms palatable to the public.

The debate is this: the forecast gale is coming from a different direction to normal and Dad says we need a second rope to secure the tree (it is already permanently tied to prevent it falling into stables). Meanwhile, my brother says that if it is likely to come down, it\u2019s better that it goes the other way.On a farm with public land, managing this kind of risk is part of the job, and trees near buildings, roads and paths must be checked carefully. We have just received a notice from the council that a large limb overhanging the road must be removed. It is being attacked by fungus.I\u2019m still chilled by a particular sports day at my child\u2019s primary school, when just an hour after the refreshments stand was tidied away, a huge potentially child-squashing branch fell to exactly where we\u2019d all been gathered. That tree was regularly inspected.This autumn, there has been a high risk of trees falling. The ground is saturated, making them easier to topple, and many deciduous trees are still in almost full leaf, so are more vulnerable to the force of the wind. It was these same conditions that made the October 1987 gales so devastating.A decision is made, and Dad descends the ladder. The oak is left with just one rope, to face whatever the storm brings. The gusts pick up and anything unfixed starts flying round the yard. Horses are unsettled, their raised heads appearing over stable doors.We sit out the weather. This time, wind speeds remain moderate, although the rain buckets down. The oak stands sturdy. A giant, curved specimen is lost in the woods, though. Later, I ride out, slopping through puddles and mud. The trunk blocks the way and is too big to jump on horseback. I wonder why that tree fell while others survived. Muntjac deer skitter from my path, and the great roots hang, exposed. It\u2019s not like the death of a pet, but it is nevertheless a moment of grief, a loss, a gap in the woods.Where possible, fallen trees are left to rot and provide vital deadwood habitat, but this one must be moved for access. It is perfect for carving into a bench, and soon the chainsaw will reverberate through the woods. Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",

Illustration: SunwizThe final quarter or 2023 also included Australia\u2019s two busier months for solar installations, with November clocking up 329MW and December 321MW. It also included the biggest single day when more than 26MW were added on 21 December.Warwick Johnston, SunWiz\u2019s managing director, said the industry was poised to \u201cstart off strongly in 2024\u201d as consumers raced to shield themselves from high electricity prices. In addition, a \u201cglobal oversupply has driven down the price or new panels\u201d, he said. \u2018Go hard and go big\u2019: How Australia got solar panels onto one in every three housesRead moreSmall-scale solar installations \u2013 covering systems or 100 kilowatts or narrower \u2013 have been the fastest-growing part of the renewable energy sector for some time. By contrast, large-scale solar and wind farms were not being built at the pace needed to replace ageing coal-fired power stations, the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) warned last month in a major report.More than 3m Australian homes had solar panels on their roofs, with annual growth of 12% over the last five years, Aemo said. That capacity meant rooftop solar was now capable of meeting almost half of underlying electricity demand across the national energy market in the middle of a sunny day.At the end of last year, rooftop solar was at times meeting all of South Australia\u2019s power demand and two-thirds of Victoria\u2019s, Aemo said.New operational demand records set in VIC (1,564 MW) & SA (-26 MW) on 31 December 2023, with #rooftopsolar contributing two-thirds of VIC's & all of SA's total energy needs. On the day, wholesale electricity prices averaged -$66.54 & -$73.02 ($/MWh) in SA & VIC, respectively. pic.twitter.com/0JUorY4wG4\u2014 AEMO (@AEMO_Energy) January 2, 2024Johnston said part of the increase in solar PV capacity was coming from households increasing the size of the units they bought. The average system reached almost 10.5kW, SunWiz\u2019s data showed.Average solar panel system capacity in kWs increased over the last year. Illustration: SunwizThe fall in cost of new panels, combined with increases in power prices of a quarter or more in the last year, meant the payback period for new systems had now dropped below five years for residential users. For commercial users, panels will pay off their costs in about 5.3 years as of the end or 2023, SunWiz said.The average time taken to pay off the cost of installation of a solar system has dropped to just under 5 years for residential owners. Illustration: SunwizWhile final figures are still to be tallied, households probably added about 60,000 home batteries in 2023, or a fifth more than in the previous year, Johnston said.Consumers were looking to soak up the excess solar energy their rooftop systems were generating during the middle of the day, he said, noting that states such as Victoria were paying just three cents per kilowatt-hour fed back into the grid.",

        "text": "The Lion King was my first, brief encounter with grief. When watching the original 1994 movie, I bolted from the theater the moment the benevolent lion king Mufasa died, not yet able to stomach the idea of a life so abruptly lost. It was only recently that I returned to a theater to see the second half of the movie, this time the 2019 reboot. This time I was surprised to be overcome by a different form of grief.Over the course of the nearly two-hour, photorealistic movie, I felt a creeping sadness as the lush, biodiverse African savanna \u2013 a mixed grassland-woodland ecosystem \u2013 turned to desert. All signs of green vanish. Antelope bones litter the dry land. The lions cower in fear while looking onto the remains of their homeland \u2013 the dusty, dried-up earth and the craggy, leafless trees. Eventually, at the height of destruction, fire engulfs everything.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the home I remember,\u201d Nala says. The lions are experiencing \u201csolastalgia\u201d, a term for the specific kind of grief that comes from witnessing the loss of your home environment, often in relation to climate change.While the ecological destruction of the Pride Lands was present in the 1994 version of the movie, it takes on a more visceral quality in the 2019 version. This is in part due to the unnervingly realistic 3D animation, intended to capture the \u201cspectacle of a BBC wildlife documentary\u201d. But it is also because this kind of loss is all too familiar to an audience witnessing the earth hurtle towards a climate breakdown.The Lion King review \u2013 resplendent but pointlessRead moreYet the climate crisis goes unacknowledged in the reboot. As Disney\u2019s highest-grossing animated movie of all time, it could have been a real opportunity to talk about the tragic experience the audience shares with the lions: the unprecedented, rapid destruction of earth. In this sense, the movie remained overly faithful to the original script.I\u2019m not asking for a radical rewrite \u2013 just for say, Zazu, the chatty, perennially anxious red-billed hornbill, to have nodded to climate change just once. For example, when Zazu announced, \u201cThe Pride Lands are in imminent danger,\u201d he could have added why.Such a small acknowledgment would have given The Lion King \u2013 a story of ecological loss due to the abuse of power \u2013 more space to resonate with our current moment.To the movie\u2019s credit, the destruction of the Pride Lands is not a natural process, but is rooted in a pattern of overconsumption and the unequal distribution of resources. This pattern is set in motion by Scar, the evil, authoritarian lion king, who rules according to a vow made to the hyenas: \u201cEverything the light touches is yours for the kill.\u201d It\u2019s a drastically different vision from that of the previous lion king, Mufasa, who believed that \u201ceverything the light touches is yours to protect\u201d.It is Scar\u2019s vision of the earth \u2013 as something to consume rather than protect \u2013 that turns the Pride Lands to desert.The Lion King is an opportunity to ask ourselves how we can all better protect everything the light touches. It\u2019s an opportunity to acknowledge the ways that reckless capitalism and climate change are fundamentally entwined. It\u2019s an opportunity to think more closely about our land use and consumption patterns \u2013 major drivers of climate change, as a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report lays out.The Lion King also stands to be a lesson in retaining hope, even when everything appears on the path of irreversible doom. When Simba bemoans his inability to change the past, Timon, the optimistic meerkat, chimes in, \u201cBut you know what you can change? The future.\u201dIt\u2019s this hopeful line of questioning \u2013 of exactly how to change the future, of how to restore the viability of the earth \u2013 that couldn\u2019t be more important for everyone today to ask. Yet the new movie falls short of even approaching an answer.

        "text": "The three rivers designated for swimming in England have all been given \u201cpoor\u201d status in newly published government water quality figures.Data released by the Environment Agency on Friday showed that during the 2023 bathing season 96% of bathing waters in England met minimum standards, with 90% of bathing waters in England being rated as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d. This was a decline from the previous year\u2019s statistics that showed that 97% met the minimum standard of \u201csufficient\u201d, while 93% met the highest standards of good and excellent.The vast majority of designated bathing sites are coastal, and only three rivers in England have the special designation for swimming: the River Wharfe at Ilkley, Wolvercote Mill Stream in Oxfordshire and the Deben estuary at Waldringfield. All three have been given poor status, meaning people should not swim in them and risk getting sick if they do. Sewage spills and agricultural runoff mean that swimming sites can carry E coli and intestinal enterococci, which would make swimmers ill.Many European countries designate a far greater number rivers as swimming areas. In France, for example, there are more than 570 river bathing sites.The chief executive of the campaign group River Action, James Wallace, said: \u201cOnly three rivers have designated bathing water status and they are all rated poor, the worst rating possible. Sadly, that tells its own story, that the UK\u2019s rivers are in a very fragile state. Today, only 14% of the UK\u2019s rivers are considered healthy. Many others like the iconic River Wye are so polluted they are at risk of ecocide.\u201dEngland to diverge from EU water monitoring standardsRead moreThe data is focused solely on the 400 sites designated for swimming during the spring and summer months, from 15 May to 30 September. These are usually the driest times of year, when sewage is least likely to be spilled, as overflows are supposed to happen only during heavy rain when sewers are overwhelmed. However, analysis has found that water companies sometimes dump sewage during dry weather when they are not legally supposed to.A recent report by Surfers Against Sewage found that most popular bathing sites had unsafe levels of sewage, and the Liberal Democrats revealed this summer that human waste was dumped near many of Britain\u2019s best beaches. There are fears that the situation could deteriorate further because the government plans to diverge from EU water quality standards.At this rate, the government will not meet its water quality standards, with all UK water bodies supposed to be rated at least good by 2027. The Labour party has promised to fix the issue by imposing stricter rules on water companies, including banning bonuses for those that continue to pollute and ensuring water bosses face personal criminal liability for sewage dumping.The shadow environment secretary, Steve Reed, said: \u201cThe water industry is broken after 13 years of Tory government \u2013 with stinking, toxic sewage lapping up on our rivers, lakes, and seas. It is disgusting that families and children cannot enjoy these waters without the threat of getting sick. Despite this gross negligence, consumers are now expected to pay higher water bills, whilst CEOs are pocketing millions in bonuses.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We have also set stringent targets for water companies to reduce sewage spills from storm overflows which frontloads action at designated bathing waters to make the biggest difference to these sites as quickly as possible.\u201d",

        "text": "Prince William plans to double the size of a tiny fragment of rainforest on his Dartmoor estate, the Duchy of Cornwall has announced.Wistman\u2019s Wood is one of Britain\u2019s remaining ancient \u201ctemperate rainforests\u201d, brought into the public eye after environmental campaigner Guy Shrubsole\u2019s bestselling book on the subject.Described as \u201chaunting\u201d, and \u201cmagical\u201d by visitors, the Devon woodland is just 3 hectares (7.4 acres) , and walkers are periodically banned over fears of damaging the delicate ecosystem. Overgrazing of sheep and cattle in the area has also been an issue.It is often referred to as one of the south-west\u2019s last remaining examples of temperate rainforest, and came within Prince William\u2019s purview after he inherited the duchy, a large landholding including the greatest privately owned area of Dartmoor national park, from his father, King Charles, when he succeeded to the throne.Wistman\u2019s Wood contains very rare Atlantic mosses and lichens. Photograph: Ian G Dagnall/AlamyThe duchy has been criticised for failing to protect the sites of special scientific interest on its Dartmoor estate.Wistman\u2019s Wood contains very rare Atlantic mosses and lichens, but is a small and isolated remnant, making it vulnerable to risks such as fire, disease and climate change, and increasing the need to carefully improve its resilience.But the duchy said on Monday it aimed to regenerate and at least double the size of Wistman\u2019s Wood by 2040, including expanding wood-pasture habitat.The royal estate has been working with Natural England to restore the woodland and will allow it to regenerate naturally by reducing cattle grazing \u2013 using a virtual electric fence to protect sensitive areas, and improving footpaths so the public do not stray into the regenerating woodland. The Duchy will also plant some new trees by seed collected from the ancient wood.Wistman\u2019s Wood is often referred to as one of the south-west\u2019s last remaining examples of temperate rainforest. Photograph: David Clapp/Getty ImagesTony Juniper, the chair of Natural England, said: \u201cWistman\u2019s Wood national nature reserve is a magical fragment of ancient temperate rainforest. This exciting plan to allow the wood to expand through regeneration will give it long-term resilience and provide a wealth of benefits for people and nature. Reserves like this one will act as the battery packs powering nature recovery across the country\u201cSuccess in restoring nature at scale can only really happen through partnerships and we are delighted to be working with the Duchy of Cornwall and its tenants in developing what is a fine example of farming and nature recovery going forward together hand in hand. The enhancement of this spectacular landscape and its habitats will enable people to connect with a site rich in wildlife and historic interest for long into the future.\u201dCampaigners have long been calling for the duchy to take better care of the ancient woodland on its estate, and they were pleased to hear this now appears to be happening. One group, Wild Card, delivered a 70,000 signature petition to Prince William asking him to expand temperate rainforest.Shrubsole, author of The Lost Rainforests of Britain, said: \u201cThis is fantastic news \u2013 temperate rainforest used to cover 20% of Britain, including large swathes of Dartmoor, but centuries of deforestation means it now covers less than 1% of the country.\u201cThe duchy\u2019s plan to double the size of Wistman\u2019s Wood through natural regeneration is an awe-inspiring example of farmers, landowners and ecologists working together in partnership \u2013 and is vital to make this tiny fragment of temperate rainforest more resilient to the impacts of the climate crisis.\u201cI hope this announcement inspires other farmers and landowners across the west of Britain to follow suit and restore temperate rainforest on their land. There is now huge momentum to bring back Britain\u2019s lost rainforests, and not a moment too soon.\u201d",

The analysis of climate data released by WaterAid and Cardiff and Bristol universities finds that under extreme climate pressures, areas that used to experience frequent droughts are now more prone to frequent flooding, while other regions historically prone to flooding now endure more frequent droughts.The southern Shabelle region of Ethiopia, which between 1980 and 2000 experienced numerous periods of flooding, is exhibiting a shift towards prolonged and severe drought, the analysis, published on Tuesday, shows. The Shabelle River, which is a major water source for Somalia, recently experienced the worst of the drought conditions in the Horn of Africa. The increased droughts are mirrored in northern Italy, and the research shows the number of intense dry spells experienced by both areas has more than doubled since 2000.But as part of what researchers describe as a \u201cclimate hazard flip\u201d, the droughts in both regions are punctuated by extreme rainfall causing devastating flooding, which was experienced in the Lombardy region of Italy this summer.The research examined the frequency and magnitude of flooding and drought hazards over the past 41 years in locations across six countries: Pakistan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Mozambique. Italy was included as a European comparison.Children are moved across a flooded area in a satellite dish after heavy monsoon rainfalls in Jaffarabad district, Pakistan, in 2022. Photograph: Fida Hussain/AFP/Getty ImagesThe flip of climate extremes is being experienced by millions of people living in some of the poorest areas of the world, where communities are often ill-equipped to deal with them, researchers say.Tim Wainwright, the chief executive of WaterAid, said the climate crisis was a water crisis across the world. \u201cOur climate has become increasingly unpredictable with devastating consequences,\u201d he said.\u201cFrom drought-stricken farmlands to flood-ravaged settlements, communities in Pakistan, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Ethiopia are all experiencing alarming climate whiplash effects; Uganda is experiencing ever more catastrophic flooding and Mozambique a chaotic mix of both extremes.\u201dThe research was published on the eve of the UN\u2019s Cop28 climate conference where funds to help communities adapt and become more resilient to the extremes of climate change will be on the agenda once more.\u201cIt cannot be another summit where the climate adaptation can is kicked down the road,\u201d said Wainwright. \u201cOur leaders must recognise the urgency and prioritise investment into robust and resilient water systems now.\u201dWaterAid is calling on world leaders at Cop28 to prioritise clean water, decent sanitation and hygiene as key components of climate adaptation programmes as well as calling for rapidly scaled-up investment in water security in low- and middle-income countries.The communities experiencing the climate flip from extreme weather are some of the least able to cope with it. In 2022, the village of Bachal Bheel in the Badin region of south-east Pakistan was devastated by catastrophic flooding that engulfed two-thirds of the country.\u2018Drought is on the verge of becoming the next pandemic\u2019Read moreWaterAid spoke to people who had suffered in the flooding. Soni Bheel said when she was a child, local agriculture had prospered and villagers enjoyed robust health, but that her village was destroyed last year. Now 83, she said: \u201cOur village was washed away in the flood, but it taught us a vital lesson: we must build our houses on higher ground to protect them from future floods. We\u2019re now elevating our homes with a 2-ft-high platform.\u201dThe data shows Mbale, an eastern region of Uganda in the shadow of Mount Elgon, is experiencing much wetter conditions, which has created unprecedented flooding over the past three years. WaterAid spoke to Okecho Opondo, a retired primary school teacher, who said the change in weather patterns was causing huge problems.\u201cWe are in total confusion. The months that used to be rainy are now dry. When the rains come, they can be short yet heavy, leading to floods,\u201d she said. \u201cOn other occasions the rainy periods are too long, leading to destruction of infrastructure and crop failure. And then the dry periods can be very long, further leading to crop failure and hunger.\u201dKaterina Michaelides, the professor of dryland hydrology at the University of Bristol Cabot Institute for the Environment and joint lead author of the research, said climate breakdown was not leading to monolithic change. \u201cInstead, the hazard profile for any region is likely to change in unpredictable ways. These factors must be considered to support climate adaptation for the lives and livelihoods of humans across the globe.\u201d",

It blows and blows until the season knows it is time to sit on its suitcase, overstuffed with things that happened, zip it up and travel to the other side of the world. Sometimes, the season gets trapped for a week, like a little whirlwind of leaves, or one leaf on a small plant going round and round: an incantation. You get one last period of very cold or very hot. You are trapped, too, like a sheep in its wool: you are in the present, there is no going forward until the season is on its way.In Things I Don\u2019t Want to Know, Deborah Levy is carrying her luggage up a steep path on a mountain in Spain. \u201cThe smell of wood fired in the stone houses below and the bells on sheep grazing in the mountains and the strange silence that happens in between the bells chiming suddenly made me want to smoke.\u201dConservation efforts celebrated as 26 Australian species no longer need threatened listingRead moreIt is spring.

But today\u2019s children are not the first generation to have a sharp awakening to our violation of the environment \u2013 pollution was a major concern for youngsters of the 1970s.As a child, my cultural heroes were environmentalists.

Today\u2019s stressed youngsters might well enjoy the benefits of a less commercial society. After the anger, there may be space for a better way of life.Clare HobbaSt Albans Commentary on the Met Gala (Fab-u-lous! The campest Met Gala ever, G2, 8 May), fashion\u2019s most exclusive evening, touched upon all but one aspect of the event: environmental impact. The fashion industry is a major contributor to climate change; its carbon footprint exceeds that of international flights and maritime shipping combined. The UK government\u2019s recent report on fast fashion makes a fitting and appalling comparison to the carbon footprint of all EU member states (3.5bn tonnes). The dyeing, finishing and washing of clothes also generates excessive water waste.The crisis in materials as well as changing consumer sentiment makes me question the role of renowned events such as the Met Gala in curbing climate change. The pinnacle of slow fashion \u2013 wherein ideas typically take nine months to materialise into a single product \u2013 may seem an odd method for changing the throwaway culture of fast fashion. However, the Met Gala\u2019s role in fostering creativity to heights generally considered extravagant should be seen as the ideal platform for innovation. Competing ideas for how to green glamour at the level of high fashion, which can more readily assume risk, would pave the way for the gradual adoption of more sustainable methods by the wider fashion industry. The 2019 Met Gala carpet was pink.

It will probably be recycled, said Paul Peronard with the EPA.Alexis Bonogofsky, whose family\u2019s ranch was impacted by an oil spill on the Yellowstone River near Billings in 2011, took pictures Saturday of the refined petroleum product covering rocks and sandbars.

The US has used more than four times its fair share to become the richest country in the world, and would be responsible for $80tn in reparations under this scheme.\u201cIt is a matter of climate justice that if we are asking nations to rapidly decarbonise their economies, even though they hold no responsibility for the excess emissions that are destabilising the climate, then they should be compensated for this unfair burden,\u201d said Andrew Fanning, lead author and visiting research fellow at the University of Leeds\u2019s Sustainability Research Institute.In order to keep global heating to below 1.5C, the total global carbon budget starting from 1960 is 1.8tn tonnes of CO2 or equivalent greenhouse gases, according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) figures.Using population size, researchers calculated how much 168 countries have over- or under-used their fair share of the global carbon budget since 1960. Some countries were within their fair share allocation, while the global north (the US, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Israel) have already massively overshot their fair share of the atmospheric commons.Almost 90% of the excess emissions are down to the wealthy global north, while the remainder are from high-emitting countries in the global south, especially oil-rich states such as Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.Five low-emitting countries with large populations \u2013 India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria and China (currently the world\u2019s largest emitter) \u2013 would be entitled to receive $102tn, for sacrificing their fair share of the carbon budget in the zero emissions scenario.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They are the ones who must bear the costs of compensation.\u201dDemands are mounting to compensate climate-vulnerable countries for the threats they face due to the excessive greenhouse gas emissions of others, as part of a broader climate justice movement to make polluters pay for the climate crisis and green energy transition.Last year at the UN\u2019s Cop27 summit, states agreed to establish a \u201closs and damage\u201d financing fund to provide funds to poor countries for the irreparable and unavoidable economic and non-economic costs of extreme weather events and slow-onset climate disasters such as sea level rise and melting glaciers.According to research published last month, the world\u2019s top oil, gas and coal companies are responsible for $5.4tn (\u00a34.3tn) in drought, wildfires, sea level rise and melting glaciers among other climate catastrophes expected between 2025 and 2050. This was the first study quantifying the economic burden caused by individual companies that have extracted \u2013 and continue to extract \u2013 wealth from planet-heating fossil fuels.",

The report published by the Climate Change Committee also expressed the view that there was a lack of leadership on climate within government.Sunak stepped up his criticisms of green policies in the wake of the Tories\u2019 byelection victory in Uxbridge and Ruislip, with senior Conservative and Labour figures attributing the loss to the mayor of London Sadiq Khan\u2019s plan to expand the ultra-low emissions zone (Ulez) charge on high-polluting vehicles to the city\u2019s outer boroughs.In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph last week, the prime minister took aim at Labour\u2019s \u201canti-motorist\u201d positions. He attacked the opposition for criticising his fuel duty freeze, \u201cnot wanting to clamp down on eco zealots for disrupting traffic\u201d, and condemned the Welsh Labour government for blocking major road building projects.Despite her thinly disguised criticisms of Sunak\u2019s rhetoric, Coffey said the prime minister was committed to the environment and dealing with climate change.

Britain\u2019s leading garden charity said that although the gastropods were the garden visitor about which they received most complaints, they should be considered an important part of the garden ecosystem.The RHS has been following the method in its own gardens and recently found the nationally scarce wood cricket by the river at Wisley in Surrey. The silver-washed fritillary butterfly, which is of conservation concern, has been discovered on specific plants at Rosemoor in Devon.Golding is inspired by the ecologist Jennifer Owen who for 30 years studied what she found in her urban garden in Leicester, mapping 2,673 different species of flora and fauna, including 474 plants, 80 types of spider and 445 moths.\u201cDefinitely take pictures of new and unexpected plants \u2013 sometimes known as weeds \u2013 in your garden,\u201d Golding said. \u201cTake a picture and send it in so we can identify it. Once it\u2019s ID\u2019d you can find out a bit more about it because now you know what it is, and you can get a bit of understanding of what it is. Is it important, is it something a bit rarer? Are you really fortunate to have this plant in your garden?\u201dThe scientists are interested in all garden wildlife including animals: \u201cAnd even a bird for example, if you start to show a bit of interest, and you think, oh, maybe I\u2019ll just upload this to iNaturalist and I\u2019ll see what it is, you might start to find that you might have a bird that maybe wouldn\u2019t be expected to be there, or that you know was a bit rare and that\u2019s really interesting and really important data to have, because you can\u2019t just go walking through people\u2019s gardens when you do surveys.\u201dGolding said learning more about the ecology in your garden can help you naturally deal with a slug overload or other problems: \u201cI think sometimes if you have a lot of, for example, slugs and snails or whatever it might be, that you also have a bit of an ecosystem imbalance. So you might be able to do something in your garden.

In contrast, governments could easily compensate for the minimal impact on those on middle and lower levels of wealth.Chancel said: \u201cThese latter groups have nothing to fear from rapid action, in particular if governments decide to compensate for their losses, which can be done at relatively low cost.\u201dThe study found that in the US, two-thirds of the financial losses from lost fossil fuel assets would affect the top 10% of wealth holders, with half of that affecting the top 1%.Because the wealthiest people tend to have a \u201cdiverse portfolio of investments\u201d, it found, any losses would still make up less than 1% of this group\u2019s net wealth.Just 3.5% of financial losses from stranded assets would affect the poorest half of Americans and could easily be compensated for by government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The disease can lead to the gradual breakdown of tubular glands in the proventriculus. Losing these glands can cause the birds to become more vulnerable to infection and parasites and affect their ability to digest food and absorb some vitamins.Researchers called the fibrotic disease plasticosis to make it clear that it was caused by plastic in the environment.When birds ingest small pieces of plastic, they found, it inflames the digestive tract. Over time, the persistent inflammation causes tissues to become scarred and disfigured, affecting digestion, growth and survival.Natural materials found in the stomachs of birds, such as pumice stones, did not cause the same problems, leading scientists to label this a specifically plastic-caused disease.Bond, principal curator in charge of birds at the Natural History Museum, said: \u201cWhile these birds can look healthy on the outside, they\u2019re not doing well on the inside.

The ruling is a victory for community groups who have said for years that the bottled water firm has drained an important creek that serves as a habitat for wildlife and helps protect the area from wildfires.Arrowhead bottled water traces its roots to a hotel at the base of the San Bernardino Mountains that first opened in 1885 and began selling bottled spring water from its basement in 1906. But environmental and community groups say the company has never had permission to take water from the springs in the San Bernardino national forest.The state water resources control board agreed that BlueTriton does not have permission to use the water and ordered the company to stop.

Steve Stansfield, director of operations at the observatory, explains how to put on a metal ring, each with a unique number to help us to track and identify each individual. In autumn they will migrate to the South Atlantic, mostly off Brazil and Argentina, with the last juveniles leaving in late September or early October; they\u2019ll arrive back here in late March next year. A Manx shearwater that nested on the island in 2008 was shown by its ring to be over 50 years old, and would have flown around 5m miles in its lifetime.These ones are adults; at night-time they like to sit on and around the walls near to their burrows. During the day, when we ring the juveniles, we have to put our hands down the burrows and carefully take them out.As I carefully attach the ring with Steve\u2019s help, I think about all the phenomenal landscapes it has seen. Placing it back where it was found, I wish it good luck. Who knows \u2013 it might just make it to 50.

I duly trundled along and asked about the enormous dividend paid by the most polluting water company in England last year. Lo and behold, the main problems lie with Ofwat, which insists that it keeps prices low, and with shareholders, who demand an enormous payout.Then came what was, apparently, the clincher \u2013 \u201cWe have spent \u00a3XYZ million...\u201d \u2013 a tactic much loved by Conservative frontbenchers, ie provide a meaningless sum instead of telling us what proportion of the amount that should have been spent was achieved. I suppose I was meant to be grateful that United Utilities is going to open an information centre in Windermere to tell us what it is doing. That money would be better spent reducing pensioners\u2019 bills.The sad thing is that the public appears to bathe in apathy. Perhaps we should resurrect the spirit of the poll tax demonstrators and cancel our direct debits to the water companies.Gwyn JonesWindermere, Cumbria Your editorial (21 May) drew attention to the failings of privatised water companies and called for change, either by reforming the regulatory framework, or through renationalisation. The 1989 privatisation of the water industry in England and Wales was a response to the failure to invest in maintaining the nationalised industry\u2019s assets. The regulatory regime introduced at that time addressed these problems by creating an independent regulator, Ofwat.For perhaps the first 15 years, it could reasonably be claimed that privatisation had been successful. But more recently, yardstick competition between water companies, enabling Ofwat to set demanding targets based on best practice, has been weakened as ownership has passed increasingly to financial institutions more focused on returns than improving efficiency or service.Incentives for water firms to act responsibly have been weakened as responsibility for monitoring sewage discharges has passed from the Environment Agency (EA) to the firms themselves, while the EA\u2019s environmental protection budget fell by about two-thirds between 2010 and 2019.Reform should involve restoring the EA\u2019s responsibility and resources. Alternative ownership models should also be considered. Welsh Water is a debt-financed, not-for-profit business, whose average household bills fell in real terms between 2000 and 2020. Ian JonesFownhope, Herefordshire Re your article (30 water treatment works released 11bn litres of raw sewage in a year, study suggests, 27 May), sewage needs different treatment. Digesters produce methane, which can be used as a \u201cgreen\u201d fuel, as the methane and CO2 are produced anyway as sewage decomposes. The resulting volume of sewage is vastly reduced and is full of nutrients, which can be used as fertiliser. Care is needed as chemicals and heavy metals may have got into the sewage at source, but there are plants that sequester heavy metals.Obviously this needs major infrastructure, or green investment. The solutions will take a while to put in place, but what else are we going to do \u2013 keep swimming in shit?Dr Miles Clapham London  Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

Food wrappers and plastic bottles were also common. The plastic constitutes an \u201cemerging threat\u201d to reefs already stressed by the climate crisis and overfishing, the researchers said.The study, Plastic Pollution on the World\u2019s Coral Reefs, examined 85 reefs at more than two-dozen locations \u2013 including uninhabited atolls and reefs at depths of 150 metres \u2013 across the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic. It brought together scientists from the California Academy of Sciences; the foundation and charity Nekton; and the universities of S\u00e3o Paulo, Oxford and Exeter.The scientists used special diving equipment to survey in \u201cmesophotic\u201d, or twilight, zones at 30-150 metres (100-490ft) beneath the surface, and discovered the deeper sites had more plastic than the shallower ones.\u201cIt was surprising to find that debris increased with depth, since deeper reefs in general are farther from sources of plastic pollution,\u201d said Luiz Rocha, the co-director of the Hope for Reefs initiative at the California Academy of Sciences.Almost three-quarters of larger items found were from ghost fishing gear, with plastic wrappers and bottles also common. Photograph: Luiz Rocha/California Academy of Sciences\u201cWe are almost always the first humans to set eyes on these deeper reefs, and yet we see human-produced trash on every dive.\u201dThere was more plastic pollution in reefs nearer to densely populated cities and markets, as well as marine protected areas, whose borders are heavily frequented by fishers.The researchers noted that plastic can spread coral disease, and that fishing lines and nets can damage the structure of the reefs and thus harm fish abundance and diversity.\u201cOur findings reveal some of the complex collective challenges we face when dealing with plastic pollution,\u201d said Hudson Pinheiro, the lead author, from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and a research fellow at the academy. \u201cAs marine resources around the world dwindle, humans that rely on those resources are turning to deeper habitats and those closer to marine protected areas where fish remain abundant.\u201dComoros, an island chain off the south-east coast of Africa, was the worst-affected location, with nearly 84,500 items of plastic in each square kilometre.The least polluted was the Marshall Islands, with about 580 pieces a square kilometre.Scientists discover pristine deep-sea Gal\u00e1pagos reef \u2018teeming with life\u2019Read moreOne potential reason for finding more plastic at greater depths could be increased wave action and turbulence at the surface, which could drag debris deeper. Other possibilities include recreational divers removing trash from shallower reefs, and shallow corals \u2013 which have higher growth rates \u2013 growing over the debris.The researcher stressed their findings highlights the need to expand the depth of marine protected areas to include mesophotic reefs, update international agreements on combating plastic pollution at source \u2013 such as those discussed at the recent Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution \u2013 to include fishing gear, and to develop low-cost, low-impact biodegradable alternatives.",

        "text": "Mont Blanc, the tallest mountain in the Alps, has shrunk by 2.2 metres since 2021 to its lowest height in recent memory.The mountain, which is capped by a ridge of ice covering the rock, was measured by a team of surveyors from the Haute-Savoie regional administration, aided by a drone.The results, published on Thursday, suggest the new official height of Mont Blanc is 4,805.59 metres. The previous reading, taken two years ago, recorded the summit at 4,807.81 metres, which was in turn almost a metre less than the measurement taken in 2017.Describing 2023 as a \u201csomewhat exceptional year\u201d, one of the surveyors involved, Denis Borel, told the French televisions channel TF1 that the mountain had lost \u201c3,500 cubic metres of ice and snow compared to the volume measured in 2021, representing roughly the volume of an Olympic swimming pool\u201d. Borel said the loss was \u201cquite considerable compared to the measurements of previous eras\u201d.Climate and glaciology experts cautioned against linking the shrinking of Mont Blanc\u2019s summit to the loss of glacial ice cover in the Alps.\u201cEven if we see that there is a slight downward trend \u2013 around 15 to 20cm since 2001 \u2013 of this snowy summit of Mont Blanc, climatologists and glaciologists tell us that it takes approximately 50 years of measurement to be able to draw conclusions on possible global warming at this altitude of 4,800 metres,\u201d said Borrel. Ice cover at the summit of Europe tended to experience variation, depending on wind and precipitation, he said.\u201cThis is not representative of global climate warming, because the climatic conditions at the summit of Mont Blanc are rather polar,\u201d said Luc Moreau, a glaciologist from Chamonix.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The wind will remove the snow or not,\u201d he said, adding that the summit dome of Mont Blanc is more like a \u201cdune complex\u201d with strong winter winds stripping snow from the summit.The 2.22-metre decline could be down to lower precipitation during summer, said Jean des Garets, chief geometer in the Haute-Savoie department of south-eastern France. \u201cMont Blanc could well be much taller in two years,\u201d when it is next measured, he added.The mountain\u2019s rocky peak measures 4,792 metres above sea level, but its thick covering of ice and snow varies in height from year to year depending on wind and weather.Researchers have been measuring it every two years since 2001, hoping to garner information about the impact of climate change on the Alps.\u201cWe\u2019re gathering the data for future generations, we\u2019re not here to interpret them, we leave that up to the scientists,\u201d des Garets said.\u201cAfter these measurement campaigns, we have already learned a lot: we know that the summit is in perpetual movement both in altitude with variations of almost 5 metres, and in position.\u201dThe impact of global warming has been well documented in the Alps. Its glaciers have lost a third of their volume in recent years and the mountain range has also lost permafrost \u2013 soil and rocky material that stays frozen continuously for at least two years and acts as a glue for major mountain features \u2013 above an approximate height of 2,200m.",

        "text": "When it comes to keeping off extra pounds, watching what we eat may not be enough \u2013 we have to keep an eye on our food\u2019s packaging, too.Rates of obesity among US adults have increased from 14% in 1980 to 42% today, and half the world is expected to be overweight or obese by 2035, with children and teens facing the sharpest increase in obesity and its consequences. Because data doesn\u2019t support the idea that overeating and lack of exercise are squarely to blame, the scientific community is exploring other factors that may contribute \u2013 including metabolic disruption caused by eating products packaged in plastic.The Guardian view on obesity: prevention is as important as cure | EditorialRead moreFor a study published last year, researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology set out to determine what chemical compounds exist in 34 common plastic items that touch things we eat, such as yogurt cups, juice bottles, styrofoam meat trays, gummy-candy packages, and plastic wrap used for produce and cheese, as well as items often found in kitchens, like polyurethane placemats and sponges.Of the 55,000 chemicals the researchers found in these items, only 629 were identifiable, with 11 being known metabolic disruptors such as phthalates and bisphenols, which interfere with our bodies\u2019 ability to regulate weight, among other troubling health effects. However, when exposed to in vitro human cell cultures (studies have not used human or animal test subjects), far more chemicals than the identified 11 metabolic disruptors triggered adipogenesis \u2013 the process underlying obesity, in which cells proliferate and accumulate an excess of fat.\u201c[W]e\u2019re quite certain [that] there are many chemicals in plastic products that disrupt metabolism, but we just couldn\u2019t identify all of them,\u201d Martin Wagner, a study co-author said. Strikingly, Wagner and his colleagues found that a third of all the common products they tested contain chemicals that trigger the adipogenic process. Although we are exposed to them daily, most of these mystery chemicals are unknown, unstudied and unregulated.Plastics are made when chemical compounds from refined fossil fuels are mixed with various other, often toxic, chemicals to promote desired characteristics like flexibility and water resistance. We now understand that chemicals don\u2019t just stay put in the material but can leach from packaging into our food. This March, scientists at McGill University proved that the carcinogenic and obesogenic bisphenol BPS, found in food labels such as produce stickers, can \u201cmigrate through packaging materials into the food people eat\u201d, St\u00e9phane Bayen, an associate professor of food science and agricultural chemistry, said in a release. For years, experts have been cautioning against plastic food containers, particularly for hot or oily foods which can render the plastics unstable and increase the risk of chemical leaching.The scientists I speak to frequently argue that we need to start reducing our exposure to plastic without waiting for more slow-moving research to unequivocally prove that the plastics in our food, products, blood and organs are risk factors for bad health outcomes. Wagner is no exception. While he cannot make a causal link between metabolism-disrupting chemicals in plastic and the obesity epidemic, \u201cHow much evidence do we need before we do something right?\u201d Wagner asks.There is potentially positive news from the Norwegian study: while some plastic products carried chemicals that made fat cells proliferate, other similar products did not. For instance, PET, the transparent plastic used mainly for water bottles, doesn\u2019t contain metabolism-disrupting chemicals and is in fact relatively chemically simple. Some polystyrene styrofoam fruit trays had an obesogenic effect on cell cultures, but others didn\u2019t.That means some plastic producers, whether intentionally or not, are making less harmful forms of plastic. If industry manufacturers were transparent about the entire suite of chemicals present in their products, consumers could choose plastics with safer formulations and better overall industry safety standards could be developed.Really, reducing our plastic exposure should be our overall goal; the FDA\u2019s approach to regulating chemicals used in food packaging has been described by experts as \u201cwoefully outdated\u201d, and there\u2019s a chance that even plastic producers are not sure what chemicals end up in the products they make. But it\u2019s clear that these plastics and the chemicals associated with them are making their way into our bodies \u2013 by transference from packaging, but also in the form of microplastics, with humans eating an estimated 44lbs of plastic in our lifetimes.When we think about cutting junk out of our diets, the culprits shouldn\u2019t just be candy and soda \u2013 plastic needs to go, too.\nAdrienne Matei is a freelance journalist\n",

It has killed birch trees and emptied ponds, depriving wildlife of habitat.Hayden has been approached to sell his land but the 65-year-old refused, the emotional investment in the land his father farmed well into his 80s being too high.The developer, L&Q, which worked with Homes England\u2019s predecessor on the first phase of the development, had to lower the water levels in order to build on the land, a process known as dewatering. However, L&Q denies any of the work could have led to long-term issues with groundwater levels.Hayden has reduced the amount of flowers he grows each year and is troubled by the impact later phases of development are likely to have on the groundwater in his property, which he says he has a legally protected right to access.\u201cWe used to grow pot plants in the greenhouse twice a year, tens of thousands of them, we had the irrigation to do that,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cBut now with the flow of the water coming across my property being taken away due to what they did on phase one, I\u2019ve got no water. We\u2019re trying to grow fruit and vegetables instead.\u201dNew homes being built in Northstowe, south Cambridgeshire. Photograph: Julian Eales/AlamyHayden claims a future phase of the development \u2013 will lower the water level \u201cupwater\u201d of his farm by up to 2 metres. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get a hell of a lot worse,\u201d he said.Hayden said the less profitable fruit and vegetables they grow \u2013 raspberries, gooseberries, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers \u2013 would provide a local, sustainable source of food for the future residents of the new town but this is in jeopardy.An independent report, commissioned by South Cambridgeshire district council, concluded last year that construction work was to blame for emptying ponds in Longstanton of their water, which campaigners said had a knock-on effect on wildlife.The same campaigners have been granted a judicial review of the development of 4,000 homes in a forthcoming phase of the new town\u2019s development.But as the water levels remain at record low levels, Hayden and the campaigners in Longstanton are desperate, claiming Homes England, the Environment Agency, South Cambs district council and private developers are ignoring their pleas for help.Daniel Fulton, 41, an environmental campaigner and resident of Longstanton, said: \u201cFirst, all the ponds in the village were drying up. We started fighting on that. People in the village are really angry. None of our elected office holders are responding, they are hiding.\u201dConstruction work at Northstowe, north-west of Cambridge. Photograph: Julian Eales/Alamy\u201cWe started noticing issues as far back as 2015,\u201d Fulton said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had three different MPs, all of whom have come to visit the ponds. None of them have done anything.\u201dAs a resident of the village, Fulton said he has been left feeling angry. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on is so obviously wrong and none of our elected office holders are doing anything about it. It\u2019s infuriating.\u201dFighting legal battles through his campaign vehicle, Fews Lane Consortium, had been stressful, he added. Fulton said the village wanted a long-term, environmental solution.A spokesperson for Homes England said it was not responsible for the first phase of Northstowe, adding there was no abstraction of groundwater for phase two. They said the impact on water for phase 3A was considered by consultants and \u201cthe development is not anticipated to change groundwater levels in the surrounding area\u201d, adding: \u201cHowever, Homes England is committed to monitoring groundwater levels going forward as a precautionary measure.\u201dTumi Hawkins, South Cambridgeshire district council\u2019s lead cabinet member for planning, said she recognised \u201cthe local concern about groundwater\u201d, adding the council was working with \u201ckey organisations to understand the causes and next steps\u201d.A spokesperson for L&Q Estates said the draining of water in phase one was \u201cstandard practice and an approved construction method\u201d, adding: \u201cWe believe it is highly unlikely that the temporary work carried out over five years ago would have a long-term impact on water levels.\u201dAn Environment Agency spokesperson said: \u201cWe are currently looking into reports of illegal abstraction on the development in question in Northstowe, Cambridge.\u201d",

        "text": "At least 1,000 birds died from colliding into a single building in Chicago on Thursday, 5 October, as they migrated south to their wintering grounds. Volunteers are still recovering bird carcasses within 1.5 miles of McCormick Place, the largest convention center in North America, which is largely covered with glass.New York\u2019s plan to save birds from crashing into buildings: lights outRead more\u201cIt\u2019s the tip of an iceberg but it\u2019s it\u2019s a huge, huge amount of birds we found both dead and injured,\u201d said Annette Prince, director of Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, adding that this was the highest number of bird strikes that the group recorded from the grounds of one building in a single day.From late Wednesday, 4 October, through early Thursday, 5 October, a peak estimate of 1.5 million birds were in the air over Cook county, home to the Chicago metropolitan area. Carcasses of Tennessee warblers, hermit thrush, American woodcocks and other varieties of songbirds were recovered.\u201cNot every bird that hits the window is going to leave behind a body,\u201d said Brendon Samuels, who researches bird window collisions at the University of Western Ontario.He noted that the true extent of affected birds will unravel over a couple of days as people continue to pick up birds around downtown Chicago.\u201cIn fact, we often see birds collide with glass and they continue flying some distance away, seriously injured in ways that ultimately they won\u2019t survive past a few hours,\u201d Samuels added.Birds dying in large numbers in a small geographic area tends to occur during peak migration periods in spring and fall. Weather conditions like opposing wind, rain and fog can make it difficult for birds to orientate themselves, in addition to light pollution from cities that can draw them in and trap them among deadly structures.\u201cAnywhere you\u2019ve got glass, you\u2019re going to have birds hitting the windows,\u201d said Bryan Lenz at the American Bird Conservancy. Annually, up to a billion birds die due to collisions, and in the case of Chicago, the dead and injured birds were most likely flying from Canada en route to South and Central America.Everywhere birds visit, they perform essential ecosystem services that have economic value and are necessary for the functioning of ecosystems. Following major wildfires like those in Canada, birds that return to burned areas can disperse seeds and aid forest landscape regeneration. Global increases in temperatures can contribute to the increase in pest insect populations, and birds that feed on them can help curb the issues that pose a threat for humans and food systems.Of all cities in the US, Chicago\u2019s light pollution poses the greatest risk for migrating birds. Turning off building lights is one way to reduce fatalities. A 2021 study done in McCormick Place, the same site of Thursday\u2019s bird deaths, found that shutting off half the lights in large buildings can reduce collisions by six to 11 times. McCormick Place is a participant of the Lights Out Chicago program, which has buildings voluntarily switch off or dim lights at night unless someone is inside.\u201cIt is important to understand that there is an event going on at Lakeside Center [part of McCormick Place] this week, so, therefore, the lights have been on when occupied. Once the space is unoccupied, the lights have been turned off,\u201d said a representative from McCormick Place.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2021, the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, signed the Bird Safe Buildings Act, which \u201crequires bird-friendly design to be incorporated into the construction and renovation of state-owned buildings\u201d in the state, per Audubon.org.\u201cWe have a lot of existing buildings that are killing birds, not just new construction,\u201d said Samuels, adding that investments in retrofits, creating tax credits for such environmental initiatives and making windows more bird-friendly can be an economical way to solve this. \u201cWe already have solutions, we just need to put those into policy.\u201d",

It is seen as leading a new form of more radical climate action in Europe with high-profile direct action often aimed at big business interests, state projects and large-scale farming.The group was part of a demonstration over a controversial irrigation project in Sainte-Soline, western France, in March that led to fierce clashes with police. Around 5,000 protesters battled with more than 3,000 police officers. Two protesters were left in a coma afterwards, while around 30 officers were injured.The demonstrators were protesting against a giant reservoir for storing water pumped up from the underground water table, saying it would hurt smaller farmers and the ecosystem, while benefiting mainly industrial agriculture groups.France\u2019s Human Rights League said after the protests that \u201cas soon as the demonstrators arrived at the reservoir site, police fired at them with weapons of war: teargas grenades, stun grenades, explosive sting-ball grenades and rubber bullets \u2026 the deployment put everyone present at risk of serious harm\u201d.Earlier this month, UN experts urged France to review its policing practices, expressing concern at the \u201creported excessive use of force\u201d against protesters, in particular at Sainte-Soline.This month Les Soul\u00e8vements de la Terre led protests against a sand quarry in western France where protesters tore up fields and equipment at a farm. The group was also one of several organisers of a banned demonstration at the weekend against a new rail link between the eastern city of Lyon and Turin in Italy.On Tuesday, prosecutors said they detained 14 people for questioning over vandalism at an earlier protest supported by Les Soul\u00e8vements de la Terre, against a Lafarge cement plant near the southern city of Marseille.The interior minister, G\u00e9rald Darmanin, confirmed in parliament on Tuesday that the group would be shut down, saying \u201cno cause justifies the injuring of police officers and gendarmes\u201d.The government spokesman, Olivier V\u00e9ran, accused the coalition of encouraging violence at the Sainte-Soline irrigation protest in March. \u201cYou don\u2019t dissolve an association because of its ideas,\u201d V\u00e9ran told CNews television. \u201cYou dissolve it because there is violence or a risk for public safety.\u201dV\u00e9ran said the group \u201cwhipped up violence at Sainte-Soline by inviting rioters, who came from across Europe with metal bars and p\u00e9tanque balls to try to kill police officers\u201d.He said: \u201cThe climate question does not justify throwing rocks at police in a field.\u201dThe dissolution of Les Soul\u00e8vements de la Terre was officially launched by the interior ministry just after the Sainte-Soline clashes in March, using powers that have been previously used to outlaw far-right and Islamist groups.The group said in a statement on Tuesday that the agricultural and food industry as well as the farmers\u2019 union had leant directly on the government to issue a ban. In a statement, the group said: \u201cTrying to silence the Soul\u00e8vements de la Terre is a vain attempt to break the thermometer instead of worrying about the temperature.\u201dThe decree to ban the group will be presented at the government\u2019s weekly cabinet meeting on Wednesday.AFP contributed to this report",

Why one country is trying to limit its number of livestockRead moreAbout 650m hectares (1,606m acres) was identified as plausible for seaweed farming, with the largest areas in Indonesia and Australia which both have large ocean regions under their economic control.\u201cCultivating seaweeds for food, feed and fuel within even a fraction of the 650m hectares of suitable ocean could have profound benefits to land use, emissions reduction, water and fertiliser use,\u201d the authors wrote.Scott Spillias, a researcher at the University of Queensland in Australia who led the study published in Nature Sustainability, said: \u201cPeople around the world are looking at the ocean as this big \u2018untapped\u2019 resource and asking if we should be using more of it.\u201dOne of the biggest benefits, the study said, would be the cultivation and use of red Asparagopsis as a cattle feed supplement that has been shown to result in drastically lower methane emissions from cows. One supplement based on the seaweed reportedly went on commercial sale to farmers in Australia last year.The study suggested cuts to methane emissions from using Asparagopsis could save 2.6bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent a year by 2050 \u2013 about the same as the current greenhouse gas footprint of India.Spillias said introducing more seaweed into human diets could also deliver benefits. In parts of Asia, seaweed makes up 2% of diets, but scaling this up to 10% globally could spare 110m hectares of land currently used for growing food.\u201cBasically this is just people eating more vegetables,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we grow seaweed, the best thing to do is for people to eat it rather than feed it to livestock, but that\u2019s going to need some big cultural shifts.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If this is done on a large scale we need to find better materials.\u201dHe said if there was a widescale push globally for seaweed farming, there could be social implications.\u201cMarine industries do not have a great reputation on human rights and if we\u2019re farming seaweed largely out of sight, then we need to think of the people in these industries and make sure they\u2019re being fairly treated,\u201d he said.",

It extends about 150 metres down and contains its own distinct mix of species.\u201cThe mesophotic zone is one of the least explored regions in coral reefs,\u201d says Yi-Kai Tea, postdoctoral fellow at the Australian Museum Research Institute in Sydney, by email from a research ship in the Indian Ocean. \u201cThis area is generally situated at an awkward depth \u2013 not deep enough to survey with submarines, too complex to trawl and dredge, and too deep to dive with traditional scuba techniques.\u201dQ&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world\u2019s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth \u2013 and how much there is to protect.\u00a0Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In order to photograph and collect specimens in the mesophotic zone, scientists use specialised diving gear that recirculates exhaled air rather than blowing bubbles straight into the water as regular scuba divers do. By carefully controlling the mix of gases, scrubbing out excess carbon dioxide and adding more oxygen as required, rebreather divers can extend their dives to 100 metres.They need to take down several big gas cylinders and spend hours ascending slowly to decompress safely from these great depths, but in this way they can encounter species previously unknown to science in this little-known region.Discovered in the deep: the \u2018forest of the weird\u2019 Read moreThe rose-veiled fairy wrasse was named in 2022: finifenmaa means rose in the local Dhivehi language \u2013 a double nod to the colourful fish and the Maldivian national flower, the pink rose, which goes by the same species name. One of the scientists involved in finding and naming the new wrasse is Ahmed Najeeb from the Maldives Marine Research Institute. This is the first time a Maldivian researcher has described a new species native to the region, Tea says.Like other species of wrasse, the rose-veiled fairy wrasse change their appearance and sex as they age. They start life as females and mature into males, becoming considerably more colourful. The males adorn themselves in stunning nuptial colours during the mating season, presumably to impress females.The finding was part of the California Academy of Sciences\u2019 Hope for Reefs initiative, which aims to better understand and protect the world\u2019s coral reefs, focusing on mesophotic reefs.In 2019, Tea named another fairy wrasse discovered in the mesophotic zone off the coast of Zanzibar, Tanzania. Vibranium fairy wrasse (Cirrhilabrus wakanda) have vivid purple scales and, as the females transition to males their heads turn sunshine yellow.The Vibranium fairy wrasse was discovered in 2019. Photograph: Luiz Rocha, California Academy of SciencesThe name pays homage to the comic superhero Black Panther and his homeland Wakanda. \u201cLike the elusive fictional nation of Wakanda \u2026 the wrasse has eluded science due to it living in obscure remote reefs deep beneath the surface,\u201d says Tea. Vibranium is a fictional rare metal woven into Black Panther\u2019s suit. \u201cThe colours and patterns also reminded us of the garments used by the Wakandans in the movie,\u201d he says. In the Maldives, the beautiful colours of the rose-veiled fairy wrasse have proved irresistible and they are already being collected from the wild for the ornamental aquarium trade, although currently they remain abundant. \u201cAs far as we know, they are not under any immediate risk,\u201d says Tea.",

Better insulated homes could help save the NHS about \u00a32bn by preventing millions of people from developing respiratory conditions including asthma, it said.Using less energy could save an estimated \u00a34bn worth of investment in infrastructure such as new electricity networks and substations needed to meet the UK\u2019s growing demand for electricity. It would also reduce emissions from power plants by 5%, thus cutting air pollution, and bring a \u00a32.7bn benefit to society, the report found.Dame Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cThe impact of raising minimum energy standards would be profound: giving a boost to household budgets, improving people\u2019s health, increasing energy security and helping the UK reach its net zero targets.\u201dThe government has been criticised for dragging its feet on enacting proposals that would force landlords to improve the energy efficiency of their properties to at least an EPC rating of C by 2028. Privately rented homes are only required to meet an E rating.Research by the Energy and Climate Intelligence unit thinktank has found that delaying the measures to 2030 could add \u00a31bn to the energy bills of 2.4m of the UK\u2019s leakiest homes.Moriarty said the Citizens Advice report showed insulating homes was \u201cabout so much more than reducing energy bills. It\u2019s a long-term solution that makes running the NHS cheaper and boosts quality of life in areas that need it most.\u201d\u201cThe government must make improving our draughty homes a top priority,\u201d she added.Ministers began a consultation on raising the minimum EPC requirement for privately rented homes in 2020 \u2013 but the government has so far not turned the proposals into legislation.Elmhurst Energy, which runs an EPC accreditation scheme, said landlords needed clarity on the government\u2019s plans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But his earnings and influence will be on the line when he appears before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on 28 October. His testimony could mark the beginning of the end of big oil escaping legal and financial responsibility for the climate crisis.Exxon helped cause the climate crisis. It\u2019s time they owned up | Mark HertsgaardRead moreJoining Woods, assuming that they all show up without being compelled by subpoenas, will be the heads of three other giant oil companies: Michael Wirth of Chevron, David Lawler of BP and Gretchen Watkins of Shell Oil. The Big Oil 4, let\u2019s call them, will be questioned about what members of Congress call a \u201clong-running, industry-wide campaign to spread disinformation about the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming\u201d.For the Big Oil 4 and their public relations advisers, the nightmare scenario is that 28 October will mirror the infamous congressional hearing that led to the downfall of big tobacco. On 14 April 1994, the top executives of the seven biggest tobacco companies in the US appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, chaired by Henry Waxman of California. Each executive solemnly testified that, no, they did not think that nicotine is addictive.CNN and C-Span carried the hearing live, and big tobacco became a national laughingstock \u2013 and legal target \u2013 overnight. A photo of the CEOs of Phillip Morris, R J Reynolds and their counterparts, right hands raised as they were sworn in, ran on the front page of the next day\u2019s New York Times, sparking further media coverage.Here\u2019s the part that today\u2019s big oil chieftains particularly don\u2019t want to see repeated: five weeks after that hearing, the first lawsuit was filed in what became an avalanche of litigation that resulted in a $206bn judgment against big tobacco and a permanent sullying of its public image.The parallels with big oil today are uncanny. The big tobacco lawsuit was \u201cpremised on a simple notion\u201d, said Mike Moore, the attorney general of Mississippi, who initiated the case: \u201cYou caused the health crisis \u2013 you pay for it\u201d by reimbursing states for the extra costs that smoking imposed on their public health systems. Replace \u201cthe health crisis\u201d with \u201cthe climate crisis\u201d and you have the very same argument that New York, Massachusetts, Minnesota and dozens of other state and local governments have made in their pending lawsuits against oil companies.And just as tobacco companies lied for 40 years about the dangers of smoking, so too have the oil companies lied for decades about the dangers of burning fossil fuels. They saw today\u2019s climate crisis coming \u2013 their own scientists repeatedly warned top executives about it \u2013 and decided, bring it on.Given the stakes, it\u2019s odd that the CEOs of ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell aren\u2019t better known. As much as anyone, they are driving the earth\u2019s climate into chaos, yet most of us don\u2019t even know their names. The climate conversation usually focuses on governments and the politicians who run them, while the companies whose products cause the problem \u2013 and the executives who get paid astronomical sums for doing it \u2013 remain in the background. Which is doubtless how they like it.So, let\u2019s remember the names of the Big Oil 4 \u2013 Darren Woods of ExxonMobil, Michael Wirth of Chevron, David Lawler of BP and Gretchen Watkins of Shell Oil \u2013 and pay heed to what they say, or don\u2019t say, at the 28 October hearing.If we\u2019re lucky, C-Span and other cable networks will carry the hearing live. Watching the Big Oil 4 twist themselves into knots to avoid a repeat of big tobacco\u2019s debacle would be high entertainment, not to mention a bracing lesson in how elected officials can hold amoral corporations accountable.The big tobacco hearing made history with one simple question: do you think that nicotine is addictive? Here\u2019s the question for the Big Oil 4: will you apologize, here today, for your company\u2019s decades of lying about climate change?This story is published as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story.

The heat peaked in June and September, both record hot months in a series dating back to 1884. The UK\u2019s 10 warmest years have all occurred since 2003.Globally, 2023 is expected to have been the planet\u2019s hottest year on record, driven by carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere that are at their highest for at least 2m years and the return of the Pacific Ocean phenomenon known as El Ni\u00f1o.\u201cThe observations of the UK climate are clear,\u201d said Mike Kendon, at the Met Office. \u201cClimate change is influencing UK temperature records over the long term, with 2023 going down as another very warm year.\u201d\u201c2023 also had more than its fair share of rain, with impactful storms like Babet and Ciar\u00e1n influencing the figures,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate projections suggest an increase in the frequency of hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters. A warmer atmosphere has a greater capacity to hold moisture, so as our climate warms, we expect it to become wetter, too, and that trend is also apparent in the observations.\u201dThe average temperature in 2023 of 9.97C was marginally lower than the 10.03C recorded in 2022.

        "text": "As the coordinator of Hacan (Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise), I applaud Coco Khan\u2019s article for recognising noise as a serious health issue (Shout it from the rooftops: the noise pollution in towns and cities is killing us, 10 April). This is one that continues to fly beneath the radar and requires serious action from the government at all levels.According to the European Environment Agency, noise pollution is the second largest environmental threat to health, causing 12,000 premature deaths a year. Indeed, at Heathrow, at least 725,000 people are currently exposed to aircraft noise, with that figure expected to more than double should a third runway ever be built.While there is certainly a financial issue with regard to the ability to mitigate the impact of aircraft noise, or indeed move away from it entirely, the fact is that aircraft noise causes health problems for all. Worryingly, many people may not even be aware of it until the damage has been done.The delivery of an airspace modernisation programme over the next few years will see changes to flight paths across the country that will increase the intensity of noise for overflown communities and is likely to expose many communities to aircraft noise for the first time.Academic research has consistently shown that aircraft noise affects people\u2019s health at lower decibel levels than previously thought, and that people are becoming more sensitive to aircraft noise to a greater extent than other modes of transport.The fault ultimately lies at the feet of the government for the glacial pace of progress in addressing the problem of noise, despite the recognition of its harm to health. One simple solution exists to help local communities and that is to make aircraft noise a statutory nuisance.Paul BeckfordHeathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise I completely agree with Coco Khan\u2019s article and the insensitivity of people in urban residential areas who contribute inconsiderate additional noise pollution to the environment. Noise blaring out from wireless speakers is a new noise problem. People shouting \u201cAlexa, play\u2026\u201d across their garden at 1am is totally unacceptable, but this \u201cI\u2019m the king of my castle\u201d attitude has run amok through quiet middle England.The answer is simple in that local authorities can impose a \u201cquietude\u201d law, stating that no resident can make noise which permeates over their boundary at any time. However, policing this would be an issue.Nigel WheadonWitham, Essex Your article refers to noise in urban areas, but the myth that the countryside is quiet, particularly in the winter months, is untrue. From late September to late spring, and from dawn to dusk, the air is filled with the boom of numerous audio bird scarers, known as \u201cbangers\u201d. These propane-powered guns discharge at 120 decibels (about twice that allowed for motor vehicles) and fire up to 12 times an hour. The intention is protect young crops, but more often than not they are switched on for months at a time. Unlike other industries where operational hours and disturbance are controlled, there are no controls or regulations concerning the use of these devices, and environmental officers are powerless to take any action.The National Farmers\u2019 Union has produced a code on how they should be operated, saying that they should only be used as a last resort, but the code, without any legal backing, is usually ignored.Kenneth ParkerRattlesden, Suffolk Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

        "text": "The US Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday in effect vetoed a proposed copper and gold mine in a remote region of south-west Alaska that is coveted by mining interests but that also supports the world\u2019s largest sockeye salmon fishery.The move by the agency, heralded by Alaska Native tribes and environmentalists who have long pushed for it, deals a potentially devastating blow to the proposed Pebble mine and comes while an earlier rejection of a key federal permit for the project remains unresolved.John Shively, the CEO of Pebble Limited Partnership, in a statement called the EPA\u2019s action \u201cunlawful\u201d and political and said litigation was likely. Shively has cast the project as key to the Biden administration\u2019s push to reach green energy goals and make the US less dependent on foreign countries for such minerals.The Pebble Limited Partnership, the developer behind Pebble Mine, is owned by Canada-based Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd.Tuesday\u2019s announcement marks only the 14th time in the roughly 50-year history of the federal Clean Water Act that the EPA has flexed its powers to bar or restrict activities over potential impacts to waters, including fisheries.The EPA administrator, Michael Regan, said his agency\u2019s use of its so-called veto authority in this case \u201cunderscores the true irreplaceable and invaluable natural wonder that is Bristol Bay\u201d.The veto is a victory for the environment, economy and tribes of Alaska\u2019s Bristol Bay region, which have fought the proposal for more than a decade, said Joel Reynolds, western director and senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.The mine would have jeopardized the region\u2019s salmon fishery, which brings thousands of jobs to the area and supplies about half the world\u2019s sockeye salmon, Reynolds said.\u201cIt\u2019s a victory for science over politics. For biodiversity over extinction. For democracy over corporate power,\u201d Reynolds said.The Pebble deposit is near the headwaters of the Bristol Bay watershed, which supports a bounty of salmon \u201cunrivaled anywhere in North America\u201d, the EPA has said.The agency, citing an analysis by the US army corps of engineers, said discharges of dredged or fill material to build and operate the proposed mine site would result in a loss of nearly 100 miles (160km) of stream habitat, as well as wetland areas.The Pebble partnership has maintained the project can coexist with salmon. The partnership\u2019s website says the deposit is at the upper reaches of three \u201cvery small tributaries\u201d and expresses confidence any impacts on the fishery \u201cin the unlikely event of an incident\u201d would be \u201cminimal\u201d.Alannah Hurley, executive director of the United Tribes of Bristol Bay, welcomes the EPA\u2019s move: \u201cUnder President Biden, the EPA has not only restored its commitment to science and law but truly listened to the original stewards and first peoples of this land.\u201dAlaska\u2019s governor, Mike Dunleavy, a Republican, said the EPA\u2019s veto constituted a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d that could have ramifications down the road for development in the state. The state attorney general, Treg Taylor, also called the decision \u201clegally indefensible\u201d and a subversion of Alaska\u2019s permitting process.\u201cAlarmingly, it lays the foundation to stop any development project, mining or non-mining, in any area of Alaska with wetlands and fish-bearing streams,\u201d Dunleavy said.Tuesday\u2019s announcement represents the latest blow to the project. Late in former president Donald Trump\u2019s term in 2020, the army corps of engineers denied a key permit for the project. An appeal filed by the Pebble partnership is pending.The EPA\u2019s decision said it is prohibiting certain waters from being used as disposal sites for the discharge of material for the construction and operation of the project Pebble proposed. The decision also prohibits future proposals to build or operate a mine to develop the deposit that would result in the same or greater level of impacts and imposes restrictions related to future proposals to develop the deposit.Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, said she opposed the mine, but added the EPA\u2019s veto should not be allowed to jeopardize future mining operations in the state.The project is about 200 miles (320km) south-west of Anchorage. The nearest villages are within about 20 miles (32km) of the deposit.",

The colonies prey on invertebrates, larger vertebrates and plants, destroying native plants and out-competing native ants, insects and herbivores for food.The red fire ant is the fifth most costly invasive species in the world, spreading via human trade from its native South America into Mexico, the Caribbean, Australia and the US, where it causes an estimated damage of $6bn (\u00a34.8bn) each year.Researchers have identified 88 red fire ant nests across 5 hectares (12 acres) near the city of Syracuse, in Sicily, Italy. According to genetic analyses in a study published in Current Biology, the invasive colonies could have come from China or the US.Roger Vila, the principal investigator at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology\u2019s Butterfly Diversity and Evolution Lab, who led the study, said: \u201cCoordinated efforts for early detection and rapid response in the region are essential to successfully manage this new threat, before it spreads uncontrollably.\u201dThe charity Buglife said invasive ant species were easily spread when plants in soil are imported into Britain and called on the government to ban the import of soil.The EU has banned the export of soil from the UK but the UK has not taken reciprocal measures to stop imports , mostly via the horticultural trade.David Smith, of Buglife, said: \u201cIt\u2019s an open door for non-native species that are soil-dwellers. There\u2019s widespread concern about these non-native invasive ant species of which this is one of a handful which are on the cusp of making it into Europe.\u201cWe can do something to stop these arriving but once an invasive ant species is here it\u2019s going to be very hard to eradicate. Ants are notorious for being able to spread quickly.\u201dIn Europe, the ant has previously been found in imported products in Spain, Finland and the Netherlands but its establishment in the wild on the continent has never before been confirmed.While the EU has updated its \u201cspecies of concern\u201d list to include the red fire ant, the British government has not updated its list since Brexit despite calls from experts concerned about new invasive species.Smith added: \u201cWe\u2019re getting increasingly frustrated at government delays over biosecurity measures.\u201dAustralia is spending A$400m (\u00a3205m) on the ant\u2019s eradication but its government has been criticised for failing to act decisively enough to remove the species. New Zealand is the only country to have successfully eradicated the red fire ant after it appeared the country in 2001.The red fire ant is a heat-loving species but the researchers concluded that it could establish itself in approximately 7% of Europe.In today\u2019s climate, half of the urban areas in Europe would be climatically suitable for it, including large cities such as London, Paris, Rome and Barcelona. With global heating, the continent will become much more suitable for the species and help its spread across Europe.Mediterranean coastal cities are the most suitable to the ant, and their seaports could facilitate its spread.Mattia Menchetti, the lead author of the study, said: \u201cThe public could play a key role in the detection of S invicta, considering that it is frequently found in urban and adjacent areas. It is possible to detect this ant due to its painful stings and the characteristic mounds of their nests, although confirmation of an expert is required.\u201dThe Sicilian colonies are located in an estuary and natural park in the suburbs of Syracuse. Researchers believe wind-assisted flying queen ants arrived there from the port of Syracuse to the north-west. The team has recommended further monitoring of the port.

        "text": "The National Trust has called on the UK government to introduce legislation that recognises the importance of adapting buildings, coastlines and countryside to make sure they can cope with the effects of the climate emergency.It is arguing a new \u201cClimate Resilience Act\u201d should set targets on preparing for the risk posed by rising temperatures and extreme weather, saying \u201curgent and unswerving attention\u201d on the issue is needed.The conservation charity is to publish a landmark report on Monday setting out the work it is doing to adapt, such as working with landowners to slow the flow of water off hillsides by restoring peatland or plant trees; restoring river flood plains; and even reviving traditional roofing methods that offer older buildings more protection.Patrick Begg, the outdoors and natural resources director at the National Trust, said it was a pivotal moment. \u201cWe\u2019re at a point where we we need to raise a flag,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re living the change. There are some serious, serious impacts happening.\u201dThe report, \u201cA climate for change\u201d, says that about 70% of the places it cares for could be at \u201cmedium or high risk\u201d of climate hazards by 2060.The Parterre at Wimpole Hall, Cambridgeshire. Photograph: National Trust ImagesBegg said: \u201cThe National Trust is a canary in the mine and every corner we look in is being affected by climate. Being resilient and thinking ahead has never been more needed. This report is drawing that line in the sand and saying this is the moment where we really need to respond properly.\u201cYou don\u2019t call lightly for legislation. I worry that political timeframes, electoral cycles \u2013 none of them lend themselves really well to coping with long-term adaptive change.\u201d But he said the trust believed new laws were needed.The report recommends that the UK government should commit to bringing in clear legal duties and targets for adaptation in the first session of the next parliament. This, it says, could include a statutory duty on public bodies to make climate adaptation a vital factor in decision-making across the UK, which it says could be modelled on measures already in place in the Wellbeing of Future Generations Act in Wales. It suggests a minister for climate adaptation either within the Cabinet Office or the Treasury.In Wales, the report is calling for more resources to be made available to Cadw, the Welsh government\u2019s historic environment service. In Northern Ireland, it says there should be a statutory duty for public bodies to plan for coastal change and its longer-term effects on communities, the environment and infrastructure. The report does not touch on Scotland as the charity does not cover the country.An example of adaptation Begg gave is at Fountains Abbey, the magnificent ruins near Ripon, North Yorkshire, that are in peril when the River Skell floods.Begg said: \u201cIt can\u2019t be just about protecting or changing things within the boundary. You have to go right upstream and work with landowners, farmers and the other recreational users on the top of the catchment of the river. And past Fountains Abbey, there are benefits for the community downstream, protecting people in Ripon so water doesn\u2019t come rushing into their front rooms.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Fake news and state-backed disinformation are fuelling Chinese anger at Japan over its release of treated wastewater from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant.In the last week, there have been reports of rocks and eggs thrown at Japanese schools in two Chinese cities, abusive phone calls to Japanese businesses and social media campaigns to boycott Japanese products including cosmetics. It has prompted Japan\u2019s government to summon the Chinese ambassador and urge caution among its China-based citizens.Japan began its release of more than 1m tonnes of water on 24 August. The process, which is expected to take decades, has been approved by the UN atomic watchdog and mirrors similar wastewater releases by other countries including China. However, several countries have expressed concerns or objections, with China and Hong Kong announcing bans on importing Japanese seafood.The release of the treated water tapped into anti-Japanese sentiment in China, fuelled by government statements and state media that has loudly questioned the science behind the process, and accused Japan\u2019s government of endangering the region.Fake or misattributed videos have claimed sea life is turning up dead on beaches, that there have been mass protests, and that a Japanese official who drank treated water from Fukushima at a 2011 press conference had died. Some examples collated by an Australian-based China analyst, Han Yang, on X, formerly known as Twitter, included footage of a rally in South Korea reported by Chinese state media as being in Japan, and fake news about a Japanese politician apparently suggesting Chinese visitors should be made to eat shellfish from Fukushima.News articles have also reported panic buying of salt in the belief that iodine will provide protection from radiation, and of Geiger counters to detect radiation.A study by the UK-based data analysis firm Logically found there were high volumes of state media reports and paid advertisements in multiple languages about the risk posed by the wastewater. It found unique posts about the topic on social media, by Chinese state media, officials and influencers, peaked at more than 3,500 in July, with some garnering more than a million views each.\u201cChina\u2019s coordinated campaign amplifies climate change misinformation and health misinformation around wastewater release,\u201d said Logically. \u201cLogically identified similar coordinated campaigns with the Ohio train derailment in February 2023 where pro-China influencers cautioned its citizens not to consume \u2018contaminated\u2019 products from Ohio.\u201dOne video produced by the People\u2019s Daily, titled \u201cthe truth of Fukushima\u201d, claims there is a Japanese plot to knowingly discharge water that will \u201cchange\u201d the sea while deliberately ignoring safer options. It carries tens of thousands of comments, many highly critical of Japan. A related hashtag has been engaged with more than 180m times in the last week.Anti-Japanese sentiment has long existed in China due to a fractious history between the two countries, but has been prevalent in recent years as Japan strengthens ties with the US and Taiwan and pushes back on Beijing\u2019s regional expansionism and military aggression.Logically suggested China\u2019s retaliatory reaction to the water release could continue, with a cosmetics ban potentially following the seafood ban, and Chinese state media predictions of mass Japanese restaurant closures in China and Hong Kong. \u201cThis could possibly have broader geopolitical implications and lead to an escalation of tensions between the two countries,\u201d it said.After the most recent spate of hostility, the Japanese government has taken the extraordinary step of warning its citizens not to speak Japanese too loudly in China. Last week Japan\u2019s foreign ministry summoned China\u2019s ambassador to request that Beijing urge calm among its citizens and ensure the safety of Japanese residents and businesses.\u201cRegarding Alps [advanced liquid processing system] treated water, we should not unnecessarily heighten people\u2019s anxiety by disseminating information that is not based on scientific basis, and we once again strongly urge that accurate information be disseminated,\u201d the vice-minister Masataka Okano said.When asked if the government would urge calm among citizens, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, told foreign media that China ensured the safety of foreign nationals, but said Tokyo\u2019s \u201cunilateral\u201d release of the water had caused global outrage and this was the \u201croot cause of the current situation\u201d.Additional research by Tau Yang",

        "text": "An orca repeatedly rammed a yacht in the North Sea off Shetland on Monday, in a concerning development following previous interactions between the cetaceans and vessels in the strait of Gibraltar and Portugal.Dr Wim Rutten, a 72-year-old retired Dutch physicist and experienced yachtsperson, was sailing solo from Lerwick to Bergen in Norway. He was fishing for mackerel, with a single line off the back of the boat, when the orca suddenly appeared in the clear water, and hit the stern of the seven-ton boat.\u201cI said: \u2018Shit!\u2019\u201d Rutten, who said he had heard about the \u201cPortuguese accidents\u201d, told the Guardian. The whale hit again and again, creating \u201csoft shocks\u201d through the aluminium hull.\u201cWhat I felt [was] most frightening was the very loud breathing of the animal,\u201d he said. The orca stayed behind the boat \u201clooking for the keel. Then he disappeared ... but came back at fast speed, twice or thrice ... and circled a bit.\u201cMaybe he just wanted to play. Or look me in the eyes. Or to get rid of the fishing line.\u201dThis is the same behaviour that has been seen in the Iberian orca population, but it is the first time it has been known to happen in northern waters.Highly social cetaceans, orcas (also known as killer whales) use complex vocalisations to communicate and to hunt for food, from small fish to blue whales. They learn matrilineally, and post-menopausal females assume the greatest importance in individual pods. \u201cGrandmothers\u201d in the Iberian population have been seen observing during the interactions with yachts and other vessels.Experts believe this could be play among juvenile orcas. Dr Alfredo L\u00f3pez, of the Grupo de Trabajo Orca Atl\u00e1ntica in Portugal, said: \u201cWe know that many boats use fishing lines from the stern to fish and it is a motivation for orcas, they come to examine them.\u201d But the focus on boats\u2019 rudders may come from adult whales who have developed an aversion towards boats, perhaps because they \u201chad a bad experience and try to stop the boat so as not to repeat it\u201d.Most surprising is the fact that this learned behaviour should have appeared nearly 2,000 miles (3,200km) from Gibraltar. Dr Conor Ryan, a scientific adviser to the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, who has studied orca pods off the Scottish coast, said: \u201cI\u2019d be reluctant to say it cannot be learned from [the southern population]. It\u2019s possible that this \u2018fad\u2019 is leapfrogging through the various pods/communities.\u201dRyan suggests there may be \u201chighly mobile pods that could transmit this behaviour a long distance\u201d. L\u00f3pez thinks, however, \u201cthat human activities, even in an indirect way, are at the origin of this behaviour\u201d. Increased marine traffic, dwindling food sources, warming seas and noise pollution could all play a part.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Monday\u2019s civil disobedience had a different but compatible goal, said Renata Pumarol, an organizer with the campaign group Climate Defenders.\u201cToday we want to make sure people know banks, big banks, are responsible for climate change, too,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd while marches are important, we think civil disobedience is, too, because it shows we\u2019re willing to do whatever it takes to end fossil fuels, including putting ourselves on the line.\u201dMonday\u2019s action was organized by a coalition of local organizations including New York Communities for Change and Extinction Rebellion NYC, alongside national groups such as Climate Organizing Hub and 350.org. Demonstrators first gathered in New York\u2019s Zuccotti Park, in the financial district in lower Manhattan, which is partially owned by the fossil fuel investor Goldman Sachs.The small concrete urban space was the base for the original Occupy Wall Street protests 12 years ago.On Monday, demonstrators then marched in the rain to the nearby New York Federal Reserve building, the largest of the network of 12 federal banks dotted around the country that make up the central bank of the United States.Protesters blockaded multiple entrances into the bank while singing, beating drums and holding up signs. More than 100 people were arrested, according to the New York City office of the deputy commissioner for public information, with organizers estimating that roughly 150 arrests were made.\u201cIf you arrest one of us, one hundred more will come,\u201d activists chanted.The protesters called attention to both public and private fossil fuel financing. Globally, government subsidies for coal, oil and gas reached a record high of $13m a minute in 2022 last year \u2013 equivalent to 7% of global GDP and almost double what the world spends on education \u2013 according to the International Monetary Fund.Last year, the US also ranked 16th among the G20 countries on a scorecard by the independent economic research group Green Central Banking, which the researchers say indicates US financial regulators are falling behind their international peers on climate risk mitigation.Meanwhile, since the signing of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, major private banks have provided some $3.2tn to the fossil fuel industry to expand operations, far outstripping the amount that global north governments have collectively spent on international climate finance, an analysis from ActionAid, the Washington DC-based non-profit, found this month. Another recent analysis from the Sierra Club environmental group found that major global banks have announced climate pledges but nonetheless financed coal energy across the US.Monday\u2019s action came after a slew of global protests last week, some of which targeted financial institutions. In New York, dozens rallied outside the headquarters for the asset manager BlackRock and Citibank on Wednesday and Thursday respectively, to call attention to both firms\u2019 investments in fossil fuels. And on Friday, protesters targeted the Museum of Modern Art over its relationship with the fossil fuel investor KKR.Another protest is planned for Tuesday at New York City\u2019s Bank of America offices, with additional actions throughout the week as the United Nations hosts its Climate Ambition Summit as part of the UNGA.",

Morocco is suffering its worst drought in four decades, and grain production is down by about 70% due to the extremely dry conditions.Breeders and farmers in drought-affected areas planted numerous new durum wheat varieties between 2017 and 2021. Jabal stood out as it was able to flourish and produce grains while all commercial varieties of durum failed. Its distinctive black spikes also produced high yields of plump grains that made tasty bread, scientists said.Jabal\u2019s black spikes. Photograph: Michael Major/Crop Trust\u201cMany farmers said it was love at first sight when they saw it standing strong when all other varieties were being destroyed by drought,\u201d said Filippo Bassi, senior scientist with the durum wheat breeding program at the International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (Icarda) in Lebanon.Wheat, the most widely consumed grain globally, is grown on every continent apart from Antarctica and eaten by billions of people.Crop failures due to lost biodiversity and extreme weather events such as drought, extreme heat and floods have led to rising wheat prices and food insecurity in many parts of the world, exacerbated by Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, as both countries were major wheat exporters.The race against time to breed a wheat to survive the climate crisisRead moreLast year, prices for durum wheat soared by 90% after widespread drought and unprecedented heatwaves in Canada, one of the world\u2019s biggest grain producers, followed a few months later by record rainfall. Over the last century, Canadian farmers have increasingly relied on genetically similar high-yield wheat varieties, elbowing out crucial diversity.It takes years to breed new wheat varieties, in a complicated, never-ending race against time, as global heating drives climate disasters and the emergence of new, adapted or more aggressive pathogens.Wild relatives are considered the more resilient cousins of commercial crops, having evolved in nature to survive tough conditions such as extreme heat, drought, flooding and poor soils. Plant breeders are increasingly looking to wild and other forgotten varieties stored in seed banks for useful genetic diversity, which was sidelined in favor of yield, uniformity and profits after the Green Revolution.But the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems warns that in addition to genetic diversity, building resilience in the food system also requires diversity on farms and in landscapes, as well as more farmer led initiatives.\u201cFarmers have domesticated 7000 different crop species and have donated more than 2.1m plant varieties to international gene banks, but most of the profit from this effort has been captured by four or five international seed companies,\u201d said Pat Mooney, an expert in agricultural diversity and biotechnology. \u201c[Jabal] shows what can be accomplished with multilateral cooperation where farmers are at the centre of decision-making.\u201d",

I too love the museum. Bad management in hard times has fuelled a lack of confidence. It fails to confront difficult issues with openness and honesty, one symptom being the absurd degree to which its extraordinary curatorial expertise is barely heard from, within and outside its walls. Another is the low public awareness of many of the good things it does achieve.Behind this lies years of underfunding, as Higgins says, but unlike her, I would not demand that BP\u2019s cash should be denied. For the museum, \u00a350m is a large sum, signing intent for its transformative and essential reimagination that will cost many times that gift. For BP it is small. It will do nothing to alter its public reputation; most visitors are oblivious to sponsorship, and those more aware\u00a0know their own minds. We live in a world built on oil. That is changing, but essential emissions targets will not be met without action from oil producers.Colourful, principled protest may feel like help, but in reality it does more to allow the smug to brand change as the realm of the hypocritical and rude, when of course it is about us all.

Housing estates built in the 1990s have 19% more local public footpaths than estates predominantly built in the  21st century.The bottom five local authority areas for public footpath provision in England and Wales are Norwich, North East Lincolnshire, Liverpool, Southampton and Blackpool, while the best are Rossendale, Stroud, Monmouthshire, Malvern Hills and Calderdale.Graph on deprivation and footpathsPeople in Norwich have on average just 129 metres of public rights of way within 800 metres (a 10-minute walk) of where they live, while in Rossendale in east Lancashire, on the border with Greater Manchester, on average people enjoy 9,232 metres of footpath within a 10-minute walk.The worst parliamentary constituency for public paths is Liverpool Riverside, followed by Cardiff Central.\u201cWe\u2019ve overlooked our paths as critical national infrastructure,\u201d said Jack Cornish, the head of paths for the Ramblers. \u201cThis research [shows] that governments are missing an open goal. It\u2019s clear that availability of paths close to people\u2019s home[s] has a massive impact on health outcomes \u2013 but at the moment it\u2019s the old, the healthy, the wealthy and the white that are primarily enjoying the benefits.\u201dGraph on ethnicity and footpathsAccording to the study, undertaken by the New Economics Foundation (NEF) for the walking charity, the inequalities of access to public paths could be addressed by reinstating \u201clost\u201d rights of way, as well as protecting existing paths.If public rights of way had been fully recorded and protected over the past eight decades, every community would have on average 38% more local public paths than they do today. The most deprived communities in England and Wales would benefit from about 63% more paths in their local area if all public paths had been accurately registered in legal records from the 1950s onwards.MapThe Ramblers is campaigning for \u201clost\u201d public paths to be registered before a 2026 deadline. They are also calling for new paths, particularly to enable new edge-of-town developments to reach green countryside and town centres on foot, and the creation of green urban corridors to encourage more walking in busy cities where there are plenty of roads but fewer peaceful, pedestrian-friendly avenues.Despite hundreds of studies showing the physical and mental health benefits of being active in green spaces, previous Ramblers research suggests that on average only 57% of adults report living within five minutes\u2019 walk of a green space. This drops to 46% for households on incomes lower than \u00a315,000 a year.The NEF analysis suggests that doubling the average length of paths in a neighbourhood would result in an additional annual 78.5m walks being taken in nature across England and Wales.The study calculates that the government would need to invest an additional \u00a3650m each year \u2013 \u00a312 a person \u2013 to expand the path network and address the inequalities of access to it and nature.Cornish said: \u201cIt needs to be targeted at local authorities after 13 years of austerity. If local authorities can raise the level of provision, that additional investment would pay dividends because you get almost \u00a32bn of wellbeing value from the network, and that\u2019s not including economic and tourism benefits.\u201dThe Ramblers is calling for stronger planning rules that stipulate footpath provision around new housing, and investment to improve existing paths and make them more accessible. According to a YouGov survey for the Ramblers, 56% of people with disabilities said they did not use public footpaths because of physical barriers.\u201cWe\u2019ve got thousands of stiles in fields that haven\u2019t seen a cow for 50 years,\u201d said Cornish.Investment in public footpaths is popular, with 71% of nearly 5,000 adults surveyed in the YouGov poll saying that more money, time and resources should be invested in the network of public paths.",

Twitter was also the only platform to lack a clear reporting process for flagging harmful or misleading content for higher review.Tech platforms have long struggled with creating effective or coherent policies on content moderation, while events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 US presidential election resulted in swaths of misinformation circulating online. Amid conservative backlash and labor cuts in the tech industry, many companies have also deprioritized content moderation and opened the door to potential surges in misinformation on their platforms.Although the other platforms fared better, none ranked especially high on the report\u2019s scale \u2013 Pinterest scored highest with 12 points out of a possible 21. Issues ranged from a lack of clear definitions of what constituted climate misinformation, failure to enforce existing policies in a transparent way and a lack of proof that companies apply these policies equally across different languages. None of the companies release public reports on how their algorithmic changes affect climate misinformation, according to the report.The organization\u2019s authors advocate for a number of changes to big tech\u2019s policies, including establishing clear guidelines on climate and updating privacy policies to show when private data is being sold to advertisers that could be linked to the fossil fuel industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Starmer said: \u201cWe will accept the baseline that we inherit from the government if we win that election \u2026 in order to ensure we have the stability that we desperately need in our economy.\u201dJoe Hesmondhalgh, 24, a farm worker and volunteer at Green New Deal Rising who had been protesting outside shadow cabinet offices, said Labour must go further.\u201cThis government\u2019s approval of the Rosebank oil and gas field condemns young people like me to an unliveable future. If the Labour party truly wants to represent us, they must definitely oppose Rishi Sunak\u2019s climate extremism and commit to revoking Rosebank\u2019s licence and delivering a transformative Green New Deal if they win power,\u201d Hesmondhalgh said.Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary of state for energy security and net zero, said this week that Labour would double down on making the case that tackling the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis could only be done in tandem, despite the intensifying Conservative attack on net zero policies.He said Labour would argue that seeking green growth was the way to bring down household bills and secure the future of the UK economy. He said the party believed that Rishi Sunak\u2019s U-turns on key net zero policies revealed a weakness in his strategy, a lack of vision for future economic growth, and would add to the cost of living for people on low incomes.As well as committing to revoke Rosebank, Green New Deal Rising campaigners want the party to go further at its upcoming conference in Liverpool, promising to expand public ownership of key utilities, introduce a green jobs guarantee, create a national nature service and use wealth taxes and taxes on fossil fuel companies and big corporations to pay for the increased investment in the UK and to provide finance for other countries to adapt to and mitigate climate impacts.Hannah Martin, a co-director of Green New Deal Rising, said: \u201cApproving the Rosebank oil and gas field is just this government\u2019s latest act of climate destruction and Labour must commit to revoking that licence. Half-measures will not tackle the climate and cost of living crisis that we face. It is time for Keir Starmer to step up and commit to a Green New Deal to meet the big challenges of our time.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Its most evangelical users claim the protein can improve hair, skin, nails and joints, slowing the ageing process. As well as beauty and wellness brands, it is also used by pharmaceutical companies and those producing food ingredients.However, an investigation by the Guardian, Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Center for Climate Crime Analysis (CCCA), ITV and O Joio e O Trigo in Brazil has found cattle raised on farms causing deforestation were processed at abattoirs serving international collagen supply chains.Some of this collagen can be traced to Nestl\u00e9-owned Vital Proteins, a leading producer of bovine collagen supplements. Vital Proteins\u2019 collagen range is sold globally, including in the US and UK.Jennifer Aniston, the actor and chief creative officer of Vital Proteins, has called collagen \u201cthe glue that holds everything together\u201d. She claims to have been using it for years, adding it to her morning coffee.While there are studies suggesting taking collagen orally can improve joint and skin health, Harvard School of Public Health cautions potential conflicts of interest exist as most if not all of the research is either funded by the industry or carried out by scientists affiliated with it.Collagen companies have no obligation to track its environmental impacts. Unlike beef, soya, palm oil and other food commodities, collagen is also not covered by forthcoming due diligence legislation in the EU and UK designed to tackle deforestation.Nestl\u00e9 said that the allegations raised are not in line with its commitment to responsible sourcing and that it has contacted its supplier to investigate. It added that it is taking steps to \u201censure its products are deforestation-free by 2025\u201d.What is collagen and why is it so popular in the beauty industry?Read moreBovine collagen is described as a byproduct of the cattle industry, which in Brazil accounts for 80% of all Amazon forest loss.But \u201cbyproduct\u201d is a misleading term, according to campaigners. Non-meat products, of which leather and collagen are the most valuable, account for just under half a slaughtered cow\u2019s weight and can generate up to 20% of meatpackers\u2019 incomes, according to the USDA.Demand for beef, leather and collagen has seen more and more forest has been cleared and replaced by pasture in recent years, with land often seized illegally.Most livestock-driven deforestation can be attributed to companies\u2019 indirect suppliers, according to Ricardo Negrini, a federal prosecutor in Brazil\u2019s Par\u00e1 state who monitors beef processors\u2019 climate commitments.Cattle are often moved from farm to farm for different stages of rearing, so a cow born on deforested land may be fattened for slaughter at a \u201cclean\u201d finishing ranch.

But like other UK cities, Birmingham suffers from an excess of single occupancy car journeys, he added.Twenty-five per cent of the city\u2019s car journeys are one mile or shorter, Zaffar said. To convert people to cleaner and healthier forms of transport, the city, including the central area, will be split into seven zones, and rather than driving directly between zones, motorists will be diverted via the A4540 ring road.Birmingham traffic planBirmingham\u2019s transport plan also states that the \u201callocation of road space will change away from prioritising private cars to support the delivery of public transport and active travel networks fit for a global city\u201d.Birmingham will pedestrianise further parts of the city centre and reduce the availability of car parking through the removal of spaces, steeply increased pricing and clamping down on footway parking.The second largest city in the UK has a population of 1.2 million and an additional 150,000 residents are forecast to arrive within 20 years.The council believes the city must act now to respond to this predicted expansion and tackle the climate emergency. The council also wants to combat poor health, reduce costly congestion and attract more inward investment.\u201cActive travel will become the mode of choice for short trips,\u201d promises the plan, which councillors are expected to vote through at a meeting on 12 October.Businesses and citizens commented on an earlier draft of the transport plan, released in 2020. The final report is just as radical as the original, said Zaffar.\u201cThe key principles are the same,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want these changes\u201d.Low-traffic schemes halve number of road injuries, study showsRead moreMost businesses supported the proposed workplace parking levy, and residents strongly welcomed the promise of more protected cycleways.\u201cIntroducing the blue cycling lanes was probably the most popular thing the council has done in a long time,\u201d said Zaffar, who is the Labour councillor for Lozells, one of the city\u2019s most deprived areas.A type 2 diabetic and former petrolhead, Zaffar is a convert to active travel. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t get me out of my car four years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI would take journeys of less than one mile by car; I hadn\u2019t been on a bus since my university days, and I had never cycled until the summer of 2018\u201d.Now he cycles, uses the city\u2019s Voi e-scooters, and plans to become a regular bus user. \u201cI should also walk more,\u201d he said.Before he became a politician, Zaffar was a trade union representative for Birmingham\u2019s taxi drivers, but he now recognises the health downsides of driving for a living.\u201cI often talk to [the city\u2019s taxi drivers] about the impact of sitting behind the wheel for long hours and the damage that pollution has on health. This [plan] is about reversing their health inequalities too\u201d.For Zaffar, the transport plan is personal. \u201cMy father was a taxi driver in Birmingham \u2013 in 2009, he suddenly died at the age of 54. Every day I think about the consequences of his job behind the wheel of a car and how that ultimately led to his untimely demise.\u201dZaffar expects that when building work starts on creating the zones, there will be stiff opposition from some motorists, and he is steeling himself for abuse and threats.But, he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t come into politics to win popularity contests; I came into politics to change lives for the better.\u201cI\u2019m the proudest Brummie there is, and this is where my kids will grow up.

The proposal would also be woven into the planning approval of any mine.The inquiry, which was established in July, examined the impacts of mining on human health, land, air and water quality.Among its 11 recommendations was to run a statewide education campaign on the care and maintenance of rainwater tanks and the safe use of water. Assessing the results of upcoming hair and blood tests from residents surrounding the Cadia mine, and whether the results will inform a greater public health response was another recommendation.Proposed amendments to the Environmental Planning and Assessment act to mandate baseline studies of heavy metals in water tanks, creeks, farm dams and groundwater surrounding potential mine sites was knocked back, along with funding roles within the EPA to consult with NSW Health.The committee chair, Greens MP Dr Amanda Cohn, dissented from the final report, which she said was a \u201cmissed opportunity to recommend strengthened regulatory frameworks,\u201d with no recommendations to include the consideration of health impacts in assessing mining proposals.\u201cThe finding that the regulatory bodies responsible for mining projects and the detailed frameworks they administer \u2018are fundamentally sound\u2019 goes against the vast majority of the detailed and convincing evidence the Committee received,\u201d she said.\u201cIt is devastating for the committee to have produced a report from which I must dissent significantly.\u201dBec Price, a cattle farmer who lives downstream of the proposed McPhillamys gold project said she felt \u201clet down\u201d by the report.\u201cWe are bitterly disappointed by the watered down recommendations handed down by politicians who have the opportunity to strengthen the regulatory framework, protect communities, who are the frontline people with these mining companies,\u201d she said.\u201cThe regulatory framework is skewed towards mining companies and proponents applying for mining licences and this inquiry did have the opportunity to make it more fair. However, they have let us down once again.\u201dFurther draft recommendations that were either voted down or omitted from the final report included a proposal to expand the role of industry safety and health representatives, also known as check inspectors or \u201ccheckies\u201d, which are a regular part of the coal mining industry, to metalliferous mines.The inspectors are elected by unionised employees on coalmine sites and are empowered by the Workplace Health and Safety Act to ensure safety standards are met and to shut down unsafe sites.A recommendation to review the resources regulator and ensure it had sufficient staff and funding, including for workplace inspectors servicing regional mining areas, was also voted down.Gary Rush, who is part of the Mudgee Region Action Group, said he was disappointed by the report.\u201cWe have a fundamental belief in proper democracy and a democratic system that is going to provide us with decisions that support people\u2019s health, communities, people\u2019s current livelihood and that\u2019s what we are all there to protect,\u201d he said.A spokesperson for the NSW EPA said they \u201cwelcome the report\u201d and are reviewing the recommendations while continuing to work with communities across the state.The government response to the report will be presented in March 2024.\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community\nThis article was amended on 15 December 2023 to correct the number of recommendations (11) made in the report mentioned.\n",

The lender has also been hit by grassroots boycotts, including by a pensioner who refused to pay her council tax because of a link to the bank.Campaigners are concerned over Barclays\u2019 support of carbon-heavy industries, having been the top European funder of fossil fuels between 2016 and 2022, according to the Rainforest Action Network\u2019s banking on climate chaos report.However, Barclays stressed it was working towards plans to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and noted that its energy sector financing had dropped by 25% since 2021.Campaigners said the creation of such a high-level climate communications role was a sign that Barclays was growing \u201cscared\u201d of climate activists.Climate protesters rework Spice Girls song to disrupt Barclays AGMRead moreJoanna Warrington, at Fossil Free London, said: \u201cIn recent years we\u2019ve seen campaigning pressure expand beyond the oil giants like Shell and Equinor, on to banks and the massive funding they provide to companies building new oil and gas projects that would be impossible without it.

The bank has faced criticism over its impact on indigenous rights via pipeline funding. Citigroup did not respond to a request for comment.Richard Brooks, the climate finance director at the environmental group Stand.earth, said: \u201cMajor banks hiring senior staff as spin doctors to green their bad images on climate issues rather than actually tackling their fossil fuel financing is utterly sickening, given the deaths in Hawaii, fires in Canada\u2019s Arctic and extreme heat all over North America.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the new research shows total ecosystem collapse is \u201cinevitable\u201d, if the losses are not reversed, the scientists said.The Permian-Triassic extinction event, known as the \u201cGreat Dying\u201d occurred 252 million years ago. It was driven by global heating resulting from huge volcanic eruptions and wiped out 95% of life on Earth.However, species are being lost today even faster than in any of the previous five mass extinctions that have struck the planet. Wildlife is being destroyed via the razing of natural habitats for farming and mining, pollution and overhunting. Humanity relies on healthy global ecosystems for clean air and water, as well as food.The new research examined in detail marine fossils found in China from before, during and after the Great Dying. Healthy ecosystems rely on the complex interaction of plants, predators and prey, with each group of similar species playing a unique role.\u2018Crucial\u2019 Cop15 deal includes target to protect 30% of nature on Earth by 2030Read moreThe scientists found half the species went extinct with virtually no change in the overall functioning of the ecosystem, because some creatures still remained in each role. However, once the last species in each role began to go extinct, the ecosystem rapidly collapsed. \u201cEcosystems were pushed to a tipping point from which they could not recover,\u201d said Dr Yuangeng Huang, at the China University of Geosciences and lead author of the study.\u201cWe are currently losing species at a faster rate than in any of Earth\u2019s past extinction events. It is probable that we are in the first phase of another, more severe mass extinction,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot predict the tipping point that will send ecosystems into total collapse, but it is an inevitable outcome if we do not reverse biodiversity loss.\u201dThe research, published in the journal Current Biology, examined fossils from south China, which was a shallow sea during the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. The team recreated the ancient marine environment using simulated food webs to represent the ecosystem before, during, and after the extinction event.The Great Dying was caused by volcanic eruptions that drove up carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, resulting in climate conditions similar to those being caused today by fossil fuel burning, ie global heating, ocean acidification and loss of oxygen in the seas.In the first phase of the extinction, a sufficient number of species remained to perform essential functions, said Dr Peter Roopnarine at the California Academy of Sciences: \u201cBut when environmental disturbances like global warming or ocean acidification occurred later on, ecosystems were missing that reinforced resistance, which led to abrupt ecological collapse.

It has been more than five years since world leaders pledged to limit global warming to 1.5C. Since then, emissions have continued to rise, and according to the International Energy Agency emissions will hit a record high by 2023 if green recovery fails. The newest report published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that human-caused emissions have already contributed to irreversible changes in our climate system, and are rapidly moving us toward an uninhabitable planet.What we really need as world leaders gather for the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow is a global system change. A world built on business as usual is clearly falling apart \u2013 it has already for the most vulnerable.The world economy is reliant on constant growth and human exploitation in order to create profits. That\u2019s why it is no surprise to see that a country\u2019s rise in emissions correlates with its growth in GDP, energy consumption and pollution. But the capitalist growth model is incompatible with a zero-carbon world.By popularizing concepts such as \u201cgreen growth\u201d or \u201cgreen capitalism\u201d, world leaders sentence humanity to a life of dystopia.

Activists call it greenwashing for a reason.The climate crisis may center on the term 'climate', but in fact it may be one of the biggest social crises humanity has ever facedWhen high-income nations transition their economies toward \u201cgreen\u201d solutions, what happens to low-income nations? Will the global north continue to exploit other countries in order to deliver on their climate pledges while also growing their economies? And what about climate reparations for the most affected communities?While leaders of the global north continue to perpetuate the status quo built on the exploitation of others, they deepen the harsh socio-economic conditions in countries that bring them profits. In other words, high-income nations use \u201cgrowth\u201d as a justification for the torture caused in other territories.Low-income nations are robbed of their ability to address the climate crisis when more immediate issues become a necessary priority, such as feeding their people, securing access to electricity, quality healthcare and education or ending conflict. Climate change worsens these \u201cmore pressing\u201d issues, perpetuating the downward cycle even more.The climate crisis may center on the term \u201cclimate\u201d, but it may be one of the biggest social crises humanity has ever faced. Hence, climate justice cannot be achieved without addressing and prioritizing social justice in all parts of the globe.I think about the climate crisis and its intersectional connections every single day. I started my activism journey more than two years ago and have called myself a full-time activist since summer 2020. While activism may take a toll on my physical and mental wellbeing, I find it\u2019s the best antidote for climate depression.Communities fighting on the frontlines have already been transforming their radical imagination of a fully liberated world into a realityUtopia quite literally means achieving a perfect imaginary world that doesn\u2019t exist (from Greek ou-topos \u2013 no place, nowhere). However, striving toward a near-utopian state is the only chance we have today to save humanity.In today\u2019s world, limiting the global average temperature to 1.5C and achieving climate justice may seem out of reach due to the fundamentals on which the global north has built its societies. However, the miracle happens when one realizes that this system is not inherently this way \u2013 it was created.The utopia we dream of is within our reach if we address the colonial, racist and oppressive roots of our current planetary crisis. Communities fighting on the frontlines have already been transforming their radical imagination of a fully liberated world into a reality.Everything has to change, especially our understanding of the impossible.",

But down here, my attention is focused under the box hedges of my herb garden. I am watching volcanoes form.

They are just one of the 240 species of solitary bees in Britain, and are just as important for pollination as the one species of honeybee. Each has different shaped mouthparts, which have evolved alongside flowers with different access routes to their nectar so that the plants are more likely to be pollinated from the same species. And you don\u2019t have to farm the solitaries. This type needs only fine, sandy soil so they can dig deep burrows (and surprisingly quickly too with their tiny legs). They make side chambers and lay one egg in each, with a small supply of nectar and pollen. Then they\u2019re sealed up and the larvae left to hibernate over winter, until they dig their way out the next spring.I could never grow Mediterranean herbs such as thyme, sage, oregano, orpine or lavender in my damp garden until a few years ago, when I had this square dug out and filled with limestone hardcore. Unwittingly, I had also made the perfect place for these mining bees to breed. It also helped that this was under the bit of lawn where we once had the kids\u2019 sandpit.Meanwhile, the osmia mining bees \u2013 the red mason and the leafcutter bees you can buy nesting houses for in garden shops \u2013 are a different species. I was puzzled to see an osmia scrabbling against the mud-sealed doors once, as I thought it couldn\u2019t be a predator of its own kind.

However, research indicates that the environmental benefit is heavily dependent on the scale and type of restoration, and requires huge areas of land. One 2019 study estimated that allowing natural forests to regenerate could return 40 times as much carbon as plantations.Jes\u00fas Aguirre-Guti\u00e9rrez, an ecologist at the University of Oxford who led the paper, said the scientists decided to say something after witnessing the increase in commercial plantations in the tropics.\u2018Tree-planting should not be seen as an alternative to rapidly cutting fossil fuel emissions,\u2019 said Simon Lewis from University College London. Photograph: Gabriela Biro/Alamy\u201cWe carry out a lot of fieldwork in the tropics to research what is happening with climate change and we have seen the boom in these plantations for ourselves: teaks, conifer and eucalyptus, just one or two species,\u201d he said. \u201cThese schemes are a win for the company planting these trees but not for biodiversity. This is the start of this phenomenon, hence the seriousness of the situation.\u201dThe paper estimates that a plantation across the combined size of the US, China, Russia and the UK would have to be planted in order to sequester one year of emissions.While plantations are often more economically viable than standing forests, the paper highlights that they often support a lower level of biodiversity. For example, in the Brazilian Cerrado savanna, a 40% rise in woodland cover reduced the diversity of plants and ants by about 30%.Campaigners urge Prince William to rewild Dartmoor farmlandRead moreSimon Lewis, a professor of Global Change Science at University College London, said it was dangerous to treat trees as \u201cnothing more than sticks of carbon\u201d.\u201cOf course, plantations are needed for the paper and wood products society needs, but rebadging industrial plantations as carbon offsets is yet another problem of the \u2026 unregulated carbon offsets market. Tree-planting should not be seen as an alternative to rapidly cutting fossil fuel emissions,\u201d he said.Thomas Crowther, a professor of ecology at ETH Zurich, who co-authored a paper that found there are 900m hectares (2.2bn acres) of land outside urban and agricultural areas suitable for forests, said placing the carbon value of an ecosystem above everything else was wrong.\u201cWhenever we value one part of nature more than everything else, we incentivise the propagation of that part at the expense of everything else,\u201d he said. \u201cHistorically, we have valued the parts that we use for food, timber, medicines etc, but now we are doing the same thing with carbon.\u201d\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X (formerly known as Twitter) for all the latest news and features\n",

But its requested cleanup budget increased just $400m over the same period, according to the new report by Environmental Working Group (EWG), a non-profit that tracks the military\u2019s PFAS pollution.US agency takes unprecedented action to tackle PFAS water pollutionRead moreAt this pace, many of the sites will remain tainted for at least 50 years.\u201cThe DoD is facing a ticking cleanup time bomb as funding falls dramatically behind cleanup costs,\u201d said Jared Hayes, a senior policy analyst at EWG. \u201cThe DoD has an obligation to its service members, the families living on bases, and the surrounding communities that have already been contaminated, so they need to clean up their mess.\u201dPFAS are a class of about 15,000 chemicals often used to make products resistant to water, stains and heat. The compounds are ubiquitous, and linked at low levels of exposure to cancer, thyroid disease, kidney dysfunction, birth defects, autoimmune disease and other serious health problems. They are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally degrade.PFAS are thought to be contaminating drinking water for more than 200 million Americans, and military bases are a major source of pollution because the DoD has used firefighting foam that contains high levels of the chemicals during training and emergencies. The military previously \u201cdownplayed\u201d the number of service members exposed to the chemicals, EWG found, which the group estimated in the millions over recent decades.The level of contamination at the many polluted bases is staggering: as high as 20.7m parts per trillion (ppt) for one PFAS compound in England, Louisiana. The EPA has recommended drinking water limits of four ppt for some PFAS compounds.The military\u2019s cleanup cost estimate is also based on 50 sites it says are contaminated, but EWG identified over 700 sites that are probably polluted, and the true cost is probably tens of billions of dollars more than the $31bn figure.US military \u2018downplayed\u2019 the number of soldiers exposed to \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 Read moreIn some cases, service members and their families have begun fighting back. Those who for decades drank contaminated water at New Hampshire\u2019s Pease air force base are in the process of linking their exposure to extremely high cancer rates at the base, and demanding the military cover their healthcare costs.The pollution also puts civilians around the bases at risk. Initial data from congressionally mandated analysis of water around 700 military installations showed \u201cshockingly high\u201d levels at each of 12 tested by mid-2022.The costs continue growing as the DoD delays because PFAS plumes spread further into the groundwater, which pollutes more private wells and public drinking water systems, Hayes said. That could make the challenge nearly impossible to overcome.\u201cOur analysis clearly shows the DoD at current levels cannot possibly catch up with rising cleanup obligations,\u201d he added.The military last year missed a deadline to submit a cleanup plan to Congress, but new political leadership in the Pentagon and the Biden administration\u2019s moves to rein in pollution have generated at least some optimism.The DoD also recently suggested it may ask for $7bn for fiscal year 2024, but history is keeping hope in check: Congress previously tried to kickstart the remediation process by budgeting $2.5bn after the military requested $1.3bn, but the DoD is still asking for less for the next round of funding.\u201cThe crisis is getting worse, not better and the federal efforts are not keeping pace,\u201d said John Reeder, vice-president of federal affairs with EWG. \u201cThe problem demands urgency \u2026 but instead of urgency, the DoD has consistently requested less funds for cleanup than Congress provided.\u201d",

        "text": "Gail Bradbrook, co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, has been found guilty of criminal damage, after she broke a window at the Department for Transport in an ecologically motivated protest against HS2 in 2019.The timing of Bradbrook\u2019s verdict is almost exquisitely ironic. Five years ago last week, Extinction Rebellion was launched in Parliament Square. Back then, a principal term of criticism lobbied at XR was that it was \u201calarmist\u201d. Five years on, it\u2019s plainly visible that it was not.In the past few months the process of climatic decline has dramatically accelerated, and we are exceeding many of the supposed worst-case scenarios laid out in climate models. We are plainly hurtling towards 1.5C of global over-heat, long before most seemingly well-informed people thought we would.And yet despite this, our climate protest movement in the UK today is nowhere near strong enough to force a change of course. XR\u2019s \u201cscare-mongering\u201d over the existential threat facing us may have been decisively vindicated, but it was never able to recover its reputation from the Canning Town incident in October 2019, when rebels inexplicably stopped underground trains running \u2013 to much public criticism. Since then, it has struggled to assert itself as a credible vehicle for truly mass mobilisation.Many significant organisations and movements have emerged in its wake. The most attention-grabbing have been from the recent, even more radical flank of the UK\u2019s climate movement \u2013 first Insulate Britain and then Just Stop Oil \u2013 who have blocked the M25, stopped test matches and much more. To me, these activists are obviously on the right side of history. But at the same time, many in the broader climate movement now feel that action that disrupts the general public has become counterproductive \u2013 as XR came to learn. Citizens already feel the alarm has been raised. Right now, they don\u2019t need further reminders: they need a journey into positive, effective action that they feel includes them.I moved on from XR in 2020, judging it likely that it had achieved most of what it was capable of achieving (a huge raising of climate consciousness \u2013 not to mention a parliamentary declaration of climate and environment emergency, a net zero law, and a parliament-backed citizens\u2019 assembly on climate).But what is now plainly obvious is that the most important achievement of XR may turn out to be the space it opened up for a new, moderate flank in the climate movement to emerge.XR successfully dragged the whole eco-agenda into the light of day, and this has made it both necessary and possible for a wave of novel organisations and initiatives to fill the vacuum; groups such as Wild Card, Community Climate Action, Lawyers for Net Zero, Purpose Disruptors and Zero Hour. Indeed, many of the successes of historical movements that inspired XR (the Suffragettes, for instance) followed a similar pattern: an agenda-shift prompted by radical-flank initiatives paving the way for actual political success by more moderate agents of change.What has become abundantly clear since XR launched is that, in order to make any real impact on the desperate situation we are slipping into, movements must now unite people in campaigns that they can actually get on board with. That means acting with others where they live, or work or pray \u2013 and within the law.XR itself knows this is the way forward, and seems to have learned from past mistakes. As of 2023, it will no longer disrupt the public. XR\u2019s new strategy, optimistically titled \u201cHere comes everyone\u201d, plans to build on the clearest success of the movement so far. In April, it mobilised about 60,000 people \u2013 considerably more than at any previous moment in its history \u2013 in a peaceful march on the climate crisis. But it will be a long road ahead for XR from here; it will be hard work to fully detoxify its brand. The best prospect for a huge XR resurgence lies in the possibility that the coming climate disasters may help to grow and rejuvenate its ranks.Those of us who stood up and were counted at the launch of XR can be justly proud. But of course, it\u2019s not as if XR\u2019s main objectives were actually achieved (XR\u2019s second demand was for carbon net-zero by 2025). If there is to be any chance of achieving a transformative adaptation to the self-imposed threat of ecological collapse, it\u2019s going to require not just a minority, but most of us, to step up.In decades to come, the only question our children will have any real interest in is: now that it\u2019s becoming clearer what can effectively achieve change, how will you act? And once you knew, what did you do?\nRupert Read is the author of Extinction Rebellion: Insights from the Inside and Co-Director of the Climate Majority Project\n",

It also will not solve grid bottlenecks holding back new solar and windfarms in the state.The Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo), which first proposed VNI West as a $2.7bn project in 2018 and is Victoria\u2019s main planner for transmission, estimated users\u2019 transmission charges would need to rise by a quarter. That assessment, though, was based on 2021 prices and ignored interest costs that have since soared.Victoria announces ban on gas connections to new homes from January 2024Read moreThe report estimates the Victorian portion of the line alone will cost $4.9bn in current dollars.

The onus was also on the agency to demonstrate how the VNI West plan squared with Victoria\u2019s target of sourcing 95% of its electricity from renewables by 2035.VNI West, too, implied Victoria would need to rely on New South Wales for much of its electricity even though its northern neighbour was potentially in an even more precarious power position as ageing coal plants exit the grid, Mountain said.",

        "text": "Rishi Sunak faces \u201celectoral carnage\u201d if the government rejects its climate advisers\u2019 recommendations on halting airport expansion, a coalition of community groups have warned.The prospect of a renewed political battle around airport growth in various parts of England has been reignited amid concern from campaigners at suggestions the government could reject the Climate Change Committee\u2019s (CCC) advice that all such expansions must be halted.While such a move would lead to clashes in the courts, groups such as Communities Against Gatwick Noise and Emissions (CAGNE) warned the Tories would lose more support in \u201cblue wall\u201d constituencies than they stood to gain from any pivot away from green policies.Greenpeace also said it was confident that ignoring the CCC\u2019s advice would make it easier to challenge airport expansion plans in the courts.The government is preparing to reject the CCC finding that there should be no further airport expansions in Britain until a \u201ccapacity management framework\u201d for aviation was developed, the Sunday Telegraph claimed. The prime minister is facing pressure from emboldened backbenchers eager to press home the case for airport growth to boost the UK economy.A Department for Transport spokesperson said on Sunday: \u201cAirport growth, and the aviation sector as a whole, has a key role to play in boosting our global connectivity and helping grow the economy. We remain supportive of airport expansion where it can be delivered in a sustainable way.\u201dBut while hostility to London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone might have been key to the Tories winning the recent Uxbridge byelection, the party was warned that a temptation to sacrifice climate policies on other fronts would cause a backlash.\u201cRather than Uxbridge, they should be looking at what happened in the local elections recently where you saw a surge in Tory councillors losing their seats and being replaced by Lib Dems, Greens and others as a result of very real concerns about the climate crisis,\u201d said Sally Pavey of CAGNE, who added that MPs in corresponding Westminster seats should be \u201cvery nervous\u201d.Tory-held seats where airport expansion could be a factor among some voters include East Surrey, where a majority of just over 24,000 is being defended by Claire Coutinho, who was appointed by Sunak last week as the new energy secretary.Coutinho, whose constituency is also home to airport workers, is in a potentially difficult position, as is another minister, Jeremy Quin, whose Horsham constituency also faces what campaigners say will be more noise pollution and congestion, with a negative effect on amenities.Both ministers were among MPs who wrote to Gatwick in June to ask for a delay in its submission to the government\u2019s Planning Inspectorate on a new \u201cnorthern runway\u201d until further detailed analysis had been provided to local councils.Legal challenges have already failed against plans to expand airports in the Bristol and Southampton areas. Expansion projects are also under way at Heathrow and London City.Gatwick formally submitted plans in June for a \u00a32.2bn second runway, as the airport looks to double its passenger numbers to 75 million a year. The airport said the planned runway would generate 14,000 jobs and bring a \u00a31bn annual boost to the region.Paul Morozzo, a transport campaigner at Greenpeace, said: \u201cThe CCC\u2019s latest advice, which the government must take into consideration in their decision-making, makes it far more difficult for them to give consent to any airport expansion plans in the UK. And, of course, if they ignore the law and make decisions without following due process, then their decisions are much easier to challenge in the courts.\u201d",

But while the agricultural country of 5 million\u2019s share of global greenhouse gas emissions is small, its gross emissions per capita are high and it has been one of the world\u2019s worst performers on emission increases.Emissions in New Zealand rose 57% between 1990 and 2018 \u2013 the second-greatest increase of all industrialised countries.Chris Hipkins, who replaced Ardern as prime minister in January, has also rolled back a raft of climate change policies as he focuses on \u201cbread and butter issues\u201d ahead of October\u2019s general election.Cattle on shore of Lake Wakatipu, New Zealand.

Photograph: David Clapp/Getty ImagesThe commission\u2019s establishment under a cross-partisan agreement in New Zealand\u2019s parliament in 2019 means that the government must, by law, consider its recommendations on climate policy direction, no matter which party is in power. The commission\u2019s latest advice will guide what initiatives are chosen to achieve New Zealand\u2019s 2026-2030 emissions targets.\u201cWe need to pick up the pace and policy needs to be aligned with the statutory targets \u2026 that have already been put in place,\u201d Carr said. The document was not an assessment of the government\u2019s emission reduction efforts to date, which will be published in 2024, he added.The law governing New Zealand\u2019s greenhouse gas reduction targets does not limit how much carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere through planting trees can be relied upon to declare success in slashing emissions.\u201cA lack of clarity on the approach to achieve net zero \u2026 emissions by 2050 and beyond is likely to create ongoing policy uncertainty and impact decision-making in the public and private sectors,\u201d the report said.Is driving on the left stopping New Zealand reaching its climate goals? | Henry CookeRead moreAny delay in beginning the work of true emissions reduction would make the transition to a lower-carbon economy more costly and disruptive, Carr said, and achieving a net reduction in emissions primarily through planting trees would be impossible to sustain in the long term. Forests could be destroyed though fire or extreme weather and they do not store carbon forever, he added.Every time a tree was planted to offset pollution, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re committing New Zealanders to maintaining that forest cover for a very long time.\u201dThe government\u2019s first emissions reduction plan pledged subsidies for electric vehicles; New Zealand has one of the oldest and dirtiest transport fleets in the developed world and the government plans to make zero-emissions vehicles 30% of the light vehicle fleet by 2035. It also vowed to end the country\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels, lower agricultural emissions, and reduce waste going to landfill.The commission is now seeking public consultation on its latest advice and will issue final guidance later this year.",

The petrochemical industry, some governments and many environmental groups have pushed for improvements to the recyclability of plastic.Though some types of the material can be recycled, most cannot, and the study highlights how improving recyclability of the material comes with risks: it identified 853 chemicals used in PET recycled plastic and many of those have been discovered during the last two years.The most commonly detected were antimony and acetaldehyde, while potent toxins like 2,4-DTBP, ethylene glycol, lead, terephthalic acid, bisphenol and cyclic PET oligomers were also most frequently found.Moreover, the chemistries of plastics can be something of a black box. In the US, there\u2019s very little regulation around what goes in the material and the EU only requires light testing to determine which chemicals are in plastic.The study characterizes plastics as \u201cvery complex materials containing hundreds of different, synthetic compounds which are more often than not poorly characterized for their hazard properties\u201d. Some chemicals found in recycled plastics cannot be identified, the analysis notes, adding to the risk of repeatedly recycling and accumulation.... As the quality of recycled plastic decreases, the amount of potential contaminants goes upBirgit Geueke\u201cIt\u2019s not safe, and as the quality of recycled plastic decreases, the amount of potential contaminants goes up,\u201d said Birgit Geueke, the study\u2019s lead author and senior scientific officer with the Zurich-based Food Packaging Forum.The data indicates chemicals are added or created during the recycling process. While 461 kinds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were detected in virgin plastic, some 573 were found in recycled material. Geueke said it was difficult to say why that occurred, but it could stem from the addition of chemicals during the recycling process, the addition of chemicals from the contaminated recycling stream, reactions among chemicals, or from plastic taking up additional chemicals when used the first time.The review also highlighted widespread \u201cillicit\u201d recycling in which industry uses non-food grade plastic made with flame retardants and other toxic compounds in recycled food packaging. Despite strict regulations on which types of plastic can be used for food contact, studies identified recycled electronics in the US, South Korea and European markets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Businesses can now assess their impacts on nature loss using science-based targets as part of a move to \u201cget nature into the boardroom\u201d.Research shows that the biodiversity crisis is as serious as the climate crisis, yet there is less information about how companies drive nature loss, because this data is not being disclosed. The Science-Based Targets Network (SBTN) is providing the first framework for companies to report their impacts on nature as part a new frontier of corporate environmental reporting.SBTN is releasing guidance for companies measuring how they contribute to land degradation, and the use and pollution of freshwater. Companies can then work out what impacts they should focus on reducing and what targets they can set to achieve that. Reporting systems for oceans and species abundance are still being worked on and are to be released in the coming year.Already, more than 2,600 companies report on their carbon emissions using science-based targets, and the new framework is part of a move to make business take account of nature in the same way. Erin Billman, executive director of SBTN, said: \u201cWe are in the midst of interconnected crises. We cannot limit global warming to 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels] without addressing nature loss, and we cannot halt and reverse nature loss without a stable climate.\u201dThe UN says businesses should assess and disclose their impacts on nature by 2030, and the idea of the SBTN is to ensure that there is consensus on how companies do that. Billman said: \u201cIt\u2019s moving nature into the boardroom \u2026 there is enough information for companies to be able to assess and prioritise where to take action.\u201dAs part of the pilot release, 17 companies, including H&M, Kering, Nestl\u00e9 and Tesco, will submit data on their impacts on nature by the end of the year. Those targets will be validated as in line with science-based targets from early 2024. Other companies can also submit data starting now, with validation starting next year.SBTN will validate targets if they align with the overarching UN aim of halting and reversing nature loss by 2030. Only once its targets have been validated can a company can say it has set science-based targets for nature.According to Sophus zu Ermgassen, an ecological economist from the University of Oxford, developing a protocol for companies to set targets to reduce their impacts on nature could represent progress.He said: \u201cUntil companies start setting targets and reporting their progress towards those targets publicly, the public will not be able to hold the largest companies to account for their impacts on biodiversity \u2026 But the devil is in the detail, especially regarding what happens if companies fail to meet their objectives.\u201dZu Ermgassen argues that voluntary disclosures from companies are no substitute for strong state action to stop investment in environmentally damaging activity. He said: \u201cWe can\u2019t rely on voluntary reporting alone to change the ecological impacts of the economy or fundamentally reduce the impacts of firms\u2019 business models without a regulatory environment that incentivises doing the right thing for nature and not profiting from its degradation.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Disclosing impacts on nature is much more complicated than reporting climate impacts, which have one set of metrics \u2013 greenhouse gas emissions. Biodiversity is based on a number of different metrics and data sources, which not even ecologists can agree on.Companies will have different impacts and targets depending on the nature of their business, so there is no one overarching nature target, as there is for climate. There will be separate targets for freshwater use, pollution, land use change, climate change, and so on.The framework is a work in progress and is not expected to be completed until 2025. More than 100 companies have been involved in developing the methods and guidance. SBTN is providing companies with guidance on how to set science-based targets and is working alongside the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures, which is creating a framework for companies to manage and disclose their impacts. Both frameworks are still in development.",

        "text": "Business and cycling groups have urged the government to reform its cycle to work scheme so it can be used by lower-paid and self-employed workers, arguing they are often the people who need it the most.Introduced more than 20 years ago and since used by more than a million people, the scheme allows users to pay for a bicycle and accessories in instalments taken from their salary on a tax-free basis, thus saving them between 25% and 40%.But longstanding rules mean it is not available to people earning minimum wage, or close to it, or who do not pay tax on a pay-as-you-earn salaried basis.In a letter being sent on Monday to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, groups including the Federation of Small Businesses, the Co-op and British Cycling, have called for this to be changed, arguing that amid rising prices those on lower incomes are most in need of the chance to save money on travel.\u201cThe least well paid in our communities are feeling the effects of soaring inflation to a greater extent than those on higher wages, with the rising cost of commuting only adding to their concern,\u201d the letter says.\u201cThey often have no option to do their job from home and are forced to commute to a place of work. The cycle to work scheme has the potential to open up equitable access to cycling and provide a cost-effective solution for many workers within this group. The scheme is a proven mechanism at getting more people cycling, and we believe those on the lowest incomes should benefit too.\u201dPeople who are self-employed represented more than 13% of the UK labour market, the letter added, a proportion that was expected to grow, and were also unfairly excluded, it added.Data collected by the Cycle to Work Alliance, made up of the five biggest bike providers under the scheme, including Halfords and Evans Cycles, shows it has become more in demand because of changing travel patterns during the Covid crisis, especially for key workers.At the peak of the pandemic, from March to September 2020, alliance members recorded a 60% rise in people using the scheme against the same period in 2019, with even steeper increases for staff from the London ambulance service and Metropolitan police.Expanding the scope of the scheme would help deliver the government\u2019s commitment to get more people cycling, the letter argued, and to prevent post-Covid travel patterns from becoming more car-dominated.Currently, the scheme does not allow people to sign up if the contributions from their salary for the bike would take them below the minimum wage, even if a switch to bike commuting might still mean a net saving.The alliance has pledged that if the change was made, retailers would ensure applicants had properly calculated the cost, and were told if their net salary would now be below the minimum wage.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on theguardian..

This would make the incentives for using a salary sacrifice scheme more equitable for all of our colleagues and increase take-up of our cycle to work scheme.\u201dThe Treasury was contacted for comment.",

In the Tigris-Euphrates basin, which covers large parts of Syria and Iraq, droughts of this severity happened about once every 250 years before global heating \u2013 now they are expected once a decade.In Iran, extreme drought occurred once every 80 years in the past but now strikes every five years on average in today\u2019s hotter world. Further global heating, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, will make these droughts even more common.The study also found that existing vulnerability from years of war and political instability had reduced people\u2019s ability to cope with the drought, turning it into a humanitarian disaster.The researchers said it was vital to plan for more frequent droughts in the future.\u201cOur study has shown that human-caused climate change is already making life considerably harder for tens of millions of people in west Asia,\u201d said Prof Mohammad Rahimi, at Semnan University, Iran. \u201cAnd with further warming, Syria, Iraq and Iran will become even harsher places to live.\u201dA person walks amid drought and low water levels in the Euphrates River, in Tabqa, Syria.

If the world does not agree to phase out fossil fuels at [UN climate summit] Cop28, everyone loses: more people will suffer from water shortages, more farmers will be displaced and many people will pay more for food at supermarkets.\u201dFlash droughts are likely to become increasingly common, say researchersRead moreThe Guardian revealed in 2022 how hundreds of scientific studies now show that human-caused global heating is driving more frequent and deadly disasters across the planet. Leading climate scientists warned in August that the \u201ccrazy\u201d extreme weather of 2023 was just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d compared with the even worse impacts to come.The study was conducted by the World Weather Attribution group. The researchers used weather data and climate models to compare how droughts have changed in the region since global heating has pushed up temperatures by about 1.2C.The scientists found that the high temperatures recorded since 2020 were \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d without climate change and made the drought far more likely to happen. The searing temperatures increased the evaporation of the little rain that fell, resulting in the drought being classified as \u201cextreme\u201d on the US Drought Monitor scale. Without the climate crisis, the past three years would not have passed any threshold for drought.The affects of the drought have been wide-ranging, causing millions to flee rural areas, soaring food prices, wildfires and air pollution and fishing rivers and lakes to dry up.In Syria, 2 million rural people have been displaced and 12 million people \u2013 60% of the population \u2013 were reportedly experiencing food insecurity. Almost every province of Iran has been severely affected by the drought and poor harvests have caused spikes in food prices.Otto said: \u201cThe threat of drought is rapidly increasing in a warming world, destroying livelihoods and disrupting global food systems.\u201cWhile countries made extremely wealthy by fossil fuels can pay for adaptive measures to enjoy a comfortable standard of living in a hotter, harsher world, poorer countries reeling in the aftermath of war, cannot,. This is also true for poorer people in rich societies, highlighting again how the continued burning of fossil fuels increases inequality.\u201d",

They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because most do not degrade in the environment.Peer identified over 10,300 PFAS waste shipments between June 2018 and June 2023. The most common disposal methods were incineration, landfilling, discharge into wastewater treatment systems, and deep well injection.Facilities disposing of the largest amounts of PFAS waste included a US Ecology plant in Nevada, a deep-well injection site near Houston, and an incinerator in East Liverpool, Ohio, just upwind from East Palestine, the site of a toxic Norfolk Southern train derailment in February.But there are problems with each method. Deep well injection involves sending the chemicals into the Earth\u2019s crust, and that process, as well as landfilling, have been found to leak PFAS into nearby drinking water supplies. Incineration may only partially destroy PFAS, and can widely disperses them through the atmosphere. When the chemicals land, they can contaminate water, soil and crops.\u201cThere is no known way to safely dispose of PFAS and that\u2019s the problem,\u201d Whitehouse said.The PFAS\u2019s source varies because the chemicals are so widely used, but firefighting foam employed by the military, airports and other industrial users accounts for about 40m pounds of the recorded waste.

Berkley and AIG.With floods, hurricanes, wildfires and droughts increasing in frequency and severity, insurance payouts for natural catastrophes have jumped to an average $110bn a year since 2017, more than twice the average over the previous five years, according to industry figures from Swiss Re.Despite this, Insure Our Future said most insurers continued to support projects to boost oil and gas production, even though they were incompatible with the 1.5C Paris climate target.Peter Bosshard, global coordinator of the campaign, said: \u201cMost insurance companies continue to ensure new oil and gas projects \u2013 pipelines, [liquefied natural gas] terminals and gas-fired power plants \u2013 which will lock in demand for decades to come \u2013 at a time when the climate crisis is escalating and when insurance companies are withdrawing from many regions because they consider the climate risks too high.\u201dSome companies have stopped insuring homes in California, Florida and Louisiana, and in parts of Australia, leaving homeowners highly vulnerable and with significantly reduced property values.The report found that restrictions on oil and gas are far weaker than on coal. New coal power projects are becoming \u201ceffectively uninsurable\u201d outside China because so many insurers have ruled out support.The UK\u2019s Aviva and Italy\u2019s Generali have put the strongest limits on oil and gas insurance, and along with the German insurers Allianz, Hannover Re, Talanx and Munich Re, have ceased insuring new oil and gas extraction without major exceptions.However, none of the 30 insurers ranked in the report have ended cover for new gas power plants, and almost none have ended support for a wave of new LNG terminals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When guests arrive at Silo, a \u201czero-waste\u201d restaurant in east London, next month they\u2019ll be treated to a series of dishes from an unlikely source. It is more famous as the scourge of homeowners, but for some, the solution to the Japanese knotweed crisis is to serve it for dinner.Eating invasive species \u2013 called \u201cinvasivorism\u201d \u2013 is increasingly fashionable as people search for ethical diets. In London, at The Ninth in Fitzrovia, three-cornered leek, a milder version of wild garlic, has been whipped into aioli, while at Native in Mayfair it is used alongside asparagus. At Seasonality in Maidenhead you can tuck into muntjac deer tartare, while Edinburgh\u2019s The Palmerston uses sika deer extensively.Also in Edinburgh, chef Paul Wedgwood of Wedgwood the Restaurant has had squirrel on the menu since 2008, most famously in squirrel haggis. \u201cIt\u2019s mellow, nutty and a bit gamey, and can be substituted for rabbit,\u201d says Wedgwood, who occasionally uses Japanese knotweed and three-cornered leek.Silo is to hold a series of dinners this summer to highlight the issue. Douglas McMaster, the owner and chef of the Hackney Wick restaurant, cut his chops at several Michelin-starred restaurants: London\u2019s St John, Heston Blumenthal\u2019s the Fat Duck and Noma in Copenhagen.The events will feature guest chefs including celebrity chef and campaigner Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who will be challenged to create a menu using Himalayan balsam, and Skye Gyngell of Spring at Somerset House. The first dinner sees chef Matt Orlando, who previously used Japanese knotweed at Amass in Copenhagen, tackling the problematic plant.Japanese knotweed at Silo restaurant in London\u2019s Hackney Wick.

And four of Britain\u2019s deer species \u2013 sika, Chinese water, muntjac and even fallow \u2013 are non-native and a lack of natural predators has allowed their populations \u2013 along with native deer \u2013 to expand exponentially, harming local fauna.\u201cNot only is eating invasive species a solution, but we\u2019re taking pressure off the food system, saving resources,\u201d says McMaster. \u201cJapanese knotweed is incredible, it\u2019s like a mix of asparagus and rhubarb.\u201d At Silo it is on the menu year-round, used in more than 20 menu items, made into pickles and ferments and even used in cocktails. In Japan it is considered a delicacy.Knotweed is incredible. Like a mix of rhubarb and asparagusDouglas McMaster, Silo restaurantYet in the UK it is hated. Introduced in 1839, it spreads voraciously and outcompetes native plants. Where encountered it must be professionally removed, it is routinely sprayed with glyphosate and can even devalue homes.Is eating it the answer? \u201cIf we want to be motivated to remove invasive species, the fact they\u2019re edible is a pretty good motivation for getting involved,\u201d says Fearnley-Whittingstall, whose menu features Himalayan balsam, an invasive weed that grows readily on his property.He insists that the harvesting of the plant be left to experts, as their seeds spread easily. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of pickling them into Himalayan balsam capers, which is something people do with wild garlic seeds.\u201dBut eating invasive species is not without its critics. As with any wild plant, misidentification is a concern. \u201cPeople can become seriously ill from eating plants they misidentify, and often there are edible plants that look very similar to poisonous ones,\u201d says the Royal Horticultural Society. \u201cInstead of eating them we would recommend managing their spread with physical or cultural controls.\u201d And for professional forager Adrian Boots, neither Japanese knotweed nor Himalayan balsam offer much in the flavour department, \u201cthough some will try to convince you otherwise,\u201d he says.McMaster admits to having difficulties encouraging diners to eat jellyfish, and for all the attempts to make squirrel go mainstream \u2013 he has put squirrel kofta and \u201cKentucky fried squirrel\u201d on the menu \u2013 there is probably a reason it hasn\u2019t caught on.McMaster does not envisage Japanese knotweed on supermarket shelves, but sees his role as leading the way in sustainable eating. \u2018There\u2019s a certain amount of resources on this planet, which we\u2019re taking, and we need to restore the balance.\u201d",

It has been hugely controversial among the green wing of the Conservative party \u2013 the former minister Chris Skidmore announced on Friday he would be stepping down as an MP as a result of the proposed legislation.Sharma, the Conservative MP for Reading West who was president of the Cop26 Glasgow climate summit in 2021, rarely rebels against the government, but was heavily critical of the bill.He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI will not be voting for this bill.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat this bill does do is reinforce that unfortunate perception about the UK rowing back from climate action.\u201dHe said: \u201cWe saw this last autumn with the chopping and changing of some policies and actually not being serious about our international commitments. Just a few weeks ago at Cop28 the UK government signed up to transition away from fossil fuels. This bill is actually about doubling down on new oil and gas licences. It is actually the opposite of what we agreed to do internationally, so I won\u2019t be supporting it.\u201dDowning Street on Monday rejected Sharma\u2019s criticisms. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe government believes that it\u2019s common sense to make the most of what we can produce here rather than shipping in from foreign regimes with higher emissions.\u201dMinisters are not expecting a major rebellion on Monday night, although Zac Goldsmith, the Tory peer and former environment minister, urged Conservative MPs to follow Sharma\u2019s example and vote against the bill.He told the Guardian: \u201cConservatives are facing almost certain defeat at the election and so now is not the time for colleagues to be slavishly obedient to a leadership that simply will not be there in a matter of months.\u201cThis vote is about something so much more important than the average vote, and members will not be able to sanitise their records in the years to come. Some will be ex-MPs, others will cling on, but all of them will want to be able to tell their children and grandchildren that they were on the right side of history. It really is as simple as that.\u201dThe government has claimed that the bill will help energy security and contribute to bringing down energy bills, but Sharma said this was not the case.He said: \u201cThe government has said this bill is about protecting energy security. But the reality is, the oil and gas extracted from the North Sea is owned by private companies \u2013 the government doesn\u2019t get to control who they sell to. And the price of oil and gas is set internationally so it won\u2019t actually lower domestic energy bills either.\u201dGovernment claims over the bill have been criticised by scientists and the independent Climate Change Committee. This weekend, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, was criticised by the head of the CCC over his assurances that the government could still meet its climate targets while allowing companies to extract more oil and gas from the North Sea.Last week, it was revealed that, contrary to claims that the oil would be used in the UK, the government appears to accept that the private companies extracting the oil would sell the vast majority internationally, saying: \u201cIt is not desirable to force private companies to \u2018allocate\u2019 oil and gas produced in the North Sea for domestic use.\u201d The statement was in response to a parliamentary question by the Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle.",

Evidence suggests that particulate matter PM2.5 can contain antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes, which may be transferred between environments and inhaled directly by humans, the authors said.Air pollution is already the single largest environmental risk to public health. Long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with chronic conditions such as heart disease, asthma and lung cancer, reducing life expectancy.Short-term exposure to high pollution levels can cause coughing, wheezing and asthma attacks, and is leading to increased hospital and GP attendances worldwide.Curbing air pollution could help reduce antibiotic resistance, according to the study, the first in-depth global analysis of possible links between the two. It also said that controlling air pollution could greatly reduce deaths and economic costs stemming from antibiotic-resistant infections.The lead author, Prof Hong Chen of Zhejiang University in China, said: \u201cAntibiotic resistance and air pollution are each in their own right among the greatest threats to global health.\u201cUntil now, we didn\u2019t have a clear picture of the possible links between the two, but this work suggests the benefits of controlling air pollution could be twofold: not only will it reduce the harmful effects of poor air quality, it could also play a major role in combatting the rise and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\u201dAlthough air is recognised as being a direct pathway for disseminating antibiotic resistance, there is limited data on the different pathways that antibiotic resistant genes are carried via air pollution.Potential pathways include hospitals, farms and sewage-treatment facilities that emit and spread antibiotic-resistant particles through the air and then across wide distances.Until now, there was limited data on how much influence PM2.5 air pollution \u2013 which is made up of particles 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair \u2013 has on antibiotic resistance globally.Sources of PM2.5 include road traffic, industrial processes and domestic coal and wood burning. Data indicates 7.3 billion people globally are directly exposed to unsafe average annual PM2.5 levels.The authors created an extensive dataset to explore whether PM2.5 was a key factor driving global antibiotic resistance, using data for 116 countries from 2000 to 2018. The data sources included the World Health Organization, European Environment Agency and the World Bank.The findings indicate antibiotic resistance increases with PM2.5, with every 10% rise in air pollution linked with increases in antibiotic resistance of 1.1%.The association has strengthened over time, with changes in PM2.5 levels leading to larger increases in antibiotic resistance in more recent years. The analysis indicates antibiotic resistance resulting from air pollution was linked to an estimated 480,000 premature deaths in 2018.A modelling of possible future scenarios indicates that if there were no changes to current policies on air pollution, by 2050 levels of antibiotic resistance worldwide could increase by 17%. The annual premature death toll linked to antibiotic resistance could rise to about 840,000.The authors acknowledged limitations to their study. A lack of data in some countries may have affected the overall analysis, they said.The study was observational, so could not prove cause and effect. Future research should focus on investigating the underlying mechanism of how air pollution affects antibiotic resistance, they said.A second study published in the journal BMJ Mental Health found that exposure to relatively high levels of air pollution was associated with increased use of community mental health services by people with dementia. The long-term study focused on a large area of London with heavy traffic.",

An enormous clump of seaweed circulating the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic is set to coat beaches in a spongy goop, bringing with it a pungent odor similar to rotting eggs.The creeping threat of the Great Atlantic Sargassum BeltRead moreThe huge mass of sargassum is the latest in a series of massive blooms scientists have noticed in the Atlantic since 2011 but could be the largest yet. It is pushing west through the Caribbean and beaches in Canc\u00fan, Mexico, and Key West, Florida, have already seen large mats wash ashore.The brown morass has doubled in size every month from November to January, forming a belt wider than the continental US. It is expected to hit beaches elsewhere in Florida and along the Gulf of Mexico this summer, potentially causing problems for tourists.The seaweed is a floating type of algae that has berry-like bubbles filled with oxygen that keep it buoyant. When it reaches shore, it decays in the sun and releases hydrogen sulfide, which smells like rotten eggs and can aggravate respiratory problems such as asthma.\u201cIt smells very bad and chases away tourists,\u201d said Chuanmin Hu, an oceanographer at the University of South Florida who tracks the sargassum blooms via satellite.Sargassum has always naturally formed in the Atlantic and, out at sea, provides a huge floating habitat for animals such as turtles, birds, crabs and shrimp. Some animals, like the sargassum fish, live their whole lives in the floating brown armada. The seaweed also soaks up carbon dioxide.However, sargassum can pose problems once it has washed ashore and scientists have noticed a large increase over the last decades in the amount now routinely clogging up shorelines in piles five or six feet deep.In Barbados, authorities deploy hundreds of dump trucks to clear the beaches for tourist season. Last year, the US Virgin Islands declared a state of emergency after being inundated by sargassum.\u201cThe low season of the cycle is now higher than the high point of the cycle five or six years ago,\u201d Brian Barnes, a researcher with the University of South Florida\u2019s College of Marine Science, told NPR.\u201cWhat we thought was just a massive bloom has only gotten bigger.\u201dThe exact reason for the monster formations of seaweed is still debated but researchers suspect the seasonal nature of the outgrowths is linked to discharges of pollution from major waterways. Phosphorus and nitrogen, which the algae feed on, are routinely washed into the oceans as runoff from fertilizers used in agriculture.The climate crisis may also be contributing to the problem by causing stronger storms that stir up more seaweed and cause flash flooding that washes pollution into the sea.What is clear, though, is that the big brown blobs appear here to stay.\u201cIt\u2019s only getting bigger and bigger and bigger each year,\u201d Barnes said.",

Naming heatwaves is about letting people know that this is a serious issue.\u201dShould we name heatwaves as we do other extreme weather events?Read moreHe said Spanish cities were developing a \u201cheat culture\u201d where people understood the steps they needed to take to prepare for heatwaves, such as cooling their homes early in the morning and then using shading, doing outdoor tasks outside the hottest parts of the day, staying hydrated and checking on vulnerable community members.Naming heatwaves also created accountability around the actions that communities and government agencies needed to take to protect the public at a time when global heating was increasing the threat, McLeod said.City planners in Spain were also working to reduce the urban heat island effect \u2013 a phenomenon where impermeable hard surfaces like concrete and brick can store and reflect heat, exacerbating temperature extremes.Other steps being taken in Spain include a program to retrofit homes to make them cooler and setting up \u201ccooling centres\u201d alongside health teams during extreme events.\u201cHeatwaves have killed more people in Australia than any other natural hazard,\u201d McLeod said.The Bureau of Meteorology already has a warning system for severe and extreme heatwaves \u2013 defined as periods of at least three days with daytime and night-time temperatures well above what would be expected for a region for that time of year.Heatwaves have already increased in intensity, frequency and duration in Australia, with projections suggesting this trend will continue as the planet continues to warm from the burning of fossil fuels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Researchers have revealed the parrots are able to figure out how to use sets of tools, select the best instrument for a job and even transport tools together before attempting to use them.While New Caledonian crows have long been hailed as expert tool users, recent research shows that Goffin\u2019s cockatoos are also proficient at creating instruments and using them, with one study describing how wild birds manufactured and used three types of tools as \u201ccutlery\u201d to extract seeds from tropical fruit.Besides Goffin\u2019s cockatoos, researchers say the only other non-human species known to use toolsets in the wild are chimpanzees.But Dr Antonio Osuna-Mascar\u00f3, the first author of the research from the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, said it was previously unclear whether the birds were only turning to a second tool once the first proved to be no longer useful.\u201cSomething that looks like a toolset can be nothing more than a chain of single tool uses,\u201d he said, noting there had previously been similar debate around tool set use in chimpanzees.Now, it seems, the question has been settled. \u201cA toolset for a cockatoo is more than the sum of its parts,\u201d said Osuna-Mascar\u00f3.00:00:39Goffin's cockatoo uses two different tools to access cashew nut \u2013 videoWriting in the journal Current Biology, Osuna-Mascar\u00f3 and colleagues describe how they presented each bird with a box containing a cashew nut that could only be accessed using two different tools: a rigid stick to pierce and tear a membrane between a window and the nut, and a longer, flexible tool to fish the nut out.Of the 10 cockatoos presented with the task, seven figured out the need to use both tools, with two solving the task on their first trial.Six birds completed nine consecutive successful trials across three consecutive days, five of which moved on to a second experiment in which the birds were presented at random with a box requiring either one or two tools to access a nut inside. Crucially, while both tools were available, the first tool required depended on the box.The results revealed that in 128 out of 150 attempts in total, the birds used the correct tool first.The team says the findings provide the first controlled evidence that most Goffin\u2019s cockatoos spontaneously begin to use a novel toolset, without help from others, and learned to apply it as needed for the task in front of them.In a final experiment, the five birds were again presented at random with one of the two boxes.

Indeed, current EU legislation already enables them to do so.\u201dIt is a subject close to Von der Leyen\u2019s heart after her pony, Dolly, was killed last September by a wolf that broke into a well-guarded compound in north-west Germany.Complaints about wolves have been growing, with some farmers\u2019 organisations calling for the right to shoot them.A consultation process is designed to balance the interests of rewilding with commercial agriculture and public health concerns.The commission is inviting all interested parties to submit data on the experiences of member states, and is seeking to update data on the wolf population as well as how the conservation status works in practice.\u201cThe return of the wolf to EU regions where it has been absent for a long time is increasingly leading to conflicts with local farming and hunting communities, especially where measures to prevent attacks on livestock are not widely implemented,\u201d the commission said.Wolves are a protected species under conservation laws but farmers have complained that the numbers have increased so much they no longer need such protections.They want the commission to revise the habitats directive to reflect the increased numbers of wolves, particularly in alpine and forested regions of Scandinavia and central Europe.Environmentalists have argued that instead of changing the laws to allow wolves to be culled, farmers can take preventive measures with electric fencing.The farmers\u2019 association Copa-Cogeca estimated wolf numbers increased from just over 12,000 in 2013 to as many as 18,000 last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In total, the grey wolf population in Europe is estimated to be at least 17,000 animals (excluding European Russia) in 28 countries,\u201d it says on its website.With certain exceptions, including threats to life, the deliberate killing of wolves is illegal under the directive but the commission says it needs to update evidence from the last big data sweep in 2018.The EU already has an infringement proceeding outstanding against Sweden, which culls wolves \u2013 but it has been open for more than 10 years, leading the EU ombudsman to launch an investigation this summer into why it is taking so long.An EU-backed project to improve the coexistence between wolves and farmers ran between 2013 and 2018 with tailormade intervention strategies to protect livestock, including fencing, guard dogs and repellent acoustic devices.The EU will use the fresh data from farmers\u2019 organisations, rewilding experts and national environment departments to come up with a proposal, probably within the next six months.\u201cOn the basis of the data collected, the commission will decide on a proposal to modify, where appropriate, the status of protection of the wolf within the EU and to update the legal framework, to introduce, where necessary, further flexibility, in the light of the evolution of this species,\u201d it said.",

It had shut down all major hydro power stations to protect them from damage, it said.At least 10 people died in Mozambique\u2019s Zambezia province, a provincial delegate from the national institute of disaster risk management, Nelson Ludovico, told public broadcaster Radio Mozambique, adding that the figures were still provisional.The health minister, Armindo Tiago, also said on public radio: \u201cThe situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can\u2019t advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there\u2019s no communications with all the regions.\u201dGuy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for Unicef in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.\u201cWe saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People\u2019s homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,\u201d he said. The wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.Mozambique has seen more than a year\u2019s worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.Malawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and UN agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.Scientists say fossil fuel-driven climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.",

Photograph: Lou Streeting/PR Image\u201cOur search of scientific literature, newspapers, and databases yielded 12 individual records of albino or atypically white platypus dating back to the first record in 1835, and our observation likely represents the only known record of a leucistic platypus.\u201dStreeting hopes the intriguing discovery will remind everyone of the need to protect the treasure trove of native species in the nation\u2019s waterways.\u201cThese environments are not just home to endangered species like the western saw-shelled turtle, but also to other truly unique and extraordinary creatures like this rare white platypus.\u201dHabitat destruction fuels decline in numbersThe Australian Conservation Foundation says platypus numbers are in decline, with the duck-billed, egg-laying, milk-producing yet nippleless peculiarity losing roughly a quarter of its habitat during the past 30 years.Despite the downward trajectory, there\u2019s a lack of good data and only broad estimates of how many are left.In an effort to plug the gaps, the ACF has partnered with the University of NSW\u2019s Centre for Ecosystem Science on a citizen science initiative called the Platy-project.The platypus isn\u2019t an albino because only part of its body is affected by a lack of melanin.It encourages Australians to look for them in local creeks and rivers, and share the details of any sightings.Could platypuses disappear in Australia?The UNSW conservation ecologist Gilad Bino worked on a 2021 national assessment of the conservation status of the platypus and says there\u2019s much uncertainty about how many are left.It could sit anywhere between 50,000 and 300,000.There are no national or state-level monitoring frameworks for the species despite evidence of shrinking populations in places such as greater Melbourne.\u201cThat would be true for all urban areas, but we don\u2019t have the data,\u201d he says.Populations are also in decline in parts of the Murray-Darling river system, and there have been localised extinctions in Brisbane.\u201cIn South Australia, they are pretty much extinct except for an introduced population on Kangaroo Island and even they\u2019ve been impacted by bushfires and drought,\u201d he says.\u201cI don\u2019t think platypuses are going to disappear \u2013 and I hope I\u2019m right \u2013 in the next several decades.

Now, though, with conserving water more important than ever, designers have upped the ante with clever models that double as planters, ornaments and even fountains.The market was ripe for a makeover because \u201cone of the barriers to having a water butt is that it\u2019s got to be in your garden, and we want our gardens to look nice, don\u2019t we?\u201d says Gin Tidridge, a product sustainability manager at the B&Q owner Kingfisher.\u201cOne of our biggest sellers is a very slimline water butt,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is only 100 litres. It\u2019s still a useful volume of water but it\u2019s not too big. When we\u2019re looking at something larger, it\u2019s nice if it looks good.\u201dMany Britons underestimate their daily water usage, with the average person using 142 litres, according to Water UK. The need to use it wisely was hammered home last summer when prolonged dry conditions resulted in a drought being declared across wide swathes of England.The traditional plastic water butts are regarded more as practical rather than aesthetically pleasing.  Photograph: Patrick  Herzberg/Getty Images/iStockphotoAt the time, Sir James Bevan, the boss of the Environment Agency, outlined the measures ordinary people should be taking in and outdoors to avoid severe droughts \u2013 a list that included getting a water butt.\u201cSmall things make a big difference,\u201d he said. \u201cTake showers, not baths. Cram the dishwasher or washing machine and only run it when it\u2019s full. Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth. Outside the house, get a water butt: plants prefer rainwater. Use a watering can, not a hose, and don\u2019t water the grass.\u201dThe message seems to be getting through, with 76% of the 3,000 adults polled by Kingfisher stating that reducing the amount of water they use is important to them.Some have taken action, perhaps spurred on by having a water meter fitted, with the number one change installing a water-efficient toilet (31%), followed by a water butt (26%) and fitting a low-flow showerhead (18%). However, a third (31%) had not taken any water-saving measures in their home, according to the survey.Some gardeners, of course, are not worried about aesthetics, and a 200-litre water container can be had on eBay for as little as \u00a310. If you want to spend more, the selection available from big high street names such as B&Q as well as specialist players such as Water Butts Direct is a world away from the green plastic tubs of old.A ManoMano 168-litre Nature Rain Butt. Photograph: ManoManoThere are slim space-saving models, as well as containers that can be prettified as they incorporate a planter. Some are even shaped like beehives or wooden barrels.\u201cYou can spend as much or as little as you want,\u201d Tidridge says. \u201cThe important thing is to make sure you get a good setup. You need to make sure you can get a watering can underneath the tap, and the easiest way to do that is to have a stand. We sell an awful lot of water butt kits, which include a stand and the diverter, which is the pipe and the plastic bit that attaches to your downpipe.\u201d (B&Q sells a 100-litre butt with stand and diverter for \u00a332.)A 120-litre ManoMano Nature Rain Butt with wood look.

This takes the firm\u2019s full-year dividend to 45.51p, a rise of 4.6%, which is in line with its policy to raise payouts in line with a measure inflation including housing costs, calculated using the rate last November.The total payout amounted to a cost of \u00a3301m to the company. This was in a year when its operations generated \u00a3788m of net cash, more than 15% lower than a year earlier, as inflation pushed its costs higher and its customers used less water than expected.United Utilities said it had had a \u201cchallenging year\u201d which also recorded a fall in both revenue and pre-tax profit, which tumbled by over 40% to \u00a3256m.United Utilities\u2019 dividend increase at a time of falling profits comes just a week after the water industry said it would raise customers\u2019 bills over time to recoup some of its \u00a310bn investment in a sewer modernisation scheme to reduce spills of sewage into England\u2019s waterways.The decision was denounced as \u201cmadness\u201d by Tim Farron, environmental spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats. \u201cUnited Utilities are making a mockery by destroying our precious lakes and rivers with sewage, all while handing out bumper dividends,\u201d he said.\u201cThe system is broken when their execs and shareholders are rewarded with millions of pounds for destroying the environment.\u201dFarron called on ministers to demand answers, adding: \u201cThis \u00a3300m should have been spent on preventing sewage polluting the Lake District and region\u2019s rivers.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Sperm whales live in clans with distinctive cultures, much like those of humans, a study has found.Using underwater microphones and drone surveys, Hal Whitehead, a sperm whale scientist at Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Canada, examined the sounds the animals made and their feeding habits and found they organised themselves into groups of up to around 20,000.The paper, published in the Royal Society Open Science journal, said the clans were defined by variations in their vocalisations \u2013 distinctive, morse code-like sequences of clicks known as \u201ccodas\u201d.Acting like human dialects, these enabled Whitehead and his colleagues to establish the existence of seven such clans in the Pacific Ocean \u2013 with a total of 300,000 sperm whales.\u201cThis is a huge number for culturally defined entities outside modern human ethnolinguistic groups,\u201d Whitehead said. The clans might meet but they never interbred, he added. Their sense of identity appeared, in human terms, almost tribal, recognising and maintaining their differences while being of the same species.Sperm whales have the biggest brains on the planet. The animals can reach 15 metres in length, weigh up to 45 tonnes, and are able to dive for up to two hours in search of food, mostly squid. They are present in oceans around the world.Whitehead noted that the clans appeared to be \u201calmost entirely female-based\u201d. Males visited females occasionally and for only a few hours at a time. Their \u201conly important transfer is of sperm\u201d. Designated females undertook \u201calloparental\u201d care, looking out for calves while their mothers dived for food.While underlining how different whales were from humans, the paper suggested intriguing correspondences. Sperm whale society appeared to use consensus, rather than top-down leadership, to reach communal decisions.With thousands of animals travelling at the same time, searching for fast-changing food sources and constantly aware of predators (killer whales will prey on sperm whale calves), these debates can be very important. Whitehead said he had seen whales \u201ctaking up to an hour or more to make a 90-degree turn\u201d as they tried to agree where to go.The democracy of whales was a \u201cslow and messy\u201d business, Whitehead observed, just like our own.He said he believed that studying the evolution of these large populations would give clues to \u201chuman social evolution at the largest scales\u201d in ways that \u201chave few parallels elsewhere\u201d.The study suggested there may be evidence of how human activity had affected the whales. Sperm whales were widely hunted in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. In the 20th century alone, 700,000 died in hunts carried out by Britain, Norway, the Netherlands, Russia, Japan, Canada and Australia, among other nations. Up until 1971, sperm whale oil was used in the automatic transmissions of most American cars.Population numbers have recovered since the 1982 moratorium on the killing of great whales. But as sperm whales can reach up to 80 years in age, it is possible that individuals may retain traumatic memories of 20th-century hunts, the paper suggested.Whitehead told the Guardian that genetics in populations subjected to \u201cintense modern whaling\u201d showed evidence of reduced fertility and fragmented family units. Even the physical size of the animals had reduced.Whitehead, who has been studying sperm whales at sea since 1985, said he liked the term \u201cwhale nations\u201d as a way to express the scale of the separate clans. He looked to human history and prehistory, as a way of understanding the whales\u2019 evolution, comparing a discrete whale clan in a closed area, such as the Mediterranean, to that of the human population on an isolated island, such as Australia.Conversely, in larger areas, such as the Pacific, where two or more clans share the same environment, \u201cculture is the only tenable explanation for the differences between clans\u201d, like a country shared by humans speaking different languages.Whitehead acknowledged that research into the whales\u2019 deeper prehistory \u2013 since the species evolved 24m years ago \u2013 may be as difficult as the study of human prehistory. But he said he believed \u201cpatterns in genetics and linguistics, coupled with measures of environmental change\u201d could reveal \u201can extraordinary amount\u201d.\u201cI suppose one could say that [the whales\u2019] history starts when we humans started writing about them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe prehistory of sperm whales is likely to be fascinating, but will be much harder to picture than for humans.\u201d",

For proof, you need only look to the annual Big Garden Birdwatch, which has shown a catastrophic decline over the past 14 years. And if you look for them in late spring, you\u2019ll see that nightingales, turtle doves and swifts have almost vanished from our skies.The government\u2019s announcement this week of commitments to improve wildlife habitats could provide the platform for nature\u2019s recovery. And the recent \u00a33bn pledged to protect and restore nature, while not enough, demonstrates that the government recognises the scale of the task when it comes to delivering the targets agreed under the Environment Act and the global biodiversity framework set at Cop15. Defra has, on paper at least, attempted to rise to the challenge.We need urgent action to keep common species common and save those already on the brink of being lost. This is not a problem on the horizon, but on our doorsteps. The UK is among the most nature-depleted countries in the world, bottom of the table compared with the rest of the G7.Every household in England \u2018to be within 15 minutes of green space or water\u2019Read moreWe are five years into a 25-year environment plan, but as the recent concerns raised by the National Audit Office and the Office for Environmental Protection reveal, there has been a lack of progress. A plan alone is not enough to drive action.So the publication of today\u2019s more detailed route map to delivery is positive \u2013 but its policies must permeate through all aspects of government. Last year alone we saw approval of the Sizewell C nuclear plant, which will be built on top of one of the UK\u2019s most important wetland nature reserves. And the current levelling up bill shows no sign of legislating for the improvements in nature that are sorely needed in our national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty.Protected areas must be more than lines on a map. We have seen protected areas declared on land and at sea, but without the funding needed to restore, maintain and improve their condition, these spaces won\u2019t reach their potential. We need to have targets applied to our protected areas to ensure they are inspected regularly, so we can build a network of wild spaces that have measurable benefits for species recovery.About 70% of land in England is farmed, and incentivising nature recovery alongside food production via environmental land management schemes (Elms) will not just be a boon for our struggling farmland species but could see much wider benefits in productivity. At our own farms and on the land of the farmers we work with, we have seen how encouraging wildlife can lead to reduced use of pesticides as well as allowing natural pollinators to thrive. The commitment to support landowners who set aside 10-15% of their farmland for nature by 2030 is welcome \u2013 but the plan will need to be much more ambitious to deliver this. Developing nature-based solutions to the climate crisis and protecting land and marine habitats will also be vital.Fishing industry still \u2018bulldozing\u2019 seabed in 90% of UK marine protected areasRead moreAbove all we must see measurable progress by 2030. Not flattening the curve, but progress. This means a fully realised plan for how we will protect 30% of our land and seas, with assurances that these spaces will not just be given a certain status on paper, but will actively work to help nature\u2019s recovery.Meanwhile, Defra, along with every other government department, is struggling to grapple with the scale of the unnecessary task of reviewing and rewriting about 1,800 pieces of environmental legislation due to the retained EU law bill.There is a lot to be hopeful about in the environmental improvement plan, and there is still time to save nature. We know what we have to do. But unfortunately that hope must be tempered by the need to see joined-up, properly funded and urgent action to make this plan a reality.For too long, politicians have been able to offer vague assurances that things will be better in the future. It is now less than seven years until 2030. In all likelihood, many of those same decision-makers will still be in parliament as we enter the next decade.

A record-breaking 40.3C was recorded on 19 July at Coningsby, Lincolnshire.Hottest day of 2022 saw 638 more deaths than normal in EnglandRead moreProf Liz Bentley, the chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, who oversees the journal that published the annual report, said: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen 40C in the UK before \u2026 to break that record I think was a real milestone.\u201cThis was probably the first time we saw a hot, dry summer for a while. If you look at future climate projections, we are on a path [towards] hotter, drier summers. So 2022 was very much a sign of things to come.\u201dA host of other records were set last year. It was warmer than average throughout 2022, except for December, which was the coldest since 2010. Despite this, all four seasons were in the top 10 hottest since records began in 1884. The past decade, from 2013-22, was also the UK\u2019s warmest.2022 monthly mean temperature anomalies relative to 1991\u20132020 baseline, CMet Office studies have found the record heat and the heatwave last July, when the organisation issued its first red warning for extreme temperatures, were made more likely because of human-induced climate breakdown.Mike Kendon, the lead author of the report, said: \u201cThe observations show that extreme temperatures are changing faster than the average and, as our climate warms, we expect far more high temperature records to be broken, potentially by wide margins, and far fewer low temperature records.\u201dPeople watch the sunset from a hill in Ealing, west London, on 11 August 2022, after the Met Office issued an amber warning for extreme heat.

This refers to events such as leaves staying on trees longer or flowers blooming earlier.Fritha West, a phenologist at Woodland Trust, said: \u201cSpecies will react in different ways, and these reactions will impact human life in different ways, but the speed of these changes could cause concern.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

He added: \u201cOur role is to provide the science to government to make the policy decisions that they do. But obviously the science is clear: the longer we take to reduce emissions, the longer and harder it will be to reduce the impacts that we are seeing.\u201d",

Refusing a bonus, while pocketing a fortune in the background, makes for a pretty hollow act of contrition.\u201dShaw joined the chief executives of Thames Water and South West Water in publicly stating on the same day last month that they would refuse their bonuses, amid widespread criticism of water companies\u2019 pollution records.She later said: \u201cI get why people are angry \u2013 seeing sewage in our rivers and seas isn\u2019t right. We should have a system that befits the 21st century. So, on behalf of Yorkshire Water, I am sorry. We should have acted more quickly to change the situation.\u201cThat\u2019s why I have decided to refuse any bonus this year, as I want us to make progress.\u201dHer bonus at Yorkshire Water would have been between \u00a3600,000 and \u00a3800,000, on top of her \u00a3574,000 salary.The company also agreed to pay expenses of \u201cup to \u00a3140,000\u201d for Shaw to relocate to Yorkshire. The company declined to answer questions over how much of this sum she had taken.Shaw was granted \u201cgood leaver\u201d status by National Grid on resigning from her role as executive director \u201cgiven her overall long-term strong performance and contribution to the business\u201d, meaning she was entitled to the share awards.She received a separate share award from the energy company worth about \u00a31.8m last year and picked up \u00a3152,000 in fees and benefits for her role on the board of British Airways owner IAG.Last week, the Guardian reported that Thames Water had been accused of conducting a \u201cflimsy PR stunt\u201d over its chief executive, Sarah Bentley, shunning her bonus, as the company will soon report that she received \u00a3726,000 in extra payments on top of her \u00a3750,000 salary.The daughter of a stockbroker, Shaw worked her way up the transport industry and was chief executive of the \u00a36.2bn High Speed One rail line for five years until 2016. She received a CBE for services to transport in the Queen\u2019s New Year Honours in 2016.

        "text": "Climate impact labels on foods such as red meat are an effective way to get people to stop choosing options that negatively affect the planet, a study has found.Policymakers have been debating how to get people to make less carbon-heavy food choices. In April, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report urged world leaders, especially those in developed countries, to support a transition to sustainable, healthy, low-emissions diets.In the UK, Henry Dimbleby, the government\u2019s food tsar, recently said it was politically impossible for a government to tell people to stop eating as much meat. About 85% of agricultural land in England is used as grazing pasture for animals such as cows or to grow food which is then fed to livestock. Dimbleby believes a 30% meat reduction over 10 years is required for land to be used sustainably in England, while Greenpeace argues for a 70% reduction.The clinical trial, published in the journal Jama Network Open, has found that consumers respond well to climate labelling on their foods.Participants in the study, which used a nationally representative sample of adults in the US, were shown a fast food menu and prompted to select one item they would like to order for dinner. Participants were randomised to view menus with one of three labels: a quick response code label on all items (control group); green low\u2013climate impact label on chicken, fish or vegetarian items (positive framing); or red high\u2013climate impact label on red meat items (negative framing).The low\u2013climate impact condition menu stated: \u201cThis item is environmentally sustainable. It has low greenhouse gas emissions and a low contribution to climate change.\u201d The high\u2013climate impact condition menu said: \u201cThis item is not environmentally sustainable. It has high greenhouse gas emissions and a high contribution to climate change.\u201dCompared with participants in the control group, 23.5% more participants selected a sustainable menu item when menus displayed high\u2013climate impact labels and 9.9% more participants selected a sustainable menu item when menus displayed low\u2013climate impact labels. Across experimental conditions, participants who selected a sustainable item rated their order as healthier than those who selected an unsustainable item, according to a mean perceived healthfulness score.Some may disagree with this labelling; intensively produced chicken has been found to be damaging for the environment, as has some farmed and trawled fish.The study authors, from Johns Hopkins and Harvard universities, said: \u201cAnimal-based food production, primarily driven by beef production, is responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is an important modifiable contributor to climate change.\u201cIn the United States, meat consumption, red meat consumption in particular, consistently exceeds recommended levels based on national dietary guidelines. Shifting current dietary patterns toward more sustainable diets with lower amounts of red meat consumed could reduce diet-related greenhouse gas emissions by up to 55%.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Once my work is done, and as long as the winds aren\u2019t whipping up the valley, I head into Aberystwyth to dip into the sea. Some days I try to swim far; others I lie on my back and watch the clouds. Then I wander up to the Prom Diner and, depending on the time, order a cortado, an ice-cream or, if the day lends itself to it, a beer. I find a seat facing the sea and bask in all of it. This is a very good life.But I cannot stay smug, because the sea has other ideas. Aberystwyth\u2019s beaches, like those of Borth and Aberdyfi to the north, are storm beaches, which move with the sea\u2019s weather and moods. At this time of year, they shift daily \u2013 sometimes even more often. The largely slate shingle beach that holiday folk know from summer is gone and replaced with sand.When I say it has gone, that is not strictly true: the shingle has now breached the sea wall and is mostly on the promenade around the diner, with a smattering found even on the highest parts, around the college and the castle. Within the first week of this happening, the diner boards up its ice-cream hatch. There is another week or so of coffee, then the sea hurls up a little more shingle \u2013 enough for paw and footprints to register. The shingle pools around the planters and the base of the now-closed diner.By Christmas last year, the winter storms had added such a dense layer that the council used a mini-digger to create narrow paths; the shingle piled into mounds that children loved to run up and down. Each day, the sea would throw up new finds for the new beach: a whole trunk of a tree; a boulder so impossibly large that it was hard to fathom how it had been moved, placed in such a pleasing position that people start using it as a seat. Then, just as quickly as it arrived, it was taken back.Each day, the sea would throw up new finds for the new beach: a whole trunk of a tree; an impossibly large boulderAs with all shingle beaches, the sea loves to grade the pebbles, so that down on the \u201cold\u201d beach the largest are gathering by the sea wall. Around them, red seaweeds cluster like feather boas; in the middle, smaller pebbles are surrounded by haloes of sand, making constellations across the vast galaxy of the finest-grade shingle. There is a wonderful Black Country word for the smallest of shingle, bibble, which is smaller than a pebble, but larger than a grain of sand. One day, the sea will take all this, dump it on to the promenade and shape the beach into the smoothest sand.In our first winter here, I couldn\u2019t quite believe this transformation, or the accepting nature of the local people, who shrugged and said that, a week before the return of holidayers in spring, the council would sweep all the shingle back on to the beach, the diner would reopen and no one would be any the wiser.It feels as if I am giving away secrets by telling you all this, but I love this off-duty seaside. All the naysayers told us the winters would be depressing, the stormy seas too entangled with our moods. But I like the change. Before the afternoon is lost to the darkness, I cycle down as many days as I can to say hello to the sea. If she is calm, I dip into her for as long as I can bear. Rarely am I alone: there is always someone just getting into or out of the sea, plus a line of people standing on the shingle prom, watching the starlings murmur against the setting sun. I love this worship to the thing that defines this town. Alys Fowler is a gardener and freelance writer",

        "text": "Britain\u2019s solar industry delivered record levels of renewable electricity to the power grid earlier this year, but as daylight hours stretch longer around the summer solstice, it could be on track to reach another record.Solar power generation in June is on track to come within a hair\u2019s breadth of the record set during an unusually sunny May in 2020 at about 20 gigawatt hours, according to Alastair Buckley, the professor of organic electronics at the University of Sheffield.That is perfect timing for the largest solar power industry gathering of the year, at a summit in London this week, and a chance for many to reflect on the resurgence of sunlight in the grid, in the years since the Conservative government brought the industry to its knees by slashing subsidies. More importantly, it will be a chance to look ahead to a new dawn.The solar industry has been easy to underestimate in a country better known for dull drizzly days than blue skies. But it has enjoyed steady growth, is far cheaper than headline-grabbing nuclear investments and far less conspicuous than fields of wind turbines.Solar power made up 4.4% of the UK\u2019s electricity needs in 2022, but the annual figures belie a far greater impact in the summer. Solar regularly accounts for more than 25% of demand when it is producing peak output during the sunnier months. It has also seen a step change in demand due to falling technology costs and a growing desire for cheap, secure energy supplies.Last year, the number of rooftop installations in the UK doubled, according to MCS, an accreditation scheme. It found that a total of 130,596 systems were mounted on UK rooftops in 2022, the same number as in the three previous years combined.In total, the UK has about 15 gigawatts of solar power capacity across the country, according to the industry body Solar Energy UK. The government hopes to increase this to 70GW by 2035.This ambition is not without challenges. Surging demand has led to one of the longest queues for a grid connection in Europe, with many solar developers being told they will have to wait more than a decade. The outcry over delays, which threaten the UK\u2019s solar aims and legally binding climate targets, underlines the appetite for homegrown solar energy. National Grid, which manages the connections process, has begun an urgent review and hopes to ease the gridlock in the coming years.Worldwide, growth in solar is expected to rocket. The International Energy Agency believes the global energy crisis will give way to a boom in spending on affordable, homegrown renewable energy, with solar likely to emerge as the fastest growing source of renewable electricity. Solar power is set to almost triple between 2022 and 2027, to surpass coal as the biggest source of electricity capacity in the world, it said. This year, investment in solar power is likely to eclipse spending on oil production for the first time, the IEA added.The next week\u2019s weather will determine whether June emerges as the solar industry\u2019s latest record-breaking month. At the UK solar summit, energy executives and investors will determine how best to navigate the technology\u2019s enormous growth potential in the long term. For the industry, it\u2019s a sunny forecast ahead.",

        "text": "Ministers need to start looking seriously at the health risks from vehicle tyre wear as the impact of pollutants from car exhausts gradually reduces, Sir Chris Whitty has told MPs.Giving evidence to the environmental audit committee, England\u2019s chief medical officer said improvements in emissions from petrol and diesel vehicles, and a shift towards electric cars, were reducing the extent of dangerous pollutants such as nitrogen oxides.A complete move to electric vehicles would \u201cessentially eliminate\u201d exhaust pollutants, Whitty said, but this would not solve the parallel problem of particulates from tyre and brake wear, he told the committee.With many electric vehicles featuring \u201cregenerative braking\u201d, which greatly reduces brake friction, this was less of a problem compared with petrol and diesel cars, Whitty added.In contrast, the greater weight of electric vehicles meant the amount of tyre-based particles \u201cmay slightly go up over that period, and we will need to deal with that\u201d.He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think we have really thought about how to reduce air pollution from tyres previously, because it\u2019s been such a small proportion. Now that we\u2019re getting rid of many or all of the tailpipe emissions, I think we need to start looking at these quite seriously.\u201dRecent studies have raised concerns about the danger to health from tiny particles produced by tyre wear, as well as from road surfaces and marking, which are now notably greater than those coming from exhausts.Whitty, who explained to the committee how pollution was linked not just to respiratory problems but also heart disease, strokes and even dementia, said indoor pollution was a significant problem, if one less well understood.Citing air fresheners as a hazard, Whitty said that while he did not think the evidence was strong enough to merit government warnings, he would recommend that families with an asthmatic child avoided using them.On outdoor pollution, he highlighted the problems from sources including wood-burning stoves and diesel trains.On the latter, he said, it was \u201cwholly unnecessary\u201d to have diesel engines running on trains in busy stations, saying these should be adapted to use electric power when in a station.Asked about the potential exposure to pollutants for people who walk and cycle in urban areas, Whitty stressed that the health benefits of active travel greatly outstripped any such risks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Also, fairly obviously, the more we move people \u2026 into active transport, the less [pollution] there will be.\u201dJonathan Grigg, a professor of paediatric respiratory and environmental medicine at Queen Mary University of London, welcomed Whitty\u2019s warning on tyre and brake particles, which can be inhaled deep into the lungs, and also accumulate in the food chain.He said: \u201cSince it is difficult in epidemiological studies to disentangle effects of fossil fuel-derived particles from particles generated from tyres and brakes, the contribution of these non-combustion particles to adverse health effects is unclear. Chris Whitty is therefore correct to say that we urgently need more research in this area, especially laboratory-based studies using cultures of human airway cells.\u201d",

The Wharfe was recently listed as one of the most polluted rivers in England, yet part of it, at Ilkley, is also an official swimming site. For its name to be synonymous with filth is an outrage. Even this stretch in Grassington, miles upstream from the better-known polluted part, is not completely safe. Still, I swim, at my own risk and at least partly in protest. After all, I have a choice whether or not to be in this river, but the life that exists in it does not.A piece of broken china found in the River Wharfe near Grassington.

Bowen said last August that Australian consumers could choose between just eight low-emissions vehicles under $60,000, compared with 26 available in the UK.Impetus has only gathered internationally since then, with the US becoming the latest country to flag much stricter emissions standards. Under proposed changes by the US environment protection agency unveiled this week, the share of electric vehicles in the world\u2019s second-largest car market could soar from about 6% last year to 66% by 2032.\u201cMotor vehicle emissions contribute to ozone, particulate matter and air toxins, which are linked with premature death and other serious health impacts, including respiratory illness, cardiovascular problems, and cancer,\u201d the US EPA said, while explaining the need for the new standards.\nSign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads\n\u201cIn addition, there is consensus that the effects of climate change represent a rapidly growing threat to human health and the environment \u2026 caused by greenhouse gas emissions from human activity, including motor vehicle transportation.\u201dAsked whether Australia could reach EV sales of two out of every three purchases, Bowen said he believed \u201cAustralia can catch up with the rest of the world\u201d.\u201cYou look at the United Kingdom, United States, other countries are way ahead of Australia\u2019s electric vehicle sales,\u201d he said on Thursday.\u201cThat is partly a supply issue because we don\u2019t require low emissions vehicles to be sent to Australia because we don\u2019t have fuel efficiency standards,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cIt\u2019s partly because the previous government talked down electric vehicles.\u201cBattery electric vehicle sales are 2.5 times higher in the first quarter of this year, than [the same time] last year,\u201d he said.The government said it had received more than 500 submissions to the strategy\u2019s consultation paper.

        "text": "Another month of smashed temperature records has left scientists searching for words with which to describe what is happening. \u201cGobsmackingly bananas\u201d was the phrase alighted on by Zeke Hausfather of the Berkeley Earth climate data project. This was the hottest September on record, following the hottest August and the hottest July. It beat the previous September record by 0.5C, the largest jump in temperature ever seen.In the UK, where the summer was wet and many people have enjoyed unseasonably warm early autumn days, the disruption has not been anything like as destructive as elsewhere. But floods, fires and exceptionally high temperatures are becoming more and more frequent \u2013 with the overflow of Lhonak Lake in India, and the wildfires and baking heat in Tenerife among the latest emergencies.The countdown to the latest round of UN climate talks, which start in Dubai in late November, has begun. On Wednesday, Pope Francis issued an update to his 2015 encyclical \u2013 a document he addressed to \u201cevery person living\u201d \u2013 warning that \u201cthe world in which we live is collapsing\u201d and calling for \u201cirresponsible\u201d western lifestyles to change. More than 80 countries are pushing for a phaseout of fossil fuels to be on the Cop28 agenda. But leaders of the biggest-emitting countries, including Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, were absent from a summit convened by Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, in New York last month.As Mr Guterres has warned, oil companies and states are lobbying hard against attempts to close down their businesses. Saudi Arabia\u2019s huge recent investment in football is part of a strategy aimed at increasing its influence and muting opponents. Last year, Saudi Aramco, which is largely state-owned, made a profit of $161bn (\u00a3134bn) \u2013 the biggest ever recorded by an oil and gas firm.The actions of the oil companies and petrostates are one thing. But so far, the actions of governments across the rich world have failed to match their words on net zero. Even now, as scientists admit that they are stunned by the latest data, there is no guarantee that greenhouse gases will stop rising by 2025, as experts believe they must if there is to be any chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C.Under Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s ambitions have slipped. Last month, he watered down commitments on phasing out petrol cars and gas boilers, while ministers at his party\u2019s conference used inflammatory rhetoric to play up public fears that decarbonisation is unaffordable. But other governments too are showing a disturbing lack of engagement. With a recent proposal for a windfall tax on the oil and gas revenues of countries with the largest deposits, the UK\u2019s former prime minister, Gordon Brown, went further than the current leaders of any big western states have done recently. No wonder that the governments of some of the poorest countries, which are most threatened by global heating and have contributed least to the problem, are angry.As Pope Francis said, \u201cwe can keep hoping\u201d. The high temperatures are frightening, but could be used by responsible politicians to build the momentum that is needed for an accelerated green transition. This article was amended on 8 October 2023. Pope Francis\u2019s 2015 encyclical was in fact addressed to \u201cevery person living\u201d, not just Catholics as an earlier version said.",

        "text": "The UK is responsible for almost twice as much global heating as previously thought when its colonial history is taken into account, analysis has revealed.The UK\u2019s domestic emissions account for 3% of total world emissions dating back to 1850. But when responsibility for emissions in countries once under the British empire\u2019s rule is given to the UK, the figure rises to more than 5%.These additional emissions come largely from the destruction of forests in the colonised countries, with the biggest contributors coming from India, Myanmar and Nigeria before their independence.The analysis by Carbon Brief moves up the UK from eighth to fourth in the list of nations with the biggest historical emissions, behind the US, China and Russia.The climate crisis, which has led to temperature records being shattered in 2023, is predominantly the result of carbon emissions from rich nations. However, the worst impacts of intensifying extreme weather are hitting poorer nations, which have very low emissions.The issue of responsibility features strongly in the international UN climate negotiations, which resume again at Cop28 in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday.It is especially important in debate over the provision of climate finance to developing nations. A new \u201closs and damage\u201d fund will be a critical matter of contention at the summit.British empire colonial emissionsDr Simon Evans, at Carbon Brief, said: \u201cOur new analysis offers a thought-provoking fresh perspective on questions of climate justice. It is well known that colonial powers extracted natural resources from colonised lands to support their economic and political power, but the link to historical emissions had never been quantified until now.\u201cOur findings reinforce the significant historical responsibility of developed countries for current warming, particularly the former colonial powers in Europe.\u201cMany of these countries now have declining emissions. Yet their relative wealth today \u2013 and their historical contributions to current warming \u2013 are recognised within the international climate regime as being tied to a responsibility to support the climate response in less developed countries.\u201dHistorical emissions are significant because there is a direct relationship between the amount of carbon dioxide released over time and the level of heating at the Earth\u2019s surface, said Evans.This means even CO2 emissions from 170 years ago continue to contribute to the heating of the planet. The analysis includes emissions from fossil fuels, cement, and the destruction of forests and other natural habitats.The analysis shows other countries such as the Netherlands and France also jump up the ranking of historical responsibility for the climate crisis when their colonial emissions are included. The Netherlands, which colonised Indonesia, rises from 35th to 12th in the ranking, with its cumulative emissions nearly tripling, while the French total rises by 50%.The analysis also calculates national cumulative emissions from 1850 per person, based on today\u2019s population. On this basis, the Netherlands has the highest per capita historical emissions, followed by the UK in second place, among countries with populations of at least 1 million.Colonial emissions graphic\u201cClimate change impacts are responsible for devastating losses and damages in many former British colonial territories,\u201d said Dr Nfamara Dampha, a Gambian scientist at the University of Minnesota, US.\u201cFor example, the Gambia\u2019s capital city Banjul is projected to be completely lost by 2100 if aggressive measures are not undertaken.\u201cRich developed nations, including the UK, agreed to establish the loss and damage fund last year. However, we are heading to Cop28 leaving climate justice or reparation behind.\u201dHe said this was because the likely set-up of the fund \u201cunequivocally fails to hold former colonisers accountable for paying their fair share, based on historical responsibility, equity, and polluter-pays principles\u201d.Zahra Hdidou, at ActionAid UK, said the analysis was \u201cparticularly damning\u201d for the UK: \u201cAs the fourth highest historic carbon emitter in the world, it has an historic responsibility to address climate change, but currently its actions don\u2019t match its words.\u201dShe pointed to the issuing of new oil and gas licences and controversy over the delivery of a promised \u00a311.6bn in climate finance.A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cThis analysis ignores the fact the UK is taking decisive action to cut emissions far faster than any other major economy. The UK currently accounts for only 1% of annual global emissions.\u201cKeeping 1.5C in reach requires us to focus on the future, which is why we\u2019re investing billions to support the transition to net zero and reduce emissions yet further.\u201dThe Carbon Brief analysis used published historical emissions data from 1850 to 2021 and used other data to update the figure to 2023. Information on the history of foreign rule is taken from another published study.The analysis of the UK took into account 46 countries that were once part of the British empire. Emissions from former Soviet republics were ascribed to Russia.",

But some farmers have raised concerns about how the reintroductions could affect their work.The environment secretary told the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU) conference in Birmingham that \u201cfarmers do not need to worry\u201d about species reintroductions and said she would rather focus on species and habitats already in the UK.Coffey said: \u201cI don\u2019t want farmers to constantly have to worry about these issues. We\u2019ve got plenty to do with the habitats that need improving and expanding.\u201dShe added that when there were proposals to release sea eagles in her constituency, \u201cfarmers were really worried about what this would do to their livestock, particularly given the extent of free range farming in that part of the country\u201d. There has been little to no evidence of sea eagles taking livestock, but they do feed on carrion.Coffey summed up: \u201cI won\u2019t be supporting reintroductions of species like lynx and wolves.\u201dCraig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, which has been involved in beaver release trials and is working on a policy around releasing wildcats, strongly criticised her stance.He said: \u201cThis is deeply disappointing, it suggests that sadly the secretary of state is massively out of touch with British public opinion on these issues and in fact the views of many farmers I talk to.\u201dEcosystems need lost species such as beavers to create habitats, and some such as pine martens to act as predators in the food chain, he added. \u201cThe fact is, ecosystems are not functioning as they should but where we have seen the reintroductions of beavers, of pine martens, you start to see these ecosystems are functioning properly.\u201dOn Coffey\u2019s remarks about sea eagles being a threat to farmers, he said: \u201cI think there are many misplaced concerns, I completely understand that whenever we look at species reintroductions there needs to be support among landowners and farmers.

One of the topics under discussion was how to approach rewilding without causing conflict with local people.The government is also expected to allow beavers to be released out of their enclosures across the country, in coming months. In 2021, the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, promised to \u201cbuild back beaver\u201d in his speech to the Conservative conference. However, there was some confusion, after Coffey\u2019s statement, over whether the plans would proceed.A Labour government may support species reintroductions. The shadow environment minister, Alex Sobel, said: \u201cIt is a job for the species introduction taskforce to consider and advise ministers accordingly. There are areas where its inappropriate and equally areas where it will for example help prevent and alleviate flooding.\u201dDuring a question and answer session after her speech, Coffey had a robust exchange with the NFU president, Minette Batters, who said the egg sector was facing \u201cmarket failure\u201d with a loss of a million hens, as well as empty supermarket shelves.

Done with regard to equity, actions in these domains can reduce health inequalities. Clean transport, for example, will reduce air pollution at the same time as it contributes to net zero, with the effect of reducing health inequalities. Without regard to equity, climate-change action could make inequalities worse.\u201dProf Lea Berrang Ford, the head of the Centre for Climate and Health Security at the UKHSA, made it clear that the negative health effects of climate breakdown will not be distributed equally across the UK, social determinants or generations.The report said that children and young people will experience increasingly severe weather into their retirement, with effects persisting or increasing for their children.Ford said: \u201cThe distribution of the impacts of climate change do not just differ across geographic regions, but also across different socio-demographic groups.\u201cClimate change is well recognised as likely to exacerbate existing health inequalities, and across a range of health impacts the most vulnerable groups are adults over 65 years old, children and those with pre-existing medical conditions.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company, one of the world\u2019s largest investors in renewable power, will do so by growing its renewables portfolio with the development of a new onshore windfarm in Scotland, which is due to begin generating electricity from 2026.The estate manager has bought renewable electricity for the business district from energy suppliers since 2012 but the deal with Brookfield is the first time it will source its clean electricity directly from a renewable energy project.The 15-year agreement could be extended to supply all of Canary Wharf\u2019s 18m sq ft of office, retail and leisure spaces with 100% renewable electricity, according to Shobi Khan, the chief executive of Canary Wharf Group.Khan told the Guardian that the deal took three years to agree but should help to reduce electricity bills by about 50% compared with using power generated by gas power plants. The deal is part of a wider campaign to transform the estate into a sustainability leader, he said.\u201cThe point is to not only do something good for the environment but have it make good business sense, too,\u201d Khan added.Brookfield has used its global portfolio of about 25,000 megawatts of renewable energy \u2013 the equivalent of all the UK\u2019s onshore and offshore windfarms combined \u2013 to strike clean energy supply deals with about 700 corporate customers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By most accounts, the sprawling tree was the heart of the oceanside community \u2013 towering more than 60ft (18 meters) and anchored by multiple trunks that span nearly an acre. This year the town celebrated the banyan\u2019s 150th birthday with cake.Today, the tree is still standing but the fire that burned through the area left it charred.\u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t look like that tree is going to recover,\u201d James B Friday, an extension forester with the University of Hawaii, told the New York Times after reviewing photos and videos of the damage. The tree\u2019s thin bark would not have provided adequate protection from the flames, he said.The colossal tree has shaded community events, including art fairs, for 150 years.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the center of town,\u201d Amy Fuqua, a Maui resident, told the Associated Press in a 2016 interview when she was the manager of the Lahaina visitors\u2019 center. \u201cEveryone knows where it\u2019s at.

Photograph: Jennifer McDermott/APAt the time it was planted in 1873, a gift shipped from India to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first Protestant mission in Lahaina, the tree was only an 8ft (2-meter) sapling. It was planted a quarter century before the Hawaiian Islands became a US territory and seven decades after King Kamehameha declared Lahaina the capital of his kingdom.The tree\u2019s enormity \u2013 and its many trunks \u2013 is due to how it grows. Aerial roots dangle from its boughs and eventually latch on to the soil. Branches splay out widely and become roosting places for choirs of myna birds.It has been described as the the \u201cheartbeat of Lahaina Town\u201d.\u201cThere\u2019s just so much meaning attached to it and there\u2019s so many experiences that everyone has.

In a statement released on Monday, Gianmichele Passarini, the president of Cia-Agricoltori Italiani Veneto, said: \u201cFighting such a widespread emergency that is causing thousands of fishermen to struggle with a cookbook is wrong. We need a serious programme to control the blue crab in our waters. It is a mere illusion to hope to eradicate this species in the short to medium term.\u201dAccording to experts, the blue crab has made its way to Italy as a result of shipping and international trade, after being inadvertently loaded onto large cargo vessels when they collect ballast water, which they use to ensure their stability. This water, which is often not filtered before being discharged into the Mediterranean, has allowed the crabs to invade new areas.",

Many cannot be grown in the UK at scale. The former category includes cauliflowers, broccoli and strawberries. It also includes nearly two-thirds of the cucumbers and tomatoes imported to the UK, and nearly a fifth of the overall supply of onions.Additionally, more than half of the UK\u2019s lemons and sweet peppers come from the Mediterranean, along with two-thirds of all oranges and 40% of table grapes. Olive oil is also affected by extreme temperatures; the UK gets 80% of its supplies from the region. This year, it has been one of the foodstuffs with the sharpest increases in price, adding to inflation.According to the report, in 2022 just over a quarter of UK food imports \u2013 9.8bn kg, worth just over \u00a316bn \u2013 came from the Mediterranean region, mostly fresh fruit and vegetables. Spain, which is experiencing some of the worst extreme heat and drought, accounted for 7% of UK food imports \u2013 worth \u00a34bn.Gareth Redmond-King, the head of international programme at the Energy & Climate intelligence Unit, said: \u201cAs well as a climate crisis, we\u2019re in a public health crisis too. Most of us already don\u2019t eat enough fruit and veg, and often healthier diets already tend to cost more.

        "text": "I read with some dismay that I have committed the eco-crime of owning a wood-burning stove (My burning shame: I fitted my house with three wood-burning stoves, 27 December). When I moved into my small cob-and-thatch cottage 10 years ago, there were storage heaters (which I removed) and an open fire that filled the place with smoke due to a jackdaw nest in the chimney. I installed an air-source heat pump, and a small wood-burning stove for extra warmth in winter.This is affordable, as the heat pump is cheap and efficient, and my supply of dry logs will last all winter for a few hundred pounds. Thick walls and low ceilings make it easy to heat the cottage. I find this solution economical and in keeping with my quaint dwelling and an old-fashioned lifestyle, which I had thought was ecological. I do have asthma, which is under control, but the stove may not help. Burning wood is not ideal. But I see no alternative here other than an electric stove, which would be much more expensive to run. My stove also gives a companionable glow on a winter night, which I would be sorry to lose.David CottamMorchard Bishop, Devon George Monbiot berates himself for installing wood-burning stoves, without allowing for the range of building types in the UK. The predominantly stone-built houses in west Wales depend on a circulation of air in order to respect the unique way in which these buildings remain warm yet free of damp. They are not suitable for the modern Passivhaus style of high insulation matched with ground/air-source methods of heating.Heating all of our homes with modern, eco-friendly solutions is an ideal goal but, realistically, it can only be achieved with new-builds.Felicity McGowanCardigan, Ceredigion We moved into our 450-year-old cottage in 1991. It had an open fireplace. For years we burned wood in it for a warm cosy glow, oblivious to the damage it was doing to our health and the environment. Thanks to the Guardian raising awareness of the harm of wood-burning heaters, we did manage to convert ours into a hearth with an electric heater. The results are very pleasing. One day we hope to have a heat pump, but we will have to wait for the prices to come down.Guru SinghShepshed, Leicestershire My terrier and I live on a narrowboat. The only heating that I have is a multi-fuel stove with a back boiler, which ensures the vessel is warm. Gas, oil and electricity are all prohibitively expensive. I usually burn smokeless fuel, as it\u2019s convenient and stays alight more readily overnight. I appreciate that this isn\u2019t ideal, but it\u2019s the only heating system I can afford. I feel, overall, that my terrier and I tread more lightly than most.Dave BickerBarrow upon Soar, Leicestershire If you live in a remote house, sometimes wood burners and open fires are the difference between survival and non-survival. I care about the planet, but Scotland is a cruel environment in the winter. I am grateful not to be dependent on electricity for warmth and light.

One, Aspidoscopulia, looked like a frilly white petticoat caught in a breeze, hoisted aloft on a zigzag stalk. But perhaps the most intriguing was a glass sponge on tall stalks, with what looked like a melon-shaped head with two holes, reminiscent of goggly eyes. This species was nicknamed \u201cthe ET sponge\u201d, after the eponymous character in Steven Spielberg\u2019s hit movie. In 2020, it was given the scientific name Advhena magnifica \u2013 the magnificent alien.Q&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world\u2019s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth \u2013 and how much there is to protect.\u00a0Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Sponges may look like plants but they are in fact simple animals. They have no face, brain, heart, muscles or any other kind of body organ. Most of them spend their lives stuck to the seabed, straining tiny floating particles of food through their spongy bodies.The ET sponge had been seen only once before, a year earlier, thousands of miles to the west near the Mariana Trench. A specimen was taken to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, where the postdoctoral researcher Cristiana Castello Branco immediately knew she was looking at something different. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique shape,\u201d she says.Advhena magnifica builds its body from tiny structures, called spicules, made of silica. Examining these intricate structures under a microscope, Castello Branco saw they were shaped like spiky snowflakes and daisies with drooping petals. \u201cI found some of these very specific spicules very different,\u201d she says. This was not only a new species but a whole new genus of deep-sea sponge that nobody had seen before.The ET sponge Castello Branco studied had been collected using the mechanical arm of a deep-diving robot, controlled via cable by a ship on the surface. In the past, researchers had to make do with studying the often damaged samples of sponges caught in trawl nets. She says the remote technologies are a gamechanger for her work. As well as getting her hands on intact specimens, she can study the animals in their habitats and learn much more about their lives.Video footage of the forest of the weird shows all the ET sponges facing in the same direction. Castello Branco thinks they could be orienting themselves to feed on floating particles brought in on the current sweeping over the tall ridge of the seamount.ET sponge in the \u2018forest of the weird\u2019 more than a mile under the surface of the Pacific Ocean. Photograph: \u2018National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) | Office of Exploration and Research (OER)\u2018Sponges in shallow seas, including the ones divers collect for use in the bath, draw in seawater through tiny holes all over their bodies. They filter out food particles, then exhale water through larger openings. It is likely the ET sponges are doing things differently. Inhaling water through the large surface area of their gaping \u201ceyes\u201d could be an important survival tactic for living in the deep ocean where food is much harder to come by.Discovered in the deep: the \u2018Elvis worms\u2019 that sparkle in the darknessRead moreSo far, ET sponges have only been found in these two places, but Castello Branco thinks there is a good chance they will show up on other seamounts, which she describes as islands of wildlife. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time,\u201d she says. \u201cThese kinds of environments with this diversity of sponges are more common than we used to think.\u201d",

The current figure surpasses the record of 22 such events set in 2020.Greek PM under attack over handling of Storm Daniel disaster responseRead moreSo far, the total cost of disasters in 2023 is more than $57.6bn, according to Noaa.The record figure does not include major disasters such Tropical Storm Hilary last month, as the cost of damage is still being totaled, Adam Smith, the Noaa applied climatologist and economist who tracks the billion-dollar disasters, told the Associated Press. Hilary brought life-threatening flooding and rainfall to the US south-west, leaving thousands of people without power.Smith said the increase in expensive weather events was caused by a rise in the number of natural disasters and more communities being built in risk-prone locations.\u201cExposure plus vulnerability plus climate change is supercharging more of these into billion-dollar disasters,\u201d Smith said.Eight new billion-dollar disasters were added to the list in an update last month. The Hawaii wildfires that killed at least 115 people on Maui were added, with damages there projected to cost upwards of $5.5bn. Hurricane Idalia also caused more than $1bn in damage, as the category 3 hurricane devastated Florida at the end of August.Other events listed by Noaa included severe summer weather, including a Minnesota hailstorm and storms in the north-east, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.\u201cThis year a lot of the action has been across the center states, north central, south and south-eastern states,\u201d Smith.Experts have long pointed out that climate disasters and extreme weather create exceptionally large costs for local governments.Last week, more than 60 million Americans were under heat alerts, an extreme weather event that cities have struggled to allocate funding towards.Experts say the US has to do more to adapt to increased disasters as they are only projected to get worse.\u201cThe climate has already changed, and neither the built environment nor the response systems are keeping up with the change,\u201d the former Federal Emergency Management Agency director Craig Fugate said.The increase in weather disasters is consistent with what climate scientists have long been saying, along with a possible boost this year from the natural El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, the University of Arizona climate scientist Katharine Jacobs said.\u201cAdding more energy to the atmosphere and the oceans will increase intensity and frequency of extreme events,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cMany of this year\u2019s events are very unusual and in some cases unprecedented.\u201dSmith added that he had thought the 2020 record would last for a long time because the $20bn cost of disasters that year smashed the old record of $16bn.It didn\u2019t, and Smith says he no longer believes new records will last long, either.The Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field called the trend in billion-dollar disasters \u201cvery troubling\u201d.\u201cBut there are things we can do to reverse the trend,\u201d Field said. \u201cIf we want to reduce the damages from severe weather, we need to accelerate progress on both stopping climate change and building resilience.\u201dThe Associated Press contributed reporting",

Meanwhile, ExxonMobil quietly withdrew funding for plans to use algae to create low-carbon fuel, while Shell announced it would not increase its investments in renewable energy this year, despite earlier promises to slash its emissions.The letter calls on Barclays to end all financing and underwriting of oil and gas companies \u2013 not only their projects \u2013 and to boost funding of firms behind wind and solar energy significantly.In May, more than 500 students and recent graduates made a similar pledge aimed at insurers that they said supported controversial fossil fuel projects. That letter was directed at the world\u2019s largest insurance market, Lloyd\u2019s of London, and addressed to individual firms including Beazley, Hiscox, Chaucer and Tokio Marine Kiln.\u201cNew recruitment of the younger generation will be another headache for Barclays as long as it continues to finance companies building new oil and gas infrastructure, since it relies heavily on Stem [science, engineering, technology and mathematics] applicants from Oxbridge and other top universities,\u201d said Michelle Hemmingfield, a representative of Students Organising for Sustainability UK, which spearheaded the letter.The career boycott is the latest headache for Barclays, which was targeted by climate campaigners at its AGM in May and faced pressure over its sponsorship of Wimbledon, as well as over its ties to the National Trust. The lender has also been hit by grassroots campaigns, including by a pensioner who refused to pay her council tax because of a link to the bank.A Barclays spokesperson said: \u201cAligned to our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, we believe we can make the greatest difference by working with our clients as they transition to a low-carbon business model, reducing their carbon-intensive activity whilst scaling low-carbon technologies, infrastructure and capacity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They poured $434bn into fossil fuel financing, and this is a company that makes tens of billions of dollars in profit every year.\u201cWe know that London is the heaving engine of financing for fossil fuel companies and as you know we have been protesting at the Oil & Money conference [Energy Intelligence Forum] and JP Morgan have been represented at the conference.\u201cWe are saying at this time of massive inequality and climate change that is damaging the global south, here and now, that we need them to pay for loss and damage for the communities and people affected with some of their profits.\u201dCanary Wharf\u2019s private security workers directed JP Morgan employees to alternative entrances.

Jennings is planning to erect signs along the river to alert the public to the discharges.The signs read: \u201cYou are advised to avoid contact with the river water and suggest you keep pets and livestock out of the river.\u201d The signs inform the public to contact the Environment Agency if they see dead wildlife on or around the river.Chalk streams are a haven for species like the otter, kingfisher, salmon and trout. Jennings said the problem of excessive discharges into the river dated back to 2014, and the Environment Agency was aware of the issue.Jennings said the sewage discharges were a result of four breaches in the system, of which Thames Water was aware. \u201cThe Environment Agency told Thames Water in 2014 and in 2020 to do something about this, that there was a problem here with groundwater ingress. But more than six years later, here we are in 2021 and it is still happening.\u201dA spokesperson for Thames Water said groundwater ingress was the problem. The company said it had set up CCTV to inspect the sewer pipes in the area and gather evidence of how the groundwater was getting into the sewage system. It planned to use the detail from the cameras, to get the funding required to reline the pipes.\u201cOur view is that discharges of untreated sewage are unacceptable, even when they are legally permitted, and we want to accelerate work to stop them being necessary,\u201d the spokesperson said.\u201cWe\u2019re working hard in the Chess catchment to identify where groundwater is getting into the sewer network so we can reduce it, and we\u2019re also funding a citizen science project to monitor the quality of the river.\u201dA sample taken from the Vale Brook Culvert in January.

These limits are set on a site-specific basis to protect the requirements of each chalk stream.\u201d",

This is in addition to the existing hosepipe ban that is already in place for Cornwall and a small part of north Devon.\u201dActivities covered by the ban include using hosepipes to water gardens or clean cars. The company said it hoped the ban would be lifted on 1 December \u2013 or sooner if enough rain falls before then.Customers were told they would not receive a discount since they were charged for water use for the purposes of drinking, washing, sanitation and central heating \u2013 not for non-essential purposes such as watering the garden.The company said it would investigate reported breaches, and that confirmed breaches could result in a fine of up to \u00a31,000.As of the beginning of April, total reservoir capacity across England was at 94%.

Only blood pressure, smoking and diet play a bigger role in whether people die too early.Jane Burston, the executive director of the Clean Air Fund, said cleaning the air saves lives, grows economies and slows the climate crisis, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s the single thing that has the biggest bang for your buck if you fund it.\u201dThe report found that international aid for fossil fuels peaked in 2019 and has fallen fast but still lingers. In 2021, about $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) was spent on fossil fuel projects like building coal plants or gas pipelines, down from $11.9bn two years earlier. The amount spent on tackling outdoor air pollution has risen to $2.3bn.Despite this shift, spending targeted at clean air made up just 1% of international development funding and 2% of international public climate finance between 2015 and 2021, the report found.\u201cThe trend is good but the funding is increasing from a very low base,\u201d said Burston. \u201cIt\u2019s not increasing quickly enough,\u201d she added.Nor has the money been spent in the places that need it most, the report found. Africa received 5% of air quality funding between 2017 and 2021, despite being home to five of the 10 countries with the highest levels of air pollution in the world. At the same time, five polluted Asian countries \u2013 China, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Mongolia and Pakistan \u2013 received 86% of the funding.Scientists are unsure just how many people are killed by dirty air each year but estimates of the death toll run into the millions just from air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels. Fertiliser from farms, road dust from car tyres and natural factors all add to the mortality burden.Outdoor air pollution, which was the focus of the Clean Air Fund report, caused 4.2m premature deaths in 2019, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).Most of the deaths happen in poor and middle-income countries. In countries across Africa and Asia, in which large parts of the population lack access to electricity, governments have struggled to afford clean sources of energy that are cheaper to run than fossil fuel plants but cost more upfront.Some countries have taken big steps to clean up their air. China declared a \u201cwar against pollution\u201d in 2014 and has brought levels of fine particulates down 40% in a decade. As a result, residents of Beijing can expect to live four years longer on average, according to a report from the Air Quality Life Index of the University of Chicago in August.People in rich countries are also choking on dangerous levels of toxic pollutants. An investigation by the Guardian last week found 98% of people in Europe are breathing air clogged with so many pollutants it breaches WHO guidelines.Zorana Jovanovic Andersen, an epidemiologist at the University of Copenhagen and the chair of the environment committee at the European Respiratory Society, said: \u201cThe cost of inaction on air pollution to our health and our societies and economies is already too high and unacceptable. It is time to shift these costs from people and the health sector to those who produce pollution.\u201d",

        "text": "When images of the climate emergency\u2019s impact are so visceral and so widespread, it is easy to neglect what we cannot see. The shocking photographs and video footage of wildfires in Hawaii and Greece, and floods in China, along with the terrible loss of life and testimony from those who fled, are beginning to bring home the contribution of global heating to such disasters \u2013 even if people, and especially businesses and governments, may be slow to accept the truth and even slower to act on it.Yet our eyes cannot fully capture the devastation in Hawaii, and it does not end where its shores meet the sea. Beneath the surface of the water, sediment runoff may smother coral polyps and block sunlight, affecting the growth of colonies, experts warn. This is only one element of a broader disaster now unfolding, which scientists fear may soon be global and yet which has generated relatively little attention or alarm. Corals in countries across Central America, North America and the Caribbean are suffering significant bleaching as they experience unprecedented levels of heat stress due to record ocean temperatures, and there are similar warnings about reefs off northern Vietnam and southern China. In Florida, some sites have reported total loss of all corals.Coral reefs account for only 0.1% of the surface area of the ocean. Yet they support a quarter of the world\u2019s known marine life \u2013 and an estimated half a billion people, for whom they provide food, jobs and coastal defences. Most corals grow less than an inch a year; some deep sea colonies have been developing for more than 4,000 years. But destruction happens at a terrifying pace. Reef cover has halved since the 1950s, with the rate of loss accelerating. And while bleaching does not always lead to the death of corals, scientists say they don\u2019t reproduce as well and are more susceptible to disease \u2013 or further bleaching. As temperature extremes become more frequent, reefs have less time to recover. In 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that 1.5C of global warming \u2013 the level the world is predicted to reach early next decade \u2013 would lead to the destruction of between 70% and 90% of the world\u2019s reefs. A recent study paints an even more alarming picture, suggesting that 99% would experience heatwaves too frequently to recover.Valiant scientists and activists are working on ways to save reefs, such as by nurturing and reintroducing corals \u2013 though some of these projects too have been hit by bleaching recently. Potential mitigations include introducing species that are more resilient to high temperatures \u2013 though adding non-native species to an ecosystem is fraught with its own risks.The focus must be on prevention. Reducing pollutants, especially agricultural runoff, and tackling damage from tourism and overfishing is critical, since these all make reefs more vulnerable to bleaching. But the only real solution is to slash the use of fossil fuels.It is tempting to shock people into such changes, but not always effective. Humans need to be confronted not only by the haunting images of ghost reefs, with life and colour drained from them, but also by the wonder of those that are still healthy, with their fabulous, fantastical populations. Contemplating these ecosystems in all their rainbow glory reminds us not only of what we have lost, but what we must protect.",

        "text": "Populations of the hazel dormouse, perhaps the most elusive native British mammal, have plummeted by 70% this century.The nocturnal, tree-dwelling animals are now extinct in 20 counties in England and the species must be reclassified as \u201cendangered\u201d on the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list, according to a study by the People\u2019s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES).Since the previous State of Britain\u2019s Dormice report was published in 2019, they have vanished from Hertfordshire, Staffordshire and Northumberland.The key factor in their decline is the loss of the scrubby under-storey in woodlands where the arboreal dormice live and feed in spring and summer, but the problem has been compounded by climate change, according to conservation scientists.Dormice hibernate for six months in nests below ground but milder winters mean they are increasingly emerging from hibernation when there is no food available. Between 40% and 70% of dormice die during the hibernation period.Ian White, a dormouse officer at PTES, said: \u201cThere\u2019s an old Worcestershire saying: \u2018Woods don\u2019t grow beneath trees\u2019, and we no longer have this complexity and under-storey in woods because of increased browsing by deer, but also increased shading \u2013 we don\u2019t cut our woodlands enough.\u201cIt\u2019s a double-whammy. Now winters are becoming more mild and variable, there\u2019s a danger that dormice will wake up and they can only do that so many times before they run out of energy. Wetter springs and summers also stop dormice feeding because their fur is not waterproof [so they don\u2019t go out in rain], and they only produce on average four young per year \u2013 they don\u2019t have the breeding potential of mice and rats.\u201cIf the decline continues at the same rate, in another 30 years dormouse populations will have fallen by 94% since 2000, which we simply cannot let happen.\u201dWith its caramel fur, big black eyes and furry tail, the hazel dormouse, or Muscardinus avellanarius, is a flagship species for the conservation of many woodlands. Its presence is an indicator of wider animal and plant diversity, and woodland health.A small army of volunteers are helping the PTES and other charity partners try to arrest the decline. They have been regularly checking hundreds of dormouse nest boxes in woodlands across the country since 1990, the longest-running small terrestrial mammal monitoring programme in the world.Conservationists need to understand if dormouse populations are surviving outside woodlands, and how these populations might be helped.Last year PTES launched its dormouse footprint tunnel survey to monitor non-woodland habitats, including hedgerows and scrubland. Anecdotal evidence suggests some dormice are thriving on scrubby land beside roads and railways.White said: \u201cOnce we have data from non-woodland sites too, we can target conservation efforts more widely, which we hope will start to reverse the decline.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This has ensured dormice are now present in six English counties, mostly in the Midlands and the north, from which they had previously been lost.Large-scale landscape projects to restore and connect prime dormouse habitats have been implemented in Warwickshire and north Wales, while hedgerow planting \u2013 offering safe passage and nesting sites between woodlands \u2013 has taken place in Yorkshire and Hampshire.Based on their study, PTES has called for the reclassification of dormice as \u201cendangered\u201d rather than \u201cvulnerable\u201d on the IUCN red list, which would make them a higher priority species and result in more targeted conservation efforts.White said: \u201cWe know what works for dormice, but we urgently need increased funding to implement this nationally.\u201cHope is not lost, as reintroductions, monitoring, research and landscape projects offer a lifeline \u2013 and some populations appear to be thriving \u2013 but we need to do everything we can on a much bigger scale to prevent the worst case from happening.\u201d",

No overseas offsets would be bought.Australian councils told to cut emissions rather than spend millions on overseas carbon offsetsRead moreKean said buying $80 of credits was the equivalent to offsetting 2.4 tonnes of CO2 \u2013 the average annual emissions of a light vehicle in the state.The transport sector was responsible for 22% of the state\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, with half of that coming from passenger vehicles, Kean said.But critics have lambasted the scheme for potentially deterring people from reducing their emissions.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\u201cThis creates completely the wrong impression for consumers,\u201d Bill Hare, an Australian climate scientist who advised the UN on appropriate use of offsets, said. \u201dIt is a real concern to see the New South Wales government legitimising this through an official scheme.\u201cAt worst that could undermine people\u2019s intent to find ways to reduce emissions from driving. Offsets don\u2019t really reduce emissions, and they don\u2019t compensate for an emission of carbon dioxide coming out of the tailpipe of a car.\u201dHe said the NSW government should focus on a more rapid rollout of electric vehicle charging infrastructure rather than promoting \u201cgimmicks such as offering to offset drivers emissions per year for $80\u201d.Hare said the best ways for people to cut their transport emissions are to use more public transport, bicycles and to get an electric vehicle.\u201cNew South Wales has a good set of policies here but these could be strengthened to make it easier for people in different circumstances to move to electric cars,\u201d Hare said.Dr Jennifer Rayner, head of advocacy at the not-for-profit Climate Council, said public transport improvements and steps to make it easier for people to walk and ride were two key changes to shift people \u201caway from polluting cars altogether\u201d.\u201cGiven the range of clean transport options that are readily available, the focus for this sector should be on achieving near absolute zero emissions.

It is unclear whether the latest breach will lead to a financial penalty.A woodchip pile at a Amite BioEnergy site. Photograph: DraxThe notice of violation, issued in March, said the company was permitted to emit 24 tons (22 tonnes) a year of hazardous air pollutants on a rolling 12-month basis, but reached as much as 37 tons between January 2021 and December 2022, peaking in July 2022.The MDEQ asked Amite for an explanation and what action it had taken to correct the violation.In response, Drax argued that pellet production was a relatively young industry, adding: \u201cSeveral wood pellet facilities, not only Amite BioEnergy, initially underestimated emissions in connection with the permitting of these facilities.\u201cAmite BioEnergy has a history of acting quickly to update emissions and permits upon discovery of new emission factors and new information pertaining to other pellet production plants.\u201dAmite argued that, according to its analysis, it was only non-compliant for a short period \u2013 between late October and early November 2021.Great Britain\u2019s energy regulator, Ofgem, has launched an investigation, which will be carried out by the US consulting group Black & Veatch, over whether Drax\u2019s operations are aligned with biomass sustainability rules.Last year, the UK government was accused of funding \u201cenvironmental racism\u201d in the US south by providing subsidies to Drax. The company, which has a stock market valuation of more than \u00a32bn, received \u00a3617m in government subsidies in 2022.In the US, Matt Williams, a campaigner for Cut Carbon Not Forests and a senior advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said of Drax: \u201cIt\u2019s already been fined once.

They should then use this as a guide to ensure they are collecting or buying the most suitable wildflowers for their gardens.An orange tip butterfly \u2013 one of the myriad species attracted by a lady\u2019s smock. Photograph: Albaimages/AlamySwedish researchers who study pollination and biodiversity at Lund University reiterated the importance of going local as the wildflower season blooms across Europe. \u201cDon\u2019t collect seeds further away than you can cycle is usually a good rule of thumb,\u201d said ecologist Maj Rundl\u00f6f. Nearly one in 10 wild bee species faces extinction in Europe, data suggests, and the public is increasingly keen to help them. She believes there should be more information available about what to put where.Rundl\u00f6f said: \u201cIt\u2019s like our food, without knowing where something comes from, we wouldn\u2019t know how to make the right choice. It\u2019s the same with these seeds \u2013 labelling is important because it provides people with the information that enables them to choose.\u201dSeed suppliers in Sweden are wrongly marketing their ready-mixed seeds as meadow flowers when the packets contain ornamental plants and grassy weeds from abroad that should not be in a traditional meadow, said Rundl\u00f6f and her colleague, Lina Herbertsson. The Swedish Botanical Society is calling for packets of wildflower seeds to carry labels showing their origin to prevent people accidentally spreading non-native species in the wild.In the UK, sourcing seeds from local donor sites \u2013 provided it is in line with official guidance \u2013 will help rejuvenate the country\u2019s regional wildflower meadows, which are all different and have adapted to local soils and pollinator populations. Local nature reserves or nature-friendly farmers may be able to share their seeds at the end of the summer.Common bird\u2019s-foot trefoil is a typical insect-friendly meadow flower. Photograph: Nature Photographers/AlamyMatt Pitts, a meadows adviser at Plantlife, in the UK, said: \u201cOur old meadows have subtle differences \u2013 there might be species that only grow well in Devon and Cornwall, for example.\u201dThe problem with wildflower seed mixes \u2013 even if they are native \u2013 is that they are often one-size fits all. \u201cYou\u2019re getting generic wildflower mixes and starting to lose regional diversity,\u201d Pitts said. Some packets of seeds incorrectly labelled as \u201cwildflower meadow mixtures\u201d often contain common poppies, corn marigolds and cornflowers, which don\u2019t occur naturally in that combination in any habitat in Britain, according to Plantlife.Many insects only like visiting specific plants. For example, long-tongued bumblebees are well suited to pollinating red clover, and orange-tip butterflies lay their eggs on lady\u2019s smock. Typical insect-friendly meadow flowers in the UK are oxeye daisy, common knapweed, bird\u2019s-foot trefoil and field scabious.A good meadow should not just be a food source for pollinators, but should provide winter forage and a mix of grasses all year round, said Pitts.Another solution is to just wait and see what comes up, using a natural regeneration method that is also recommended for woodland restoration. Leaving grass to grow long as part of \u201cno mow May\u201d is an opportunity to see what wildflowers naturally emerge in your garden, and you may be surprised at what pops up if you leave the mower in the shed.Gardeners should grow wildflowers that attract pollinators.

        "text": "The UK\u2019s international development minister, Andrew Mitchell, has played down the prospects of imposing a levy on frequent flyers to help fund the rescue and rehabilitation of poor countries stricken by climate disaster.A small charge on airline tickets is one of several ideas floated by developing countries to provide cash for the loss and damage fund.The fund was set up at the Cop28 UN climate summit but is grossly under-resourced, with only about $700m having been pledged so far. The needs of developing countries are likely to reach hundreds of billions a year, and this is unlikely to be met only from the public purses of developed countries, so most countries agree that new sources of funding must be found.An airline levy is one of the frontrunners, but Mitchell indicated it could struggle to gain support from the British government. He told the Guardian at Cop28 that this was not an official position but his own view. However, Rishi Sunak has previously acted to reduce air passenger duty in the UK, so it would be little surprise if he vetoed other levies on flying.The frequent flyer levy was proposed last year by the V20 group of the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries, and has broad support among many developed and developing countries. Eamon Ryan, the Irish environment minister who is charged with examining innovative sources of finance for the EU, said: \u201cThere are various principles behind it that make sense: \u2018polluter pays\u2019 is a basic principle, and there\u2019s equity to it. It\u2019s the wealthier people in the world who fly.\u201dHe said the tax need not be large: a small levy on each of the hundreds of millions of international flight tickets sold each year would raise billions, and the EU was already looking at the issue of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be punitive,\u201d he told the Guardian in a separate interview at the climate conference.Other innovative sources of finance under consideration include a possible carbon levy on shipping. Steps have already been taken at the International Maritime Organization to put this into practice, after a softening this year of previously strong opposition from the shipping industry and some countries with large fleets.Taxes on the profits of fossil fuel companies are another possibility, favoured by Gordon Brown, the former prime minister. Mitchell said that the UK was already levying its own windfall tax on oil and gas producers, though its proceeds are not linked to climate funds.Ryan said there was no single answer to raising cash for the loss and damage fund, and other forms of climate finance, but that a \u201cmosaic\u201d approach would be needed. \u201cI hope there is language in the text [the final outcome from Cop28] that will allow us to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to do it, not wait for two years of negotiations and then press the green button. It\u2019s already starting to happen, we need to accelerate by giving a signal here [in Dubai].\u201dMitchell said getting more \u201cnon-traditional\u201d donors to contribute to the loss and damage fund was also essential. In the past, only long industrialised countries such as the UK, the US and the EU were expected to pay for climate finance in the most vulnerable countries. But with the new loss and damage fund, all countries with the means are \u201cencouraged\u201d by the text to contribute.Only the United Arab Emirates, the host country of Cop28, has so far contributed, however, with $100m. Saudi Arabia, despite its oil wealth and its immense offers of cash to footballers, has kept its purse strings tight, and China\u2019s climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, told journalists at the weekend that it was already helping developing nations through its own initiatives, indicating that it was unlikely to make a contribution to the loss and damage fund.Michell said the UAE\u2019s donation was what had prompted the UK\u2019s \u00a360m contribution, which came from the government\u2019s existing climate aid budget of \u00a311.6bn by 2025.\u201cOn loss and damage, we want different donors, not just traditional donors \u2013 UAE is one such donor, and so that opened our coffers. But we also want new and imaginative ways of raising funding. Because otherwise, we\u2019re just plundering the same pot,\u201d he said.Mitchell said the UK was also backing reforms to the international financial systems that would benefit developing countries, including new rules for the World Bank to ease its low-cost lending for climate projects in poor countries. \u201cBritain is having an impact here [at Cop28], but we have lost some of our leadership DNA in recent years. And we need to try and win it back,\u201d he conceded.",

It was much more likely to be a human, he said.\u201cThe one thing you can be sure of is that someone not something has taken its head off,\u201d he said.\u201cWhether they killed it and then decided to take its head, or whether they found it already dead can only be determined through an autopsy.\u201dPhotographer Tom Hayes says the crocodile\u2019s head was \u2018obviously surgically removed\u2019 by a human. Photograph: Tom HayesThe Queensland Department of Environment and Science investigated the incident but said it was unable to determine the cause of death and decapitation of the protected species due to the decomposed state of the corpse.The north Queensland crocodile photographer and conservationist Tom Hayes, who travelled to see the corpse hours after it was discovered by locals, said it appeared obvious to him that the corpse had been desecrated by a human being.\u201cIf it was another crocodile, it would tear it off from the least-resistant point at the spine just above the shoulders \u2013 this was obviously surgically removed from the base of the skull,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.Hayes said the carcass had cut marks that looked like they had come from a machete. It also appeared the animal\u2019s nails and other parts had been ripped off. He said he believed it was likely that the head of the crocodile had been kept as a trophy.\u201cSome people just genuinely hate crocodiles,\u201d he said. \u201cOther people think that if they take out the big croc that their waterways are going to be safe.\u201cBut the reality is that it just opens the door for younger, more aggressive and testosterone-fuelled males to enter.\u201dKilling or desecrating crocodiles is illegal, but Hayes said the reinforcement of those laws in more remote areas was lacking. He criticised the government for failing to investigate the incident with the same zeal as an investigation into a crocodile attack in February at the nearby Bloomfield River, where a crocodile attacked a man and ate his pet dog after they waded into the water.

In the mid-19th century there were about 9,000 wolves distributed throughout the country. A policy of eradication meant that by the 1970s only a few hundred remained.When poisoning was outlawed in the 1970s, the species began to recover. In the most recent census, in 2021, there were between 2,000-2,500 wolves in 297 packs, 90% of which were in the north-west, principally in Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Galicia and Asturias, where they enjoyed protected species status that has banned wolf hunting since 2021.The Spanish government\u2019s wolf recovery plan announced in 2021 aimed for an 18% increase in the population, from 297 to 350 packs. However, a study published last year by the natural history museum in Madrid suggests that official estimates of Spain\u2019s wolf population are overly optimistic and that numbers are much lower than claimed.\u201cPopulations are typically assessed over a period of two years which is insufficient to determine within a significant margin of error whether a population is increasing, in decline or stable,\u201d said Victoria Gonz\u00e1lez, a researcher on the project.",

Miami, and Miami Beach, cities often cited as ground zero for the climate emergency, frequently see flooding during high tides. Property insurance rates throughout Florida, which Noaa says has experienced more than 40% of all US hurricane strikes, have soared in recent years.The two most expensive hurricanes in US history, Katrina in 2005 and Harvey in 2017, ravaged New Orleans, Louisiana, and Houston, Texas, respectively,Earlier this month, the Guardian carried an extract from a new book about how Charleston, South Carolina, is facing a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of rising sea levels and racism that leaves the city, in the view of many observers, living on borrowed time.\u201cWhat is likely to happen in Charleston is likely, absent a substantial shift in attitude, to happen in many other coastal cities around the globe,\u201d wrote Susan Crawford, author of Charleston: Race, Water, and the Coming Storm.The Post reported on a second study, published on Monday on nature.com, effectively mirroring the finding of the Arizona analysis that an \u201cacceleration\u201d of sea-level rise was under way.Researchers at Tulane University, New Orleans, also note that the increase in the Gulf and south-eastern region is greater than the global average, a surge of greater than 0.4in per year they say is \u201cunprecedented in at least 120 years\u201d.The study, which says the rise is \u201camplified by internal climate variabilities\u201d, cites storms such as Katrina, and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, that \u201cillustrate that any further increases in the rate of MSL [mean sea-level] rise, particularly rapid ones, threaten the national security of the US and hamper timely adaptation measures.\u201dHuman activity in the Gulf region, which the researchers refer to as \u201cvertical land motion\u201d (VLM), has played a role, the study continues.\u201cIt is well known that tide gauges in the Gulf of Mexico are subject to significant nonlinear VLM, likely related to oil, gas, or groundwater withdrawal. These nonlinear changes appear predominantly along the western portions of the US Gulf coast (Louisiana and Texas),\u201d it says.",

        "text": "Birds have never shied away from turning human rubbish into nesting materials, but even experts in the field have raised an eyebrow at the latest handiwork to emerge from urban crows and magpies.Nests recovered from trees in Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Antwerp in Belgium were found to be constructed almost entirely from strips of long metal spikes that are often attached to buildings to deter birds from setting up home on the structures.The discovery prompted researchers at the Natural History Museum in Rotterdam and the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden to scour the internet for further examples, leading to the identification of another anti-bird spike nest in Glasgow. One of the reviewers of the study then flagged a fourth nest in Enschede in the Netherlands.\u201cI really thought I\u2019d seen it all,\u201d said Kees Moeliker, the director of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam, who studied the crow\u2019s nest found during tree maintenance near the city\u2019s main railway station. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this. These anti-bird spikes are meant to deter birds, they are supposed to scare them off, but on the contrary, the birds just utilise them.\u201dA magpie with some more traditional nest material in its beak. Photograph: blickwinkel/AlamyWhile the Rotterdam nest was made by crows, the other three were built by magpies, which construct large dome-like nests. The crows used the anti-bird spikes as a sturdy construction material, but the magpies may have appreciated their intended use: they placed most of the spikes on the nest\u2019s roof where they could deter predators, including other birds and weasels.Auke-Florian Hiemstra, a biologist at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, said: \u201cEven for me as a nest researcher, these are the craziest bird nests I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dMagpies\u2019 nest made from anti-bird spikes and a strip of the spikes (bottom right). Photograph: Auke-Florian Hiemstra / Naturalis Biodiversity CenterIt is not the first time birds have been found to incorporate urban materials into their nests. In 1933, a South African museum reported a crow\u2019s nest fashioned from hard-drawn copper, galvanised iron and barbed wire. Nails, screws and even drug users\u2019 syringes have all found their way into birds\u2019 nests.About 25 years ago, Moeliker collected a pigeon\u2019s nest from an oil refinery in Rotterdam harbour, a place he described as having \u201cnothing green, only industry, concrete and bad air\u201d.The nest was made not from twigs but chicken wire. As an example of birds\u2019 ability to adapt to the urban environment, he considered it the ultimate. \u201cIt turns out that it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said, in view of the latest crow and magpie nests. They are described in Deinsea, the annual of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam.Rather than finding old strips of anti-bird spikes at rubbish dumps, Moeliker, who previously won an Ig Nobel prize for documenting the first known case of homosexual necrophilia among ducks, says crows and magpies appear to be finding and removing the metal strips from buildings. \u201cThey are ripping the stuff off. It\u2019s been observed in several kinds of birds,\u201d he said.On Monday, a European team of researchers warned that nearly 200 bird species build nests with potentially dangerous human litter ranging from cigarette butts to plastic bags and fishing nets. Dr Jim Reynolds, an ornithologist at the University of Birmingham, who took part in that work said he was \u201camazed\u201d at the anti-bird spike nests, but added that if any group of birds was going to do it, it would be the corvids, who are known for their cognitive skills.\u201cI was really struck by the irony, to take anti-bird devices and use them to their own ends,\u201d Reynolds said. \u201cThey are even more amazing than I think they are.\u201d As well as helping to protect the nests, the spikes may also serve as a display to impress potential mates, he said.A crow. Members of the corvid family are known for the cognitive skills.

In 2017, residents in the leafy Clifton neighbourhood of Bristol fixed bird-repelling spikes to trees to stop pigeons perching on the branches and creating a mess on parked cars below.\u201cWe should not deter birds, we should embrace birds and live together with them,\u201d said Moeliker. \u201cThese birds are very smart and they always find ways to cope with the harsh urban life. I\u2019m very sympathetic towards these crows and magpies. They are my heroes.\u201d This article was amended on 12 July 2023.

        "text": "Several groups of treasure hunters have been seen on the East River in New York City after a guest on the Joe Rogan podcast claimed a boxcar of valuable prehistoric mammoth bones was dumped in the river in the 1940s.Despite a lack of evidence, treasure seekers have used boats, diving gear and remote-operated cameras to search.\u201cI think the chances are just as good as the lottery. And people buy those tickets every day,\u201d said Don Gann, 35, of North Arlington, New Jersey, a commercial diver who has been out on the water since early last week, with his brother and two workers.It all started when John Reeves, an Alaskan gold miner with a passion for fossils, appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience on 30 December to talk about his land, where he has uncovered bones and tusks and where, in the early 20th century, digging for gold unearthed prehistoric mammal remains.Some of that material was brought to New York, to be given to the American Museum of Natural History. Reeves cited a draft of a report by three men, including one who worked at the museum, that included a reference to some fossils and bones deemed unsuitable for the museum being dumped in the river.\u201cI\u2019m going to start a bone rush,\u201d Reeves told Rogan, before reading from the draft and giving out a location: FDR Drive, at around 65th Street.\u201cWe\u2019ll see if anybody out there\u2019s got a sense of adventure,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cLet me tell you something about mammoth bones, mammoth tusks \u2013 they\u2019re extremely valuable.\u201dThe American Museum of Natural History said: \u201cWe do not have any record of the disposal of these fossils in the East River, nor have we been able to find any record of this report in the museum\u2019s archives or other scientific sources.\u201dReached by phone, Reeves told a reporter to read the draft he posted on social media. Those pages identify as the authors Richard Osborne, an anthropologist; Robert Evander, who worked in the museum paleontology department; and Robert Sattler, an archeologist with a consortium of Alaska Native tribes.Sattler said the story about the dumped bones came from Osborne, who died in 2005. The document cited by Reeves was real, he said, and written in the mid-1990s. But it wasn\u2019t intended for an academic journal. It was a starting point for something, maybe a book, based on Osborne\u2019s knowledge of a period in Alaska when mammoth remains were discovered.Sattler said Osborne spent time around the operation as a young man and probably heard the story about surplus bones being dumped in the New York river.Mammoth remains discovered in Alaska did wind up at the American Museum of Natural History, including some still on display.But the section of the Manhattan shoreline where Reeves claimed the bones were dumped underwent major changes in the 1930s and 1940s, as the East River Drive, later named for Franklin D Roosevelt, was constructed on fill and pilings. The highway opened in 1942, raising questions about how someone would have dumped a huge trove of bones without disrupting traffic.Gann said he had seen about two dozen other sets of fossil hunters out searching for mammoth remains. Visibility in the East River is extremely poor, he said. On a good day, you can see maybe a foot. The current at the bottom is strong.Gann, who appeared in Discovery\u2019s Sewer Divers, added: \u201cI\u2019ve hunted for weird artifacts my entire life, so this one, it just kind of fits into my repertoire.\u201dHe and his crew hadn\u2019t found anything and had switched to a location off southern Brooklyn, perhaps a more likely site for cargo to be dumped.\u201cIf I find nothing, then I find nothing,\u201d Gann said. \u201cI gave it an honest shot.\u201d",

Because they cannot usually be recycled, the majority are disposed of in landfill or by incineration.The lead author, Siswanti Zuraida, and colleagues prepared concrete and mortar samples by combining washed, dried, and shredded disposable nappy waste with cement, sand, gravel, and water, curing the samples for 28 days. They then tested six samples containing different proportions of waste to measure how much pressure they could withstand without breaking. They then calculated the maximum proportion of sand that could be replaced with disposable nappies in a range of building materials.The researchers found concrete made with nappies was as good as conventional materials. They said: \u201cThe research also demonstrated that the mechanical properties and microbial content of disposable diaper concrete, in specific compositions, are identical to conventional concrete. Adding 1% diaper to concrete enhances internal curing hydration and produces the most robust, durable material. In addition, a mixture of up to 5% disposable diapers with concrete had the maximum strength at 28 days compared to other percentages.\u201dThe scientists said it was unlikely the use of nappies in the mixture would have any negative effects on health, as sodium chloride could be used to sanitise them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In Madrid, a 32% fall in NO2 concentrations was observed after an LEZ was introduced in 2018.In the UK, a public consultation launched by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, on expanding the city\u2019s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) to cover the entire capital next year is due to conclude at the end of July.Jemima Hartshorn, the founder of Mums for Lungs, told the Guardian: \u201cWe\u2019ve just seen how effective the London Ulez has been at reducing air pollution. There has been a 20% drop in NO2 since the zone was expanded. It\u2019s great to hear a growing number of other European cities are also taking air quality seriously.\u201dItaly tops Europe\u2019s clean air table, with 172 declared clean air zones, compared with 78 in Germany, 17 in the UK, 14 in the Netherlands and 8 in France.Few LEZs have been set up in central and eastern Europe, but Poland and Bulgaria are expected to unveil new zones in the months ahead.The new study argues that now is the time to step up the action, by moving to zero-emission zones (ZEZs) ahead of a planned phase-out of new fossil fuel vehicles in the EU by 2035 and the UK by 2030.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am BSTUp to 35 ZEZ\u2019s are planned in Europe by 2030, with 26 solely addressing delivery vehicles in the Netherlands.

But the bull\u2019s arrival from Germany had been delayed by five months due to post-Brexit paperwork complexities. The herd also has a young calf, thanks to a surprise birth in September.The bull arrived on Friday but it was three hours before it chose to leave the transporter, perhaps deterred by the pouring rain and a little sluggish after sedation during the journey. In the end, the sight of the females reportedly appeared to tempt the bull out. Bison are gentle giants and the completed herd sniffed, nuzzled and ate together for a while, before retreating into the woodland.The project is a collaboration between the Kent Wildlife Trust and the Wildwood Trust, and aims to use the free-living bison as \u201cecosystem engineers\u201d to naturally rewild a former pine wood plantation. Bison\u2019s taste for bark kills some trees and their bulk opens up trails, letting light spill on to the forest floor, while their love of rolling around in dust baths creates more open ground for new plants, invertebrates and birds.Mark Habben of the Wildwood Trust said: \u201cThe arrival of the bull marks the start of the Wilder Blean journey in earnest and it\u2019s incredibly fitting that it coincides with a new year. I feel a bit emotional to be honest, it\u2019s been such a long time in the making.\u201dStan Smith of the Kent Wildlife Trust said: \u201cWe want to demonstrate that a hands-off, nature-based solution exists to combat the climate and biodiversity crises we face, and intend that the Wilder Blean Project will become a blueprint for other organisations to take forward.\u201dThe Kent project expects the herd will breed and is licensed for up to 10 bison. In future, it hopes to provide bison to found other herds in the UK, as well as exchanging animals across Europe. All 9,000 bison living in Europe are descended from just 12 zoo animals, which saved the species from extinction in the early 20th century, so maximising genetic diversity is important.The female bison, from Ireland and Scotland, were originally released into a five-hectare (12-acre) enclosure, so their health could be closely monitored while they adapted to their new home. In November, they were given access to a 50-hectare area.Donovan Wright, a bison ranger, was observing as the herd made their first steps into the 50-hectare area, and said: \u201cIt was an incredible moment, the matriarch led the younger females into their new home, making a beeline for the sweet chestnut trees and tucking in right away.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Used by scientists and weather forecasters, it is less well known to the wider public.Medicanes, which tend to form over parts of the Mediterranean Sea near the north African coast, are similar to hurricanes and typhoons although they can develop over cooler waters.Destruction of Derna: why was flooding so bad in Libyan port city?Read moreThey can also bear a physical resemblance on satellite imagery as a swirling mass of storm clouds surrounding an eye in the middle.Fierce winds and rain are unleashed; Storm Daniel dumped approximately 170 millimetres of rain in Libya. This will intensify with global warming, scientists say.\u201cWe are confident that climate change is supercharging the rainfall associated with such storms,\u201d said University of Reading professor Liz Stephens.The Mediterranean cyclones are usually smaller and weaker than their tropical equivalents and have a smaller space in which to develop.Their peak strength is usually the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, encompassing speeds of 119-153km (74-95 miles) per hour.Medicanes tend to form in the autumn when the sea is warm, usually in the western Mediterranean and the region between the Ionian Sea and the north African coast, explained Suzanne Gray, a professor at the University of Reading\u2019s meteorology department.A layer of colder air from higher altitudes forms convections with warmer air rising from the sea that converge around a centre of low pressure.Medicanes form once or twice per year on average, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Before striking Libya, Daniel pummelled Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey last week.Three medicanes occurred off Greece between 2016 and 2018, while in 2019 Spanish weather services identified one between the Balearic Islands and the Algerian coast.A medicane packing winds of up to 120 kilometres per hour, dubbed Ianos, lashed Greece in September 2020, killing three people in the city of Karditsa and triggering floods, landslides and power cuts.The Italian island of Sicily was also struck in 2021.In 2020, French weather monitor Meteo-France said it was difficult to work out climate signals from medicanes due to their rarity.While scientists are increasingly able to unpick the likely effect of climate change on the probability of an extreme weather event happening and its intensity, no such attribution study has yet been carried out on Daniel.In general, experts say the warming of sea surface temperatures, driven by human-induced climate change, is going to make extreme storms more intense.Oceans have absorbed 90% of the excess heat produced by human activity since the dawn of the industrial age, according to scientists.Spanish researchers said the Mediterranean reached its highest temperature on record in July as Europe baked under a series of heatwaves.The surface waters of the eastern Mediterranean and Atlantic are two to three degrees Celsius warmer than usual, which would have turbocharged Daniel.\u201cThe fact that Daniel could form into a medicane \u2026 is likely a result of warmer sea surface temperatures and hence human-made climate change,\u201d added climate scientist Karsten Haustein of Leipzig University in Germany.",

Pythons are typically found near wetlands or open bodies of water.In Florida, these snakes have a large breeding population within and around the Florida Everglades and have proved devastating to native wildlife, despite many efforts over recent years to reduce their numbers and desperate hopes to eradicate them, while sometimes finding other uses for their skins.The Everglades Cooperative Invasive Species Management Area, an inter-agency partnership, noted that Burmese pythons \u201care a threat to native wildlife and ecosystems of south Florida\u201d. It added: \u201cTheir presence has led to severe declines in Everglades mammal populations.\u201dThe organization cautioned those living in the same areas of these snakes to make their yards less attractive by removing excess debris and maintaining landscaping.Waleri said: \u201cIt\u2019s awesome to be able to make an impact on south Florida\u2019s environment.

It\u2019s a great way to preserve an abundance of sprouts over the festive season.Brussels sprouts kimchiI once made kimchi on Saturday Kitchen with James Martin back in 2014, and we served it on bruschetta with pulled pork. It\u2019s a truly excellent combo that has to be tried, so next time you roast some pork, make extra and save it for this dish. Shred the pork and reheat in a frying pan until it\u2019s hot right through, then put in a warmed burger bun and top with a spoonful of kimchi.Brussel\u2019s sprouts are like whole mini cabbages, and make a really cute and seasonal festive kimchi. Once the kimchi has started to ferment, you can leave it on the counter to ferment some more, or put it in the fridge, which will slow down the process. Either way, it should keep for months, if not years. It should be out of direct sunlight and prefers to be in a cool, dark cupboard where the temperature is more stable. Do watch out for mould, though; if any forms on the top, put the lot in the food waste bin. You can help prevent mould by making sure the vegetables are all submerged in the liquid \u2013 just press them down with a fork, and if need be keep them down with a weight.Kimchi is often made with rice flour, which is made into a porridge and mixed with pureed onion, garlic, fish sauce and Korean chilli flakes (gochugaru) or gochujang. As a wholefood cook, however, I like to use brown rice, so I have suggested making your own brown rice flour for this recipe. It\u2019s much easier than you might think, but does require a high-speed blender or spice grinder. Regular white rice flour will work fine, though, as will wheat flour and gluten-free flour.Makes 2 x 500g jars500g brussels sprouts, and/or other greens250g mixed seasonal vegetables (eg, carrots, jerusalem artichokes, squash, turnip, kohlrabi)100g dark green leek tops or spring onionsSea salt4 tbsp brown rice, or white rice flour, gluten-free flour or wheat flour6 garlic cloves, peeled1 small red or white onion, peeled4 tbsp gochujang, or Korean chilli powder or red chilli flakes50ml fish sauceCut all the sprouts in half and put in a large bowl. Cut the mixed vegetables and leek tops or spring onions into matchsticks, and add to the bowl. Cover with cold water and season with plenty of sea salt so it tastes as salty as the sea. Leave for two hours, then drain in a colander.Meanwhile, with a high-speed blender or spice mill, grind the brown rice into flour and tip into a small saucepan (if you don\u2019t have any brown rice, use four tablespoons of ready-made white rice flour, wheat flour or gluten-free flour instead). Whisk in 400ml water, put on a medium heat and cook, stirring, for a few minutes, until the mix thickens and starts to bubble. Simmer for another minute until it turns into an opaque porridge, then take off the heat.Put the garlic, onion, gochujang and fish sauce (or water) in a blender, add the porridgey rice mix and blitzto a puree. Transfer to a large bowl, add the drained vegetables and with clean hands, toss to coat. Pack into clean jars, pushing the vegetables under the liquid, then seal and leave at room temperature for at least four days, until it starts to bubble and ferment; open the jars once a day, to release excess gases and \u201cburp\u201d the kimchi.",

        "text": "In the southern Australian cities where I\u2019ve spent most of my life my birthday on the second day of autumn has always been synonymous with gentle seasonal transition.It\u2019s no coincidence that the beginning of autumn in March is my favourite time of year. First comes the softer light. The mornings grow darker and slightly crisper.In Sydney where I live now, March usually relieves us of the wicked humidity of January and February just as a soft russet dusts the canopies of the deciduous trees. The daybreak dog walk becomes a comforting joy, a soothing celebration of the dawn instead of summer\u2019s sweaty race against the blazing sun through damp, hot air with panting animals.The older I get (into the mid-autumnal stage now \u2013 or so I hope) the more I regard autumn as a languid time of planning and organisation, a muse ahead of what words I\u2019ll aim to assemble and reassemble through winter\u2019s chill.Sydney moves to autumn without drumroll - surprising for this drama queen of a city | Paul DaleyRead moreBoardies and T-shirt are mostly still good for the glorious golden daytimes. But the evening walk would likely require getting out the trackies and a light jumper. And the old footy socks to ward against the chill of the floorboards (Sydney houses all usually become deceptively cold about now). And we\u2019re usually under the doona by now, too, and closing the bedroom windows for sleep.March is synonymous with footy season of course (NRL and the real one, AFL; I am a deep southerner by birth and remain so culturally despite the glittering allure of Sydney). And March is also about getting the Christmas ham bone from the freezer, making it into soup. Figs. Baked with prosciutto and cheese. The first batch of osso buco in the Dutch oven for the year.But there\u2019s been none of that this March where I am. Well, none of that except the footy, that is, where we\u2019ve watched players in both codes struggle dangerously with temperatures into the mid- and high 40s. (Watching footy on the telly, meanwhile, feels irreconcilable with the blasting of the air-conditioning.)After a very mild December, January and February \u2013 a non-summer here really \u2013 March has come, not characteristically considerate and kindly, but unforgiving, scorching and oppressively humid. Autumn 2023 has so far been totally skewwhiff, its opening score devoid of its customary cadence and meter.Forget the slow-cooked food for now. Don\u2019t de-pill the trackies just yet. Barefoot is fine, still.When so much of emotional rhythm is seasonally influenced as it tends to be for many people (ardour and joy in spring; carefree hedonism in summer, forbearance in winter) it can be discombobulating when March comes by without bringing its usual atmospherics.After John Howard took Australia to war in Iraq, he was scarcely held to account. Instead, he was re-elected | Paul DaleyRead moreOn the buses and ferries and trains, in the dog parks and shops and on the streets, people complain about feeling unsettled, exhausted \u2013 about the \u201cweirdness\u2019\u2019 of it. Weather analysts and scientists talk, naturally, about climate change and extremes. Of fire and flood and drought.We know that the globe is teetering irrevocably on the edge of climate damage that requires immediate remedying. Action that the world, for the most part, refuses to take because global and national politics are singularly incapable of meeting the challenge.All of the \u201cweirdness\u2019\u2019 people worry about \u2013 the climactic and seasonal variations, the droughts and flooding rains, the fish kills, the marine extinctions \u2013 have lineage in human-induced climate damage.As I write, one tantalisingly cool real autumnal March day has given way to another with uncomfortable humidity. Tomorrow will be hotter and stickier still.Is it too soon to be nostalgic for all those soft, gentle Marchs? Here\u2019s hoping not. Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist",

I think we will very quickly deplete any species that we stop farming.\u201dAccording to a recent report by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (Abares), Aquaculture has become Australia\u2019s most valuable seafood industry, overtaking wild caught fish for the first time in 2021-2022 in terms of gross value of production (GVP) and hitting a peak value of over $2bn.The report found that the sector\u2019s GVP increased 9% in 2021 and now accounts for 56% of the total value of the seafood industry.\u201cThe demand for freshwater crayfish is insatiable,\u201d Valverde said. \u201cAnd the prices are really good. We just have the problem of \u2013 as farmers \u2013 figuring out how to produce enough of them.\u201cIf you can grow them, you can sell them.\u201d\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nDr Kelly Condon, researcher at James Cook University and aquaculture expert, said the industry was growing thanks to large-scale investment and improvements in its resilience and efficiency.\u201cAquaculture production is really efficient,\u201d she said. \u201cThe big costs are in labour and electricity. But if you get to the economy of scale on the farm it can be extremely profitable with a much higher production for unit area.\u201cYou can easily get 10,000kg of stock out of one hectare with a lot more consistent product.\u201dIn 2020-21, the production volume on fish farms grew 24% while wild-catch fish increased by just 0.3%. Farmed fish now makes up 43% of all fish produced in Australia.Farmed red claw freshwater crayfish. Aquaculture has now become Australia\u2019s most valuable seafood industry.

But she said this came with a \u201ctrade-off\u201d as fish farms were more affected by electricity prices.Valverde said fish farms were less market exposed than wild-caught fish because they had greater control on the supply side.\u201cWe\u2019re in the fortunate position that if we can\u2019t sell today, we can just leave them in the ponds, they just keep getting bigger and worth more and we can sell them later and always get our money back,\u201d he said.He added that labour shortages were a bigger concern.\u201cWhat holds us back is not having enough farmers to produce,\u201d he said. \u201cWe desperately need more farmers producing to increase supply, but we do have a lot of new people getting into it, because the prices are so good.\u201dThe Abares agricultural forecast states that aquaculture will continue to grow and will account for 64% of total seafood GVP by 2027\u201328, despite a decline in real value in 2022-23 as pandemic price spikes stabilise.However despite that strong growth prediction, the report said that future of the industry was still unsure as demand for many products, such as red rock lobster, were highly dependent on income growth and increased consumer spending domestically and abroad.\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community\n",

No renewal or extension of the funding deal, first forged 27 years ago, has been announced by either party.Responses by the museum under freedom of information legislation state that between October 2021 and December 2022, the most recent date covered by the disclosures, the museum and BP exchanged no correspondence and held no discussions about signing a new funding deal.Before that, senior museum figures including its director, Hartwig Fischer, met a member of BP staff in September and October 2021, the museum has said, \u201cbut \u2026 we confirm that we do not hold any information suggesting that \u2026 the possible renewal of, or extension to, the company\u2019s sponsorship agreement with the British Museum was referred to or discussed during any of the interactions listed\u201d.Despite the expiry of their contract, both the British Museum and BP remain tight-lipped about the nature of their current and future association. The museum referred the Guardian only to an ambiguous previous statement that \u201cBP is a valued long-term supporter of the museum and our current partnership runs until this year\u201d. BP did not respond to a request for comment.While the most recent five-year deal with BP was always due to expire this month, campaigners have feared that the museum\u2019s ambitious \u201cRosetta project\u201d renovation plans, for which it needs to find \u00a31bn in funding, might lead to a renewal of the sponsorship, even if in a less high-profile form. More details of the masterplan are expected to be revealed later this year.The disclosures were obtained by the group Culture Unstained, which campaigns against fossil fuel funding of the arts and has been among the most vocal critics of the BP partnership during a decade of high-profile protests at the museum.Chris Garrard, the group\u2019s co-director, said: \u201cAccording to the museum\u2019s own contract with BP, the current sponsorship [has] ended \u2026 so what is it now trying to hide? Either it is stage-managing the exit of a polluting sponsor that it should be roundly rejecting or it has made the indefensible decision to allow BP to remain a partner of the museum, and to continue selling the oil and gas firm social legitimacy while it makes massive profits from conflict and climate crisis.\u201cThe museum director has a duty to be open, honest and accountable \u2013 he must give clarity on where the museum stands.\u201dBP is one of the longest-standing financial backers of the British Museum, having supported its public programme since 1996. Their most recent contract was signed in 2016 and came into effect in 2018 as part of a five-year block sponsorship deal that also included three other major arts organisations \u2013 the Royal Shakespeare Company, National Portrait Gallery and Royal Opera House.All three others have now ended their relationships with BP, while many other cultural organisations have also severed ties with the company and other fossil fuel sponsors. Garrard said now was \u201cthe ideal moment for the museum to join the rest of the culture sector in walking decisively away from fossil fuel funding\u201d.Environmental activists have campaigned relentlessly against the museum\u2019s relationship with BP, while climate scientists, archaeologists and figures in the arts, as well as British Museum members and staff, have decried the fossil fuel sponsorship.",

They will learn from this, and from Tree\u2019s article, what a wild gardener really is.We concentrate on improving habitats for wildlife, so we nurture everything from piles of leaves to swift boxes, ponds to hedges, climbing plants to dry walls. We may leave fruit on our bushes, stands of nettle by our ponds, ivy on our shrubs and trees. We will be as busy as conventional gardeners in autumn, cutting back, taking cuttings, clearing paths. But we will pile up our leaves, or use them as mulch.Our plants will go to seed and fruit. Seeds and fruits from our plants will be available all year round for birds and insects, not just nectar in summer. We tend to use hand tools, not strimmers or leaf blowers. We tend to make compost, and don\u2019t use peat or pesticides. Our gardens are beautiful and well-maintained. We often get involved with other land managers, such as churches and farmers, to try to promote wild spaces and reduce pesticides.Our village now has an annual prize for the best wild garden, and we have noted an increase in the sightings of hedgehogs, slowworms, frogs, toads and bats. Wild gardeners are a tolerant lot. It is a distressing sign of the times that the multimillion gardening industry feels the need for its attack dogs to savage us.Carol KuhlmannSt Dogmaels Wild Gardeners Group Isabella Tree\u2019s article makes valid points about what rewilding is, not least the importance of using exotic plants, recognising that our arguably impoverished native flora and plant succession without intervention leads to reduced biodiversity. But was the obvious hostility to Monty Don and Alan Titchmarsh necessary? The former is constantly promoting and innovating new ways to support wildlife diversity and mitigate the impact of climate change.What both Don and Titchmarsh would recognise is the individuality of our gardens, whether back gardens, balconies, allotments or other community garden spaces. They provide essential wellbeing places for us and wildlife to enjoy.We have been developing our own small wildflower meadow for 10 years from an ordinary lawn outside our 1930s semi-detached house. An advocacy and approach is needed that engages with us all in all our different garden spaces and their uses, not setting up a needless adversarial contest. Lloyd Snellgrove and Julie WestfoldSheffield It\u2019s interesting how the term rewilding elicits such passionate objection by some horticulturists. I\u2019ve been establishing and maintaining rewilded gardens for more than 40 years \u2013 mostly small to medium suburban gardens. Back in the 1980s, the buzz phrase was \u201chabitat creation\u201d. In the 90s and 00s, \u201cpermaculture\u201d was the new thing. It focused on garden food production and support for wildlife in a more natural, woodland\u2011edge\u2011style landscape. At the risk of upsetting the permaculture purists, this used to be called \u201ccottage gardening\u201d.Now that we have the term rewilding, I have new ways to explain to customers that the seasonal mowing and scything I need to do to keep an area as meadow mimics the work of grazers (cattle etc) and that the pruning I do to give space to each shrub or tree is the work of browsers (deer etc). And when I need to fork out some invasive species, it is mimicking the work of rooting pigs.I agree with Isabella Tree that the monoculture lawn is one of the greatest insults to nature. Surely plastic grass, the widespread use of weed\u2011suppressing membranes and hard surfacing have to come a close second. Given that in the UK we have approx 4,330 sq km of private gardens, how we as individuals choose to support biodiversity really does make a difference.Kathleen AskewHayling Island, Hampshire Isabella Tree\u2019s article highlights the need for the adoption of a more accurate term for the intensive land management that is needed to generate and sustain complex ecologies. \u201cFarming and gardening for wildlife\u201d might not have the same appeal as \u201crewilding\u201d, but it does emphasise that both are processes that require much more than sitting back and letting nature take its, often limited, course.James DriverChiddingfold, Surrey Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

Mountain Valley has just 20 miles (30km) left to complete but is several years behind schedule due to opposition from green groups and nearby residents who risk having their land taken for the project.However, Joe Manchin, the West Virginia senator, coal baron and the Senate\u2019s leading beneficiary of campaign donations from gas pipeline interests, has vigorously lobbied for the pipeline\u2019s construction and appears to have prevailed in his quest. Manchin, a centrist Democrat, is considered a valued swing vote in an evenly divided Senate.\u201cI am pleased speaker [Kevin] McCarthy and his leadership team see the tremendous value in completing the [Mountain Valley pipeline] to increase domestic energy production and drive down costs across America and especially in West Virginia,\u201d Manchin said in a statement that did not mention Biden. \u201cI am proud to have fought for this critical project and to have secured the bipartisan support necessary to get it across the finish line.\u201dThe White House has framed the debt ceiling deal as one that has protected Biden\u2019s key climate achievements, such as the numerous provisions for clean energy support in last year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which Republicans were keen to strip away in negotiations.But the agreement does not include any measures to accelerate the expansion of electricity transmission, a crucial factor in whether the shift to renewables will actually materialize, while acceding to Republican demands to curtail the environmental reviews of developments such as oil and gas pipelines.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This has raised hopes that healthy reefs can still thrive at a time when coral is in crisis due to record sea surface temperatures and ocean acidification. It also showed the effectiveness of conservation actions and effective management, they said.\u201cThey are pristine and teeming with life \u2013 pink octopus, batfish, squat lobsters and an array of deep-sea fish, sharks and rays,\u201d said Dr Michelle Taylor, a marine biologist at Essex University and co-leader of the expedition in a human-occupied vehicle, HOV Alvin, a submersible able to take two scientists to depths of 6,500 metres.HOV Alvin being lowered into the Gal\u00e1pagos marine reserve.

It could also help understand the role of MPAs in the carbon cycle and fisheries. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely there are more reef structures across different depths waiting to be explored,\u201d he said.A sea urchin on a coral with fossil coral, the foundation of the live reef, in the background.

Chile is the only high-income nation in the top 15 countries.\u201cThe global south countries are generally not high per-capita greenhouse-gas emitters,\u201d Beagley said. \u201cAs major global polluters, it is crucial for G20 countries to embed air-quality considerations into their [nationally determined contributions], yet no G20 government even scores half-marks \u2013 indicative of lack of recognition of the links between climate and air quality, or ambition to take action.\u201dThe GCHA ranking compares 169 countries and the EU on their progress towards integrating air-quality considerations into their national climate action plans. It is aimed at assessing \u201cthe extent to which governments\u2019 national climate commitments recognise and contribute to ensuring healthy air for communities around the world\u201d.Countries were scored on five categories, including health impacts. Bahrain, North Korea, Nauru, Palau, Saudi Arabia and the Solomon Islands are at the bottom of the list of countries, with zero points out of 15.Colombia \u201crecognises the importance of protecting health (including respiratory health specifically) through air-quality action, and of monitoring these gains\u201d, according to the analysis, while Mali \u201cnotes that black carbon contributes to negative impacts on human health\u201d and \u201cthat improvements in air quality could avoid 2.4 million premature deaths by 2030\u201d.The scoring system, for the most part, is about pledges, future plans and targets made by countries, rather than steps that have been taken. Neither does it take into account other wider policies at national level, or plans submitted to the UN.Air pollution is responsible for up to 7 million deaths annually, contributing to non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, stroke, respiratory conditions and some cancers.Jeni Miller, GCHA\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cThis December, the Cop28 presidency has the opportunity to put air pollution firmly on the agenda and to catalyse national commitments and international funding to improve air quality.\u201cCop28\u2019s commitment to be the first \u2018health Cop\u2019 will turn out to be an empty promise if the conference does not deliver substantive progress in tackling air pollution as one of the most tangible issues at the nexus of climate and health.\u201d",

The government said automatic flood warnings did not compromise safety, and pointed out that the risk of floods was currently low.Wednesday\u2019s strike is the second time in a month that Environment Agency workers have stopped work over pay. Last November, the government permitted the agency to grant staff an average 3% pay rise, but their trade union, Unison, says since 2010 its members\u2019 salaries have fallen by more than 20% in real terms.Lack of investment could leave 600,000 English properties at risk of floodingRead moreUnison said a recent survey found more than a quarter of Environment Agency staff were considering leaving in the coming year. Of these, more than half (54%) said their main reason for wanting to quit was inadequate pay.Agency workers have said staff shortages were increasing pressure on those still working at the agency, while low pay had forced some to resort to food banks. Tom, an Environment Agency worker in the south-east, described the November pay award as insulting and said staff felt undervalued and disrespected.\u201cBecause of the low pay there are real problems recruiting staff,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means we\u2019re expected to cover vacant posts and do more for less money. The cost of my mortgage has gone up by hundreds of pounds a month, on top of skyrocketing fuel bills and food costs. I\u2019m struggling to make ends meet.\u201dWorkers have been staging work-to-rule actions since December and had their first full strike day in January. The latest strike comes after a 12-hour period of action short of strike, in which staff withdrew from emergency incident rotas. It will be followed by a further 12-hour period of the same.Discussions over pay have taken place, but Environment Agency workers are considered to be civil servants and so are affected by a wider 2% pay rise cut across the civil service.Unison said Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the environment secretary, had still not sat down with workers\u2019 representatives. \u201cMinisters are simply ignoring this invisible workforce,\u201d said Christina McAnea, the general secretary of Unison.\u201cThe public might not see what they do, but day in day out, they work tirelessly behind the scenes keeping communities safe from the ravages of the weather, rogue companies polluting rivers and criminals blighting the landscape with illegal fly-tipping.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They also reported a lack of social contact, so were less able to discuss problems with peers.Rural areas also face relative poverty, and farmers have had to face particular stresses recently, the report says, including unpredictable weather and animal health crises. The report has found the UK farming community has lower levels of mental wellbeing than the population at large.MPs also highlighted changing and uncertain government policies that can affect their incomes as well as mental health. Respondents said uncertainty around the new environmental land management schemes, which replace EU subsidies for farmers, has led to mental distress.They have called for a more joined-up approach, pointing out that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) does not seem to have prioritised rural mental health in its policies.The report says: \u201cDefra is clearly responsible for working with the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) to ensure mental health policy and services are rural proofed, it is unclear what priority, resources and energy Defra has assigned to achieving impact in this area.\u201d They recommend that the two departments work on a rural mental health policy.The MPs said Defra, DHSC, the NHS and the Department for Transport should set out rural transport policies that provide rural communities with access to health services as good as the access urban communities enjoy.The chair of the environment, food and rural affairs committee, Sir Robert Goodwill, said: \u201cRural communities face a unique set of challenges.

The installations are concentrated in the country\u2019s north and north-west provinces, such as Shanxi, Xinjiang and Hebei.\u2018Insanely cheap energy\u2019: how solar power continues to shock the worldRead moreIn addition, the group identified solar farms under construction that could add another 379GW in prospective capacity, triple that of the US and nearly double that of Europe.China has also made huge strides in wind capacity: its combined onshore and offshore capacity now surpasses 310GW, double its 2017 level and roughly equivalent to the next top seven countries combined. With new projects in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu and along coastal areas, China is on course to add another 371GW before 2025, increasing the global wind fleet by nearly half.\u201cThis new data provides unrivalled granularity about China\u2019s jaw-dropping surge in solar and wind capacity,\u201d said Dorothy Mei, a project manager at Global Energy Monitor. \u201cAs we closely monitor the implementation of prospective projects, this detailed information becomes indispensable in navigating the country\u2019s energy landscape.\u201dThe findings are in line with previous reports and government data released this year, which predicted that China could easily surpass its target of supplying a third of its power consumption through renewable sources by 2030.China\u2019s green energy drive is part of its effort to meet dual carbon goals set out in 2020. As the world\u2019s second largest economy, it is the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and accounts for half of the world\u2019s coal consumption.

Named Kela, the plant can produce 2bn kW hours of electricity annually, equal to the energy consumption of more than 700,000 households.It is only the first phase of a massive clean energy project in the Yalong River basin.

In recent years, record heatwaves and drought crippled hydropower stations, resulting in power crunches that brought factories to a halt. An outdated electricity grid and inflexibility in transferring energy between regions add to the uncertainty.The Kela plant is located in the sparsely populated west of the country, where more than three-quarters of coal, wind and solar power is generated. But the vast majority of energy consumption happens in the east. Transporting energy thousands of miles across the country results in inefficiencies.The way China\u2019s grid is organised can incentivise building coal plants around renewable generators. Much of the new renewable capacity is not connected to the local energy supply and often bundled with coal power to be transmitted to areas of higher demand.More coal power was approved in the first three months of 2023 than in the whole of 2021.\u201cChina is making strides,\u201d said Martin Weil, a researcher at Global Energy Monitor and an author of the report. \u201cBut with coal still holding sway as the dominant power source, the country needs bolder advancements in energy storage and green technologies for a secure energy future.\u201d",

However, the new study suggests cleaning up the air can bring improvements.\u201cThat\u2019s a strong message to policymakers and city planners that actions to decrease air pollution level and exposure will pay off in the long term, definitely, for children and across the life course,\u201d said Prof Erik Mel\u00e9n, paediatrician and professor at the department of clinical research and education, Karolinska Institutet, who co-authored the new study.Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, whose daughter Ella died from air pollution 10 years ago, viewing an artwork projection at London\u2019s South Bank \u2013 Breathe For Ella, by Dryden Goodwin. Photograph: David Parry/PAWriting in the European Respiratory Journal, Mel\u00e9n and colleagues note that lung function typically grows rapidly during adolescence, before reaching a peak by the early 20s. However, people experiencing reduced growth are potentially at higher risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as adults.Mel\u00e9n and colleagues analysed data collected as part of a wider study in which a cohort of children in Stockholm born between 1994 and 1996 were followed up from birth to the age of 24, with measurements of lung function collected at age eight, 16 and 24. Crucially, said Mel\u00e9n, the research did not focus on particular populations, such as those with asthma or who only lived in highly polluted areas. \u201cThis is real-life data,\u201d he said.By analysing the measurements of 1,509 participants for which lung function data was available at eight years old and at least one subsequently timepoint, the team was able to track their lung function development. They then used participants\u2019 addresses to estimate their exposure to air pollution over time, including particulate matter known as PM2.5 and PM10, as well as black carbon and nitrogen oxides.Overall, although not for all participants, long-term air pollution exposure levels decreased over the study period \u2013 a finding Mel\u00e9n said could be down to a number of factors, including a more modern car fleet, the rise of electric vehicles, and traffic restrictions.After taking into account lung growth expected as a result of adolescence, as well as factors such as smoking, parental education and air pollution exposure in the first year of life, the team found that reductions in air pollution were associated with an increased growth rate of participants\u2019 lung function. For example, the mean growth rate in forced expiratory volume in one second increased by 4.63mL a year for each 2.19 \u03bcg/m3 decrease in PM2.5.\u201cWe estimate that this [equates to a] couple of percent [improvement in lung function growth rate] over a 10-year period,\u201d said Mel\u00e9n. While he said the increase was not huge on an individual level, over a longer period the impact could be large, while it also meant fewer children would fall below the bar of normal lung function.Compared with those having no air pollution decrease, participants who experienced a 2.19 \u03bcg/m3 decrease in PM2.5 would have a 20% lower risk of having clinically impaired lung function, the team said.\u201cWith better air quality, we reduce the risk of children [having] \u2026 clinically impaired lung function. That\u2019s indeed important because those patients end up in my clinic as a paediatrician,\u201d said Mel\u00e9n. \u201cIn the long run, any incremental improvement in lung function will have a positive effect on the risk of acquiring chronic diseases in adulthood, or even life expectancy.\u201d",

        "text": "The swimming pools, well-watered gardens and clean cars of the rich are driving water crises in cities at least as much as the climate emergency or population growth, according to an analysis.The researchers said the vast difference in water use between rich and poor citizens had been largely overlooked in seeking solutions to water shortages, with the focus instead on attempts to increase supply and higher prices for water. They said the only way to protect water supplies was by redistributing water resources more equally.The study used Cape Town in South Africa as a case study and found the richest people used 50 times more water than the poorest. When the Day Zero water crisis struck the city in 2018, after several years of drought, the poorest were left without enough water for their basic needs, the scientists said.Cape Town was far from unique, the researchers said, with similar problems in many cities around the world. Since 2000, more than 80 big cities had experienced extreme drought and water shortages, they said, including Miami, Melbourne, London, Barcelona, S\u00e3o Paulo, Beijing, Bengaluru and Harare.The researchers said urban water crises were expected to become more frequent, with more than 1 billion city dwellers expected to experience water shortages in the near future. In March, a report by the Global Commission on the Economics of Water concluded that the world faces an imminent water crisis, with demand expected to outstrip supply by 40% by 2030.Prof Hannah Cloke, at the University of Reading, UK, and co-author of the new study, said: \u201cClimate change and population growth mean that water is becoming a more precious resource in big cities, but we have shown that social inequality is the biggest problem for poorer people getting access to water for their everyday needs.\u201cOur projections show this crisis could get worse as the gap between the rich and the poor widens in many parts of the world. Ultimately, everyone will suffer the consequences unless we develop fairer ways to share water in cities.\u201dThe study, published in the journal Nature Sustainability, used data to develop a model of city water use that took account of different income levels. In Cape Town, it found the richest group \u2013 14% of the city\u2019s population \u2013 used 51% of the water consumed in the city. In contrast, the poorest group \u2013 62% of the population \u2013 used just 27% of the water. Most of the water used the richest group was for non-basic needs.The model, which could be applied to other cities, showed that changes in water use by the richest group had a bigger impact on overall water availability than changes in population or droughts related to the climate crisis. The researchers also said increased use of private boreholes in times of shortage by the richest citizens substantially depleted groundwater resources.The scientists said failing to account for social inequality in a water crisis often led to technocratic solutions that simply reproduced the uneven and unsustainable water use patterns that contributed to the water crisis in the first place.Prof Mariana Mazzucato, at University College London, UK, and a lead author of the report from the Global Commission on the Economics of Water, said: \u201cWe need a much more proactive, and ambitious, common good approach [to the water crisis]. We have to put justice and equity at the centre of this, it\u2019s not just a technological or finance problem.\u201dThe new analysis quoted the conclusion of a 2016 report that said: \u201cFor most of the world, the era of cheap and plentiful drinking water has passed.\u201dCloke and her colleagues added: \u201cIt is time to agree about how society should share life\u2019s most essential natural resource.\u201d",

Statements that said gas was \u201caround 50% cleaner than coal for generating electricity\u201d now read \u201cgas produced fewer emissions than coal when used to generate electricity\u201d. Videos containing the claim have also been taken out of circulation.Experts have previously told the Guardian that in Australia\u2019s main electricity grid gas has 61% of the emissions of coal, not 50%. They also point out that coal-fired power is not being replaced by gas in Australia, but by renewables such as solar and wind.The Guardian asked Appea to respond to the concerns raised in the ACCC complaint and to the findings of the AdStandards panel.Samantha McCulloch, Appea\u2019s chief executive, said she believed the advertising was \u201cclear and factual\u201d and the association did not agree with the panel\u2019s finding.\u201cThe fact that gas produces around 50% less carbon dioxide emissions than coal when used for power generation is widely established and recognised by leading authorities including the International Energy Agency (IEA), the US Government\u2019s Energy Information Administration (EIA), the US Department of Energy and Australia\u2019s former chief scientist, Dr Alan Finkel, in his review of the National Electricity Market.\u201cHowever, out of respect for the decision and the process, APPEA promptly updated some campaign material when the decision was brought to our attention to take into account the determination.\u201d",

The levy will fund research into sustainability for the industry and establish the infrastructure for textile recycling.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nAccording to four sources close to the scheme, Kmart\u2019s opposition came after an 18-month consultation process with the AFC.Shortly before the scheme\u2019s launch on 7 June, Kmart Group asked the environment minister to cancel the scheme\u2019s impending announcement, the sources said.The discount retailer requested a six-month delay so it could create its own report on the matter and wanted the voluntary levy imposed by the scheme to be reduced or calculated based on a garment\u2019s value instead of the number of units sold, according to the sources.Kmart also lobbied other companies, including Country Road Group, to withdraw support for the scheme, the sources said. The Country Road Group declined to comment.A Kmart Group spokesperson said the retailer would welcome a regulated scheme which it believed would ensure monies raised are spent on recycling clothes rather than funding roles.\u201cKmart Group supports the introduction of a regulated extended product responsibility scheme.

In August, they reported annual revenue of $10.6bn, while parent company Wesfarmers, which also owns hardware chain Bunnings, reported revenue of $43.6bn.Every year, 1.42bn items of clothing arrive in Australia and approximately two-thirds are thrown away. Just 7,000 tonnes of textiles are downcycled, whereby products are broken down, into insulation, pellets or board.

They spend the majority of their lives in these systems, leaving them unable to exhibit normal behaviours.The RSPCA has accused the government of a \u201crace to the bottom for animal welfare standards\u201d as conventional battery systems were banned in the UK in 2012. The CPTPP trade deal is due to be signed on 16 July, and campaigners are calling for the government to disallow eggs not produced to UK animal welfare standards.David Bowles, the head of public affairs at the RSPCA, said: \u201cIf this deal is agreed, it will not only set our own egg producers at a disadvantage, it will also directly impact RSPCA standards on laying hens, which account for over one in two eggs produced in the UK. The government is starting the gun on a race to the bottom for our animal welfare standards.\u201dEgg products could be imported from countries such as Mexico, which relies almost exclusively on battery cages for egg production. Such imports would undercut British egg producers who operate to significantly higher standards of animal welfare under the British Lion code of practice.Dr Nick Palmer, the head of Compassion in World Farming UK, added: \u201cWithout adequate tariffs to only allow imported eggs produced to UK standards, the doors will be wide open for powdered and liquid eggs from countries with lower or no animal welfare standards \u2013 this is not what UK consumers expect of our government, which promotes high standards of hen welfare, environmental protection and food safety.\u201dThere have recently been concerns about the egg supply chain, after bird flu and costs caused farms to go out of business. From late last year, there were egg shortages in supermarkets, with some sourcing eggs from Italy.The chief executive of the British Egg Industry Council, Mark Williams, said: \u201cIt is almost unbelievable that the government would let consumers down like this. Shoppers will be horrified to learn that eggs in their food products could soon be coming from battery cages more than a decade after they were banned here.\u201cTo rubberstamp a deal which effectively sanctions the importation of eggs from conventional (battery) caged systems which are outlawed here is not only counter-intuitive, but it also completely undermines the countrywide standards that are adhered to by the UK egg industry. This particularly affects the egg products sector which could see the importation of low welfare eggs, whilst UK egg farmers rightly continue to invest in ensuring higher welfare standards for their birds.\u201dThe CPTPP trade deal with Canada, Mexico and other countries has caused concern among animal welfare campaigners as there is also the possibility of low-welfare pork being imported. In Canada, there are more than 7,400 pig farms, and animal charities in the country say pigs there face castration, ear notching, tail docking and teeth trimming. Sows are kept for long periods in stalls that do not give them room to turn around, a practice banned in the UK. Pigs are also often left to live on cold, damp, slatted floors with no room for bedding or straw, the campaigners say.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cWe are committed to protecting high animal welfare standards globally, as the prime minister recently emphasised in open letter to British farmers. We have not lowered our food, animal welfare or environmental standards in order to accede to CPTPP and there have been no imports of eggs from CPTPP members to the UK since 2015.\u201cGlobal trade flows on shell eggs are minimal as it is not practical to trade shell eggs for human consumption over long distances and exports of egg products are not significant within the CPTPP membership.\u201d",

Five of the six most hazardous years occurred between 2010 and 2020.Climate change predicted to halve coffee-growing area that supports 120m peopleRead moreThe optimal growing temperatures for the two major coffee varieties, arabica and robusta, are 18 to 22C and 22 to 28C.The researchers found that between 1980 and 2020, growing regions were more prone to experiencing too-cold temperatures. \u201cThe current climate, however, is characterised by too-hot conditions in every region,\u201d they found, adding that \u201cthe vast majority of coffee regions never experience too-cold growing season temperatures\u201d.The study\u2019s lead author, Dr Doug Richardson, who completed the research while at the CSIRO, said the shift from cool and wet to hot and dry conditions \u201cwe\u2019re pretty confident is a result of climate change\u201d.The researchers wrote: \u201cWith climate change projections showing a continued rise in temperatures in the tropics is likely, we suggest that coffee production can expect ongoing systemic shocks.\u201d\u201cAs with other crops, a systemic risk to the global coffee trade is posed by synchronised crop failures,\u201d they added.Previous research has shown the amount of land suitable for coffee cultivation globally could halve by 2050 due to climate change.Richardson said: \u201cIf you have a shock to the supply of coffee in any given year, if there isn\u2019t enough coffee stored from previous years, then you could expect the price to increase.\u201dThe researchers also analysed the impacts of six different climate drivers on coffee production, including the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (Enso), the planet\u2019s most significant year-to-year climate fluctuation.\u201cDuring El Ni\u00f1o events, we see a greater chance of conditions being too hot or too dry, and it\u2019s roughly the reverse for La Ni\u00f1a,\u201d Richardson said.Though El Ni\u00f1o has global effects, it seems to have less of an impact in southern Brazil, the world\u2019s largest grower for arabica beans. \u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that it\u2019s less affected by Enso,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cWhat we hope is that during El Ni\u00f1o events, suppliers from southern Brazil might be able to offset reductions [in crop] elsewhere.\u201dThe researchers found: \u201cMajor arabica regions in the far southeast of Brazil and southwest Ethiopia are amongst the least susceptible regions to climate hazards.\u201dThe 12 top coffee growers account for about 90% of global production. These include Brazil, Peru and Mexico in the Americas; Uganda and Ethiopia in Africa; and Vietnam and Indonesia in south-east Asia.",

        "text": "It\u2019s been clear during party conference season that the UK is about to enter an unprecedented culture war on climate. At the Labour conference, the question has been: is the party up to the fight?Keir Starmer is attempting to counter Rishi Sunak\u2019s doom and gloom about the supposed cost of climate action with a more optimistic message. He unveiled some long-awaited green policies, including a proposal for community renewable energy. The Labour leader also referenced the climate catastrophes that have swept the world this year, and reminded the audience \u201cclean British energy is cheaper than foreign fossil fuels\u201d.He also reiterated his commitment to keeping Britain\u2019s net zero targets, saying: \u201cWhen Rishi Sunak says roll back on our climate mission, I say speed ahead.\u201dStarmer also promised more green spaces and pointed out it was under a Labour government that the first national park was designated.Some had feared the party would join a race to the bottom, trying to match Sunak\u2019s vandalism of environmental policies. But the opposite has been true; climate underpins the policies of nearly all of those who would hold the great offices of state, and is a clear thread running through Labour\u2019s electoral strategy.The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves reiterated plans for a more extensive windfall tax on fossil fuel companies. She also countered Conservative plans to use the planning rules to make it more difficult to install onshore wind and solar, pledging to write new planning documents that enshrine net zero at their heart. Starmer also promised to \u201cbulldoze through\u201d the Tories\u2019 restrictions on onshore renewables.The next election will be a climate election, and as we saw at Conservative conference last week, fake news will be rife. It\u2019s clear Tory ministers are unafraid to make up Labour policies that don\u2019t exist, such as a meat tax, and spout outlandish claims about how much decarbonisation will allegedly cost households.The shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said: \u201cThe Tories are going to fight a very dirty and desperate campaign. For the record, we are not in favour of a meat tax. But Sunak wants to have a row about whether a clean energy future is good for the country or not. Let\u2019s bring it on. Because what he\u2019s saying is not just anti-green. It\u2019s anti-business, anti-prosperity, anti-young people.\u201dHe seems to be relishing the idea of being able to debate his favourite topic against Sunak, who clearly knows less about the subject. Miliband has linked the politics of Liz Truss and Donald Trump to the prime minister\u2019s environmental policies, and mocked falsehoods such as the idea people would be forced to have seven bins.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let these Tories cancel our country\u2019s future,\u201d he said, \u201cThe British people don\u2019t want a pound shop Republican party. They don\u2019t want an energy policy written by Truss and Trump. Let\u2019s send these Tories to where they belong. Let\u2019s recycle them from government to opposition. And chuck them into the seven dustbins of history.\u201dLabour\u2019s environment team have incorporated a social justice bent to their pitch for the rural vote. The new shadow environment secretary, Steve Reed, said that access to nature was \u201cbread and roses\u201d, and he and junior shadow minister Toby Perkins have promised to take on the big businesses that are polluting the environment and ripping off food producers.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

He referred to the claim that Labour would implement a meat tax as \u201cfake news\u201d, adding that Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s comments about wanting to import hormone injected beef from Australia are great for Labour\u2019s election chances: \u201cThey should put that on a poster: \u2018Hormone injected beef \u2013 vote Conservative.\u2019\u201dLabour\u2019s approach this conference has been to counter Sunak\u2019s misinformation and present a positive case of its own; pledging that green policies will lower bills and bring prosperity back to Britain.\u201cLabour\u2019s task is to restore hope to our politics,\u201d Reeves told the conference on Monday.

        "text": "Over the next week, millions of trees will be ejected from homes across the UK as Christmas festivities draw to a close.But instead of sending their pine, fir and spruce trees for recycling or replanting, growing numbers of eco-conscious households are trying to make the most of them by eating various parts before throwing them out. Fir trees can be used in ice-cream, to pickle vegetables and even to flavour gin.Food experts say the needles can be used like rosemary or bay leaves in cooking to create a flavour of citrus and pine, and are also a good source of vitamin C. The wood can also be burned to make pine ash, which can be used in gardens and for cleaning as well as in the kitchen.Michelin-starred chefs are also among fans. John Williams, executive chef of the Ritz restaurant, says \u201cfragrant and spicy\u201d needles can be used to enhance the flavour of celeriac among other ingredients. Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, of three-Michelin-starred Noma in Copenhagen, told the Observer pine has been a regular fixture at his restaurant for almost 20 years.Julia Georgallis, author of How to Eat Your Christmas Tree\u201cYou can pretty much eat the whole thing,\u201d said Julia Georgallis, author of How to Eat Your Christmas Tree. \u201cYou can use the needles as you would use rosemary or bay leaves, for flavour.\u201dShe recommends wearing gloves to handle a spruce tree, as they can be quite spiky. For an even more chef-like option, she suggested making pine ash by putting sections of tree in a hot oven until charred before whizzing in a blender to create a black powder to use as flavouring.Needles can also be used to pickle eggs or vegetables and in drinks and infusions. For those who replant their trees, she recommends eating the new buds in spring.The London-based baker and food writer has been working with Christmas trees for years. When she first started, few people took any interest, she said. Since then the idea has rapidly gained traction.Her sellout Christmas tree supper club will run later this week at Host of Leyton in east London. The menu includes stuffed, deep-fried olives, carrot cured with beetroot and fir-lox, spruce ice-cream sundae, and pinenut fudge brownie served with pinenut brittle and white pine tea.While the popularity of foraging and mixology have played a role, she said, the climate crisis is the main driving force. \u201cIt\u2019s made everyone a lot more aware of how they\u2019re eating, what they\u2019re eating, how they buy and grow stuff.\u201dIt would be best for the environment not to have Christmas trees in the home at all, said Georgallis, but, for those who cannot give up the habit, the tree should be used as much as possible.Pine-flavoured pickled vegetablesA five-foot Christmas tree is probably about 12 years old, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why in a climate crisis, when trees are our best armoury, we\u2019re cutting down thousands a year to keep hostage in our houses.\u201dPine products can also be extracted from living trees. Redzepi said he started cooking with pine nearly 20 years ago, using shoots from the forest after he reading about it in a French book. \u201cWe went to the forest and stared picking pine shoots \u2013 they were incredible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe then discovered that the mature needles could add piney and citrusy notes.\u201dBut, he warned, it is vital to use only organic trees, grown without pesticides. \u201cWe only go into the wild forest, as some pine farming can be quite toxic,\u201d he said.Redzepi likes pine\u2019s versatility: \u201cThink of it as rosemary \u2013 you can use it in just about anything.\u201dOrganic pine needles can be crushed to flavour gin or vinegar, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that I think British people would very much enjoy. You can also just blend them into vinegar, for a pine flavour \u2013 that is also great.\u201d",

The admission came as she announced a new environmental plan for England that held back from banning wood-burning stoves and settled instead for \u201ceducating\u201d people on their use.The Times subsequently reported that the government would encourage councils to use their powers to issue householders \u00a3300 on-the-spot fines for flouting air pollution rules by burning logs at home.But the Green party co-leader Carla Denyer said the government should go further and potentially end the sale of log burners.She said: \u201cLocal authorities have powers to create smoke control areas in cities under the Environment Act 2021. This goes some way to preventing homeowners and businesses releasing smoke from a chimney. However, there are exemptions for particular stoves and fuels which still mean dangerous particulates can be released into the atmosphere.My burning shame: I fitted my house with three wood-burning stoves | George MonbiotRead more\u201cWe need an urgent review into the impacts of smoke from chimneys on public health in high-density housing areas, with a view to putting an end to future sales of log burners and fuels if they are shown to have an unacceptable detrimental impact.\u201dThe environment charity ClientEarth, which has won pollution cases against the government, has said the burners need to be phased out. Andrea Lee, from the charity, said: \u201cPollution from wood-burning is a growing source of fine particulate matter pollution in some areas, which is a serious threat to people\u2019s health.\u201dThe Liberal Democrats have called for more powers for local councils to stop the use of polluting burners. A spokesperson said they were disappointed that it had taken so long for the ban on house coal and wet wood to come through.\u201cThe new eco-design has reduced air pollution from wood burners but more needs to be done including encouraging households to replace older wood burners with the new design. We believe local authorities should have more powers to tackle air pollution in their areas,\u201d the spokesperson said.Under the 2021 Environment Act, councils have powers to issue on-the-spot civil penalties of up to \u00a3300. The government\u2019s plans to encourage councils to take action mean that criminal prosecutions could be pursued for the most persistent offenders, resulting in a fine of up to \u00a35,000 plus a further \u00a32,500 for each day a breach continues afterwards.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Few councils have the resources to vigorously pursue this specific issue.There will also be tighter regulation of new wood burners, which in designated \u201csmoke control areas\u201d will be allowed to produce no more than 3g of smoke per hour, instead of 5g at present.Sarah MacFadyen, the head of Policy at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: \u201cWe know that burning wood and coal releases fine particulate matter \u2013 the most worrying form of air pollution for human health \u2013 which can cause people with a lung condition such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to have a potentially life-threatening attack or flare-up.\u201cIt\u2019s therefore important to consider less polluting fuel options to heat your home or cook with, especially if coal or wood is not your primary fuel source.\u201d",

        "text": "Here is a fiercely watchable thriller which had me biting my nails down to the wrists. It is inspired partly by Andreas Malm\u2019s radical eco-activist manifesto of the same title, and partly \u2013 in fact, almost pedantically \u2013 by the heist classic Reservoir Dogs. A young crew of protesters, each individually getting a backstory flashback which sometimes jumps into the drama at a cliffhanger moment, come together for the big job, knowing each other as little as Tarantino\u2019s colour-coded bad guys and having similar issues around gunshot wound injury and possible disloyalty.Director and co-screenwriter Daniel Goldhaber applies a fictional imagination to the first two words in the title of Malm\u2019s book, which argues for direct-action property destruction but is not actually a \u201chow to\u201d bomb-making guide like William Powell\u2019s 1971 gonzo classic The Anarchist Cookbook; it is still in print and still assuredly being studied by climate activists. Goldhaber\u2019s drama shows how this kind of paramilitary adventure might actually happen, month by month, moment by moment, as well as the kind of people who would be sufficiently motivated or reckless to risk decades in federal prison. They are all drawn together by a plan to blow up a west Texas oil pipeline, disrupt the flow and drive its price ruinously up.Interestingly, there is no clear leader, no one whose job is to explain to the gang (and the audience) what is going to happen, in scenes which would involve them standing in front of a whiteboard or a table with toy cars around a cardboard model. In so far as someone is in charge, it appears to be Michael (Forrest Goodluck), a bomb specialist: although the lightbulb moment of having the idea and finding the exact spot where a bomb could be planted are relatively unimportant and almost invisible.Michael is a young Native American who resents the oil rigs destroying his homeland; Xochitl (Ariela Barer) and Theo (Sasha Lane, from Andrea Arnold\u2019s American Honey) are friends affected by big oil\u2019s toxic pollution in their neighbourhood, and Theo\u2019s girlfriend Alisha (Jayme Lawson) agrees to help. Dwayne (Jake Weary) is a Texan good ol\u2019 boy and open-carry gun enthusiast who resents the government requisitioning his land, Shawn (Marcus Scribner) is disillusioned with the virtue-signalling futility of making documentary films about climate change, and Logan (Lukas Gage) and Rowan (Kristine Froseth) are seasoned campaigners.A regular heist movie is driven by cynicism and greed, undercut with a crime-doesn\u2019t-pay anxiety; this film is therefore fundamentally unlike Tarantino\u2019s, but it is also unlike say, Gillo Pontecorvo\u2019s The Battle of Algiers from 1966 which shows the insurgents\u2019 revolutionary motivation sympathetically, but without overtly asking the audience to share it. Another comparison might be Fred Zinnemann\u2019s 1973 adaptation of Frederick Forsyth\u2019s novel The Day of the Jackal, which presented us with the hitman\u2019s thrillingly ice-cold professionalism in the (paid) service of a cause. Here, the pipeline destroyers are the good guys; an interesting genre twist though one which arguably defangs the film, just a little, removing the addictive flavour of cruelty and chaos, yet not making it any the less gripping and ingenious. How to Blow Up a Pipeline is released on 21 April in UK and Irish cinemas.",

        "text": "Name: Fish tanks.Age: The first aquariums date to the middle of the 19th century.Appearance: A rectangular glass box, filled with water, plants and lots of colourful tropical fish.Sounds lovely. No, it\u2019s bad.How can having a fish tank be bad? It\u2019s environmentally bad.Just one fish tank? It\u2019s not just one. About 4 million households in the UK have pet fish and about 70% of those keep tropical freshwater fish.But how much environmental harm can an aquarium cause? As much as riding a motorbike.How would you even begin to measure that? According to a study by Cardiff University, transporting tropical fish, running a pump and heating a 400-litre tank creates the equivalent of 635kg of CO2 a year.Is that a lot? It\u2019s the same as travelling 3,483 miles on a motorbike, or 2,265 miles in an average petrol car, according to official data.I don\u2019t understand. Is the aquarium in the car with me? These figures are just for comparison.Then let\u2019s compare like for like. Do tropical fish generate more CO2 than other pets? In many cases, yes. Keeping your standard meat-eating cat produces only about 250kg of CO2 a year \u2013 and you can reduce that by feeding them fish.Does your calculation include leaving the TV on for them, which I do while I\u2019m at work? You leave the TV on for your fish?No, for my cats. But, coincidentally, they do like programmes about fish. That will add to the total. But cats and fish are nowhere near as damaging as dogs.You\u2019re telling me. My sister\u2019s dog ate an entire duvet. I meant environmentally \u2013 a recent study estimated that feeding wet food to a medium-sized dog for a year would account for 6,541kg of CO2, the equivalent of about 14 round-trip flights in Europe.And dry food? Just 828kg, which is better, but still worse than the fish.Is there anything aquarium enthusiasts can do to mitigate the impact of their hobby? They could downsize. A 400-litre tank is huge; about 1.5 metres (5ft) wide. A 50-litre tank would be responsible for as little as 85kg of CO2 a year, which is less than using your washing machine (118kg).With all the planet-hating dog owners doing as they please, give me one good reason why I shouldn\u2019t own a 5ft aquarium. It will cost you about \u00a32,000, fish not included.That\u2019s a very good reason. What about just one goldfish in a bowl? Much cheaper \u2013 and only 25kg of CO2 a year.Do say: \u201cLeave the tropical fish in the tropics.\u201dDon\u2019t say: \u201cI got the 5ft tank secondhand. Now, choose your lobster and let\u2019s eat.\u201d",

Therefore, raising taxes on the wealthiest people and on big corporate polluters is critical to support the level of government spending required.\u201dRishi Sunak drew an angry response from campaigners and business leaders after watering down the UK\u2019s net zero policies as he sought to draw dividing lines with Labour in the run-up to the election.While promising to invest up to \u00a328bn in green jobs and industry towards the end of a first Labour term in government, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has ruled out new taxes on wealth. Labour has promised to scrap non-dom status, charge VAT on private school fees, and launch a more extensive windfall tax on energy company profits.Setting out proposals to raise billions of pounds for the exchequer to help fund the green transition, the charities said a 1-2% wealth tax on assets worth more than \u00a310m could raise up to \u00a322bn a year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "The world could fall short of food by 2050 due to falling crop yields, insufficient investment in agricultural research and trade shocks, according to Joe Biden\u2019s special envoy for food security, Dr Cary Fowler.Fowler, who is also known as the \u201cfather\u201d of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a global store of seeds for the most significant crops, said studies by agricultural economists showed the world needed to produce 50-60% more food by 2050 in order to feed its growing population. But crop yields rates were projected to decline by between 3-12% as a result of global heating.\u201cWe\u2019re going to fall fairly short of being able to provide that kind of increase in food production by mid-century,\u201d Fowler said.In the new gold rush, farmers are asked to decide between food, carbon and renewable energy \u2013 but we need them all | Gabrielle ChanRead moreAsked by Guardian Australia whether he described the situation as an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d, Fowler replied: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty close to it, isn\u2019t it?\u201dFowler was in Canberra on Tuesday to give the keynote address at the Crawford Fund\u2019s annual conference. The title for the conference is Global Food Security in a Riskier World.He was appointed to the role of special envoy by Biden in 2022. His previous roles include with the Global Crop Diversity Trust and the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nFowler said Australian agriculture had much to offer globally in research and development around food security in a warming, drying climate, having built a world-leading industry despite poor soils and a challenging climate. The growing industry around Indigenous crops had also attracted global interest.But he warned that many countries had become lax about the challenge ahead off the back of huge gains in productivity that saw a massive increase in food production in the past century.\u201cWe are in the midst of a global food crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cMore than 700 million people were undernourished in 2022 compared to 613 million in 2019. It\u2019s an incomprehensibly large number and a human tragedy. Every country is affected, including countries like Australia, but especially the most vulnerable around the world.\u201dThe crisis has been exacerbated by supply chain disruption from the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, high fertiliser prices and low grain supplies on hand. Given 131 of 196 countries in the world were net food importers, Fowler said, any shocks to a global system would immediately impact trade.Australians urged to prepare for most significant bushfire season since black summerRead more\u201cAs a result of all of those things, a number of countries took action to restrict trade, and that made the problem even worse,\u201d he said.\u201cBecause typically, trade is how you make up for short-term deficits in your own production. So if you ask the question of what the causes are, then you have to look at climate, stockpiles, trade and conflict.\u201dFowler said countries needed to increase their investment in agricultural research, including on longer-term \u201cmoonshot\u201d projects with no near-term payoffs. The United States agricultural research and development budget was at the same level it was 50 years ago, when taking into account inflation.\u201cMany developed countries, and I put the United States in that category, have \u2026 fallen behind China in terms of public investment in agricultural R&D,\u201d he said.While some of that research funding had been picked up by the private sector, he said, in recent years much of that was focused on developing and marketing new food and beverage products rather than public sector plant-breeding programs, or the effects of drought or climate change on food production crops.\u201cAll dollars are not invested equally, if we are trying to fix those outcomes.\u201d\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community\n",

Global climate breakdown caused by the burning of fossil fuels is causing more unpredictable and extreme weather events and the domestic infrastructure is underfunded and cannot cope sufficiently.The practical consequences of increased flooding and a lack of investment in defences include rising numbers of people being stuck in homes they cannot insure, let alone sell, businesses suffering in the autumn and winter seasons, food production facing devastating hits, transport routes becoming unusable at times. And more people will die.This week, Storm Henk followed Agnes, Babet and Debi, which came earlier in the winter and caused destruction of their own.

All that extra water is running straight off the landscape and our rivers are swelling up like the beautiful monsters they can be.\u201cMild, warmer winters, heavier downpours of rain, and storms that hit us week after week are all examples of the impacts of climate change that are increasingly affecting the UK right now. This should be a reminder of the need to adapt our cities and infrastructure to deal with this hotter, more hazardous climate. It shows a small taste of the enormous costs we are building up in the years ahead if we fail to bring down emissions fast enough.\u201dThis winter it was revealed by the National Audit Office that the number of properties to receive better protection from flooding by 2027 has been cut by 40%, and 500 of 2,000 new flood defence projects have been abandoned. The government claims the cuts are unavoidable due to high inflation, but it is likely to be more costly to rebuild flood-devastated areas than to protect them in the first place.Temporary flood defences in place in Bewdley, Worcestershire, in October last year. Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianGuardian research has found that more than 4,000 of England\u2019s vital flood defences are so damaged they are almost useless. The number of damaged flood defences has increased across all regions in the past five years.The answer is not just found in concrete defences and sandbags. There is increasing evidence that the way rivers have been straightened and deepened, and their banks stripped of vegetation, has caused water to flow down to the towns and cities below, worsening the flooding. Stripping nutrients from the soil means it is less able to hold water. Restoring river habitats and creating new floodplains would both help nature and reduce flooding.The rest of January is forecast to be more settled but clear skies should not bring complacency \u2013 the next downpours will return soon enough.",

The government needs to act now to build climate resilience in the most vulnerable regions on the planet and open up safe and legal visa routes for those fleeing environmental disasters,\u201d said the report\u2019s co-author, Ted Christie-Miller.Despite the hardline rhetoric on the illegal immigration bill by the home secretary, Suella Braverman, the authors suggest that welcoming a limited number of climate refugees would be consistent with the government\u2019s approach.London last summer was the trailer for a climate disaster movie. Here\u2019s how to stop that coming true | Sadiq Khan and Chris SkidmoreRead moreThe United Nations high commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has reported that an average of 21.5 million people were forcibly displaced each year by sudden onset extreme weather events between 2008 and 2016.Citing the UK\u2019s recent acceptance of thousands of Ukrainian refugees and Hongkongers through bespoke visa routes, the report calls for the introduction of a natural disaster visa scheme.With major floods and droughts already becoming more prevalent as a result of global heating, the authors suggest such a route could allow for a limited number of people displaced by climate events to flee to the UK.These refugees could be permitted to stay temporarily in the UK to earn money to rebuild their lives \u2013 or potentially to remain permanently. The report does not specify how many such visas could feasibly be issued.Polling carried out for the thinktank suggests such a measure might find only limited support among the public, however: 29% of people agreed the UK has a moral obligation to host people displaced by the climate crisis, against 41% who did not. Among 2019 Conservative voters, support was just 21%, with 55% against.Separately, Onward suggests migration could form part of the answer to ensuring the UK has the skills necessary to meet the government\u2019s target of hitting net zero carbon emissions by 2050.The report recommends a new environmental resilience visa scheme, which would involve the UK establishing partnerships with climate-vulnerable countries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I was last there on Christmas Day \u2013 an odd day to go birding perhaps, but not here. The island\u2019s annual Bird Race, a collective effort to find as many species as possible, runs between Christmas and the new year. In 2022 we set a record: 121 species, three of which were found in this field and nowhere else.So what\u2019s this field got that makes it so popular for birds? Weeds, glorious weeds \u2013 which modern society tells us to hate. Aren\u2019t they wildflowers too? The field is a throwback to 70 years ago, to the heyday of mixed farming, when every farm had an acre of vegetables \u2013 and lots of weeds.The field that attracts a large number of birds. Photograph: David BellamyToday I make a visit. A flock of twite is busy doing the rounds. To listen to their soft, excited chatter is one of the great joys of birding. And this is the only place where you can hear them on the island this winter. They are joined by skylark, greenfinch, linnet and lesser redpoll. In five minutes I see more reed bunting than I saw throughout 2022. Yet there is something altogether more rewarding hidden here. I am hoping to see a tree sparrow.On our island, this overlooked yet handsome bird is our most threatened, thanks to our hatred of weeds. There is a very real chance that we will lose them, and soon. This weedy field of veg is supporting two tree sparrows this winter. Such is their perilous state, they caused a small twitch on Christmas Day.Today I catch only the briefest glimpse of one. Content enough, I pop into the farm shop, thank Mrs Gawne for her conservation efforts and compliment her on her weeds. If we\u2019re going to save tree sparrows, we must support farmers to provide a lot more fields like this.Economics have forced our farmers to specialise and to hate weeds, and we are losing biodiversity as a result. On our island we have 90,000 acres of grazing, yet just 45 acres of veg. This explains why most farmland birds have graphs going the wrong way, and why there\u2019s one bird I did not see today. Once common, we recently lost our yellowhammer. They would have liked these weeds. Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",

        "text": "One of the world\u2019s longest commercial trials of a seaweed supplement that the global meat industry hopes could slash methane from beef cattle has recorded much lower reductions in the potent greenhouse gas than previous studies.Putting the supplement into the diets of 40 wagyu cattle in an Australian feedlot for 300 days cut the methane they produced by 28%.The supplement was derived from the red seaweed species Asparagopsis, which has been widely promoted as being able to cut methane by more than 80%, with some experiments suggesting reductions as high as 96%.Globally, the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization estimates, methane from burping cattle \u2013 known as enteric emissions \u2013 releases about 2.1bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent a year, compared with the 37.5bn tonnes of CO2 from burning fossil fuels.But because methane is about 80 times more potent than CO2 at warming the planet over a 20-year period, cutting methane is seen as a way to slow global heating faster.The trial, reported by the red meat industry\u2019s marketing and research group Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), also found animals given the supplement ate less food and weighed 15kg less by the time they were sent for slaughter.Dr Fran Cowley, a livestock scientist at the University of New England who led the trial, said it was the longest run so far using the red seaweed.She said more research was needed to understand why the wagyu in the trial had not delivered the same level of emissions reductions as other experiments.What is methane, how much does Australia emit, and will we sign the pledge?Read moreOne factor could be the way the methane was measured in the trial, which used an open-air system in a feedlot compared with animals measured in dedicated indoor chambers.But the trial report noted that other experiments over shorter timeframes using the same open-air measurement technique had recorded higher methane reductions.\u201cThis was the biggest and longest trial so far and [the supplement] has not performed to the levels seen in the headlines people might have picked up. But that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t,\u201d Cowley said.Cowley said she thought cuts of 90% \u201cin the real world\u201d were possible but there would also be economic factors that commercial producers would have to take, such as factoring in the cost of the supplement against the market benefits of methane reductions.The seaweed was mixed in canola oil and added to the animals\u2019 feed. In this trial it was given to the animals at slightly lower concentrations than other experiments that showed much higher methane reductions.Cowley said it was also not clear why the animals on the supplement ate less food and put on weight more slowly.Accounting for the extra 35 days the animals would have taken to reach the same weight would have theoretically meant the emissions savings were cut from 28% to 19% as they would have been alive for longer, all the time emitting methane.Wagyu is considered a higher-end and more expensive beef. The trial found the seaweed supplement had no effect on the meat\u2019s properties, including flavour.Dr Rob Kinley is a pioneer of the Asparagopsis supplement and the chief scientist at FutureFeed \u2013 the Australian company that holds the intellectual property for its use globally as a livestock feed supplement.He said it was not surprising the trial had seen lower results given the differences across breeds, measuring techniques, diets of the animals and the amount of supplement given to the animals.But Kinley said it should be celebrated that the supplement was able to cut methane over such a long period and is confident other trials would deliver far higher reductions.\u201cThe golden lining is even though it was just under 30% emissions reduction, it stayed that way for 275 days \u2013 it hardly faltered at all and I was impressed by that,\u201d he said.The Australian government funds a $29m research program to test different methane-reducing livestock supplements, including red seaweed.The latest trial was financially backed by the country\u2019s biggest beef producer, the Australian Agricultural Company (AACo), which helped run the trial and provided the animals.The AACo chief executive, David Harris, said the company had anticipated bigger methane cuts but \u201creducing emissions by almost 30% is still significant\u201d.\u201cThere is no silver bullet to eliminating enteric methane emissions, but we\u2019ll keep trying and we\u2019ll discover how to make it work in our environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe important thing is that we are determined to get there.\u201dMost trials of methane-reducing supplements report emissions reductions only while animals are in the feedlot. Only 12%-15% of AACo\u2019s emissions occur while the animals are in a feedlot.An MLA spokesperson said: \u201cEach time a new research project concludes, it places another piece into the puzzle, helping us understand the various products that might incorporate Asparagopsis and also helps us to understand further questions that need to be answered.\u201d",

        "text": "Tunisia is one of the driest countries in Africa, and has just suffered three years of drought. Yet the EU sees the country as key to producing \u201cgreen hydrogen\u201d for export to Europe. The trouble is, this fuel is obtained by splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen with electricity generated by renewable sources. Tunisia has lots of sun but precious little fresh water.The only way of producing the raw material needed for green hydrogen is sucking up Mediterranean water and desalinating it. But a report last year for the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation, affiliated to Germany\u2019s green political movement, warns that this would be a dirty, energy-intensive, water-guzzling process \u2013 and put the high cost of decarbonising the rich world on to the shoulders of poorer nations.Many sun-drenched countries, especially in the Maghreb, have been sold a future as export hubs for green hydrogen. The pitch is seductive. As 1kg of hydrogen contains about three times as much energy as 1kg of petrol, it is no wonder that hydrogen is being touted as a fuel of the future. Europe\u2019s green deal, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by the end of the decade, relies on green hydrogen production in north Africa and Ukraine.Producing green hydrogen in Europe is not impossible. But it is expensive compared with fossil fuels, with even wind-based generation needing larger subsidies. Without big government support packages, it remains an open question whether European consumers would be prepared to foot the very significant price rises needed to go green in this way.Last year, the EU proposed doubling green hydrogen imports by 2030 to 10m tonnes a year. The continent\u2019s heavy industries cannot use electricity, however environmentally friendly, for all their requirements; they need fuels for high-intensity heat. So to make sure that these energy sources are less carbon-intensive, Brussels is pushing industries \u2013 such as steel or petrochemical manufacturers \u2013 to adopt green hydrogen.The benefits of such a strategy \u2013 with the desirable goal of low carbon emissions in Europe \u2013 cannot come at the cost of environmental destruction abroad. Raoudha Gafrej, one of Tunisia\u2019s top water experts, warned in the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation report that the degradation of marine ecosystems from the toxic sludge produced by desalination plants would be irreversible.Hydrogen produced by renewable energy has a role to play in future energy systems. Its \u201cgreen\u201d version can be converted to ammonia, a key feedstock for fertilisers, with other uses in shipping fuel, power generation and steelmaking. There are also significant energy losses to consider: about a third of the energy used to produce the gas through electrolysis is lost. Transporting hydrogen requires additional energy, equivalent to 10% of the energy of the fuel itself. From the perspective of African nations, as the recent Just Transition report points out, that energy could be used locally to address immediate needs rather than being directed to produce hydrogen for use in Europe.Less than 0.04% of total hydrogen production is \u201cgreen\u201d. This proportion is bound to grow as governments worldwide wager that it will play a key role in cutting carbon-heavy emissions in industries such as cement manufacturing. With the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere already at 422 parts per million (ppm) \u2013 much higher than the 350 ppm generally considered a relatively safe level \u2013 there is no scope for worsening the problem. Transitioning to net zero emissions globally should not mean the rich gain at the expense of the poor.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After 2,000 years of keeping one another at paw\u2019s length, wildcats and their domestic cousins began to interbreed about 60 years ago, a new study suggests.Doing so may have helped to protect their offspring against diseases harboured by domestic cats, but this interbreeding is now threatening the survival of wildcats as a distinct species.Domestic cats are generally considered to have descended from Near Eastern wildcats that prowled the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East back when early human farmers began storing grain. They arrived in Britain \u2013 where European wildcats also lived \u2013 about 2,200 years ago.Today, hybridisation between wild and domestic cats is pushing the Scottish wildcat population to the brink of extinction, because the genes that define them are being \u201cswamped\u201d by those from hybrid and domestic cats.\u201cNot only are we at risk of losing a species from Britain, we\u2019re potentially replacing it with hybrid and feral domestic cats that may be not as well adapted and may not perform the same ecological role in their habitat,\u201d said Jo Howard-McCombe of the University of Bristol and the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS).\u201cIt is important to understand the history of this process, so that we can be better informed to manage that threat into the future.\u201dTo investigate when this interbreeding started, Howard-McCombe and her colleagues analysed genomic sequences from wild and domestic cats, including 48 modern felines and 258 ancient samples excavated from 85 archaeological sites over the last 8,500 years.The results, published in Current Biology, suggested that these creatures broadly avoided sexual contact with one another until the late 1950s, when rates of interbreeding between wild and domestic cats in Scotland rose rapidly \u2013 possibly as a result of dwindling wildcat populations.\u201cIf you have a population of wildcats that\u2019s being completely eradicated, those that are left are going to want to mate with something, and if the only thing that\u2019s around are domestic cats, that\u2019s probably what they\u2019re going to choose,\u201d said Prof Greger Larson at the University of Oxford, who contributed to the research.In the short term, this may have benefited their offspring: domestic cats carry diseases that can also affect wildcats, and many of the genes that have accumulated in the hybrid cats relate to immune system function. \u201cThey may have helped to prevent the acquisition of those diseases, or at least make diseases not so bad,\u201d Larson said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Today, no wild-living or captive Scottish wildcat is thought to be entirely free of domestic cat ancestry, but the descendents of a captive breeding programme initiated by RZSS during the 1960s may be the closest thing to a pure breed.Nineteen of these wildcats were recently released into a pine forest in the Scottish Highlands in the first phase of a project to rescue the species. Provided such captive-bred cats have a large enough area of wilderness to establish themselves in and breed, they should be spared the seductive lure of the domestic cat.However, to bolster their chances, Howard-McCombe advises local cat owners living nearby to get their pets neutered and vaccinated against common diseases.",

Why else would it take such a dangerous gamble on unproven technologies?\u201cSquandering taxpayers\u2019 money on nuclear reactors that don\u2019t even exist yet and fanciful carbon capture is irresponsible, and does nothing to reduce our emissions now.\u201cCommitting to \u00a320bn over 20 years is frankly pathetic compared to the green growth investments being made in the US, EU and China.\u201dHelen Clarkson, chief executive of Climate Group, said: \u201cThis spring budget overlooks cheap and clean renewable energy, and instead rebrands nuclear as \u2018environmentally sustainable\u2019 and throws cash at carbon capture technology. This was a missed opportunity to renew the UK\u2019s commitment to climate leadership.\u201dSenior nuclear industry figures said the reclassification would help attract investors to fund the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, which the government has committed \u00a3700m towards.Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, called the move a \u201chuge step forward for UK energy security and net zero\u201d.But Stuart Murphy, founder of tidal energy specialist TPGen24, said: \u201cThere is nothing environmentally sustainable about a finite resource which leaves a legacy of hazardous waste.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He also said that from July, 4m households on prepayment meters will see their bills aligned with those on direct debits, who currently pay less.The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said it expected to see taxes brought in from oil and gas firms for 2022-23 quadruple on last year to \u00a311bn, representing just a fifth of the \u00a355bn in annual global profits of British energy giants BP and Shell.The government introduced a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas operators last May. The OBR said falling wholesale gas prices meant it had cut its forecasts by \u00a34bn this year, and \u00a310bn next year, compared with forecasts made in November.The OBR also said it expects the bailout of Bulb to cost a further \u00a33bn \u201cbut much of that cost is ultimately likely to be recouped\u201d over an uncertain timeframe following the sale of the bust energy supplier to Octopus Energy.",

It\u2019s moist, flavourful and a fun use for outer cabbage leaves, which often get thrown away; it\u2019s also a wonderful vegan centrepiece for a celebratory table.Chest-nut roastThe outer leaves from a cabbage, which are all too often pulled off and discarded, are the ideal tool for wrapping a nut roast, and help keep the filling moist. Nut roast can sometimes be a little dry and unsatisfying, but this version, featuring chestnuts, has a lovely, moist texture and tastes meaty and satisfying because of thesage, nutmeg and Marmite; inspired by recipes for vegan haggis, I\u2019ve also added barley and lentils.Although delicious when fresh, I think it\u2019s even better if made a couple of days in advance, giving it time to set firmly and for the flavours to develop as they mingle. Once baked, it will keep in the fridge for up to five days, or freeze indefinitely (defrost in the fridge overnight). Reheat at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 for 30 minutes, until piping hot right through.If you have any leftovers, turn them into a rich soup: finely chop the red cabbage casing, then add to a pan with the crumbled up filling and enough boiling water to create a thick soup.

Traditional Italian salsa verde is made with parsley, capers, anchovy, garlic, vinegar and olive oil, but there are many variations on the theme, including Argentinian chimichurri, British-style mint sauce and salmoriglio, a southern Italian version made with oregano that is especially good with lamb.Coriander, too, makes all sorts of incredible sauces, among them spicy Arabian zhoug and the insanely tasty Canarian mojo verde, which I learned from Sam and Sam Clark and Marianna Leivaditaki of Moro and Morito in London when I helped set up the inaugural banquets at Wilderness Festival. It also features in their book Moro East, where it\u2019s served with papas arrugadas (or \u201cwrinkly\u201d potatoes), a dish of potatoes cooked in water so salty that, when it evaporates, they end up encrusted in salt. The sweetness of the bell peppers and the acidity of the vinegar in the lip-smacking sauce combine with the salty spuds to create an addictive flavour bomb.Coriander stalks are edible, but often get wasted, especially when a recipe calls only for the leaves or a small sprig to finish a dish. To use them as well as the leaves, just finely chop them, too.Mojo verdeThis piquant salsa transforms an abundance of stalky coriander into a sauce of dreams. Once made, the sauce will keep in the fridge for up to a week and can be used on just about anything, though it works especially well with grilled food and on Canarian papas arrugadas. To make the latter, put a layer of new potatoes in the base of a wide saucepan. Cover with water, add enough sea salt to make it taste as salty as the sea, then bring up to a boil, uncoveredand leave to cook on a medium-high heat until all the water has evaporated. Turn down the heat to medium and continue cooking until the potatoes take on a white crust \u2013 be careful, though, because the pan will get very hot \u2013 and serve with mojo verde for dipping.1 small bunch fresh coriander (100g)1 small green pepper 2 green chillies3 garlic cloves, peeled1 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp dried oregano5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil2 tbsp sherry or red-wine vinegarSea salt, to tasteRoughly chop the coriander, stalks and all.

A second site, at Inner Silver Pit South, would not be designated as the high cost to fishers would not be offset by the designation, the government said.The remaining three sites, at Allonby Bay in Cumbria, Dolphin Head in the eastern Channel and north-east of Farnes Deep, in the North Sea, will be created before 6 July this year, enabling nature to recover by banning harmful activities, including fishing, construction and dredging. They were chosen because of the ecological importance of nature recovery in the sites, the government said.In a statement announcing the decision, the environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, said: \u201cHighly protected marine areas are a vital step forward in enabling our ecosystems to thrive, increasing climate resilience and ensuring we have a healthy and productive marine environment for generations to come.\u201dA report by Lord Benyon, the former environment and fisheries minister, in 2019/20 into HPMAs recommended five sites as the \u201cbare minimum\u201d of a pilot to assess the success of the approach.Prof Callum Roberts, a marine conservationist at the University of Exeter, said the dropping of two proposed pilot sites was disappointing. \u201cIt\u2019s taken three years and eight months to get here from the Benyon report recommendation. At this rate, we\u2019ll get to 30% effective protection in 260 years.

        "text": "This week the powerful Super Typhoon Bolaven developed in the western Pacific Ocean. It began forming on Saturday and gradually strengthened as it tracked north-east, passing between Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands on Tuesday as a category 1 equivalent storm.Bolaven subsequently underwent a process known as rapid intensification, with sustained wind speeds increasing from 90mph to 160mph (145km/h to 255km/h)\u2013 the equivalent of a category 5 hurricane \u2013 in just 12 hours. It continued to strengthen into Wednesday, reaching a peak intensity of sustained winds of 180mph, making it the second strongest storm of 2023, just shy of the 185mph achieved by Super Typhoon Mawar in May.The process of rapid intensification is defined as an increase in sustained winds of 35mph within 24 hours, a mark Bolaven easily surpassed, and it was not the only tropical storm to do so this week. Hurricane Lidia formed in the eastern Pacific Ocean last week and, despite an initially slow development, on Tuesday sustained winds increased by 65 mph in 24 hours. Lidia then ploughed into the west coast of Mexico as a category 4 storm, bringing sustained winds of 140mph, alongside heavy rain that resulted in landslides and some flash flooding.The phenomenon of rapid intensification is caused in part by very warm sea surface temperatures, with those in the western Pacific now trending around 1C-3C above average. As our climate continues to warm, we are likely to see more frequent examples of rapid intensification of tropical storms in future.While Lidia quickly dissipated as it moved inland, Bolaven is slowly weakening as it tracks north-west towards North America, where its remnants are expected to affect the weather next week as it interacts with the jet stream.Meanwhile, September was officially confirmed as the warmest on record by the Copernicus Climate Change Service. The month was 1.8C warmer than pre-industrial levels, smashing the previous record by an astonishing 0.5C. El Ni\u00f1o in the equatorial Pacific is partly responsible for the extreme temperatures, but the UK Met Office said they would be \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d without the influence of human-induced climate change. Now 2023 is on course to be the warmest year in recorded history.Many European countries had their hottest Septembers, including France, Germany and Poland. France experienced an average temperature of 21.5C, making it the hottest September since records began in 1900, while Germany had average temperatures almost 4C higher than the 1961-1990 baseline.

Any practices that fall short of their high standards will not be tolerated.\u201dIn the Netherlands, in which the Guardian uncovered numerous allegations of migrant workers suffering in abusive conditions, the Dutch food retail association Centraal Bureau Levensmiddelenhandel (CBL) said it was important to supermarkets in the country that safe and secure working conditions were present in their supply chains.However, it said it was the government\u2019s responsibility, at national and European level, to police law-breaking.The CBL said in a statement: \u201cThe Dutch supermarkets are continuously working on making their supply chains more sustainable, both in collaboration with supply chain partners, but also with NGOs, trade unions and the government.\u201cAs an example, we have signed the international responsible business conduct agreement for the food products sector. As part of this agreement, we have been working over the last years on implementing due diligence following the UN guiding principles and OECD guidelines to increase transparency within our supply chains and mitigate among other human rights and social risks.\u201cThe use of certification schemes and standards is key in this process of risk mitigation.\u201dAmong individual retailers, there were differences in approaches to monitoring the welfare of workers in meat supply chains.The UK retailers that responded to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment said they followed the BRC\u2019s anti-slavery protocols for supermarkets responding to reported cases of forced labour, human trafficking, debt bondage and other forms of modern slavery in their supply chain.Morrisons and Marks & Spencer both highlighted public commitments to tackle modern slavery, with Marks & Spencer pointing to a review of its working practices carried out earlier this year by Oxfam.Europe mapRevealed: exploitation of meat plant workers rife across UK and EuropeRead moreThe report found some supply chain employees had concerns about speaking out, inadequate sick pay and difficulty in meeting living costs in some instances, which Marks & Spencer said it was taking steps to improve.While many supermarkets in Europe, such as E.Leclerc in France and Rewe in Germany, said they guaranteed the working conditions within the suppliers they owned, they also used additional meat suppliers owned by external companies where they had less control.Among those who responded to the Guardian from the food service sector, KFC said high- or medium-risk suppliers were audited and, \u201cif they don\u2019t pass the audit, we just won\u2019t work with them \u2013 it\u2019s that simple\u201d.JD Wetherspoon said while it had not terminated any contracts because of employment welfare issues, it required all suppliers to agree to its supplier charter, which guarantees fair wages and be a member of the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange, an ethical trade membership organisation.Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

        "text": "Great Britain has one of the most diverse ranges of electricity generation in Europe, with everything from windfarms off the coast of Scotland to a nuclear power station in Suffolk tasked with keeping the lights on. The increasing reliance on renewable energy sources, as part of the country\u2019s green ambitions, also means there can be rapid shifts in the main source of electricity generation. On windy days, most electricity generation comes from onshore and offshore windfarms. When conditions are cold and still, gas-fired power stations known as peaking plants are called into action.The electricity system in Great Britain relies on a combination of \u201cbaseload\u201d power \u2013 from stable generators such as nuclear and biomass plants \u2013 and \u201cintermittent\u201d sources, such as wind and solar farms that need the right weather conditions to feed energy into the grid. National Grid also imports energy from overseas, through subsea cables known as interconnectors that link to France, Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands. They allow companies to trade excess power, such as renewable energy created by the sun, wind and water, between different countries. By 2030 it is hoped that 90% of the energy imported by interconnectors will be from zero carbon energy sources.The technology behind Great Britain\u2019s power generation has evolved significantly over the last century. The first integrated national grid in the world was formed in 1935 linking seven regions of the UK. In the aftermath of industrialisation, coal provided the vast majority of power, before oil began to play an increasingly important part in the 1950s. In 1956, the world\u2019s first commercial nuclear reactor, Calder Hall 1 at Windscale (later Sellafield), was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. Coal use fell significantly in the 1990s while the use of combined cycle gas turbines grew. Now a combination of gas, wind, nuclear and biomass provide the bulk of Great Britain\u2019s energy, with smaller sources such as solar and hydroelectric power also used. From October 2024, coal will no longer be used to generate electricity.MethodologyThe charts visualise Great Britain\u2019s electricity generation data. Northern Ireland has a separate energy market from the rest of the UK and is not included in the figures.Energy generation data is fetched from the Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service public feed, provided by Elexon \u2013 which runs the wholesale energy market \u2013 and is updated every five minutes.Elexon\u2019s data does not include embedded energy, which is unmetered and therefore invisible to Great Britain\u2019s National Grid. Embedded energy comprises all solar energy and wind energy generated from non-metered turbines. To account for these figures we use embedded energy estimates from the National Grid electricity system operator, which are published every 30 minutes.Import figures refer to the net flow of electricity from the interconnectors with Europe and with Northern Ireland. A positive value represents import into the GB transmission system, while a negative value represents an export.Hydro figures combine renewable run-of-the-river hydropower and pumped storage.Biomass figures include Elexon\u2019s \u201cother\u201d category, which comprises coal-to-biomass conversions and biomass combined heat and power plants.The Guardian does not make any attempt to fix potential mistakes in the data feeds; all figures should be taken as indicative.",

This poses a substantial threat to the planet\u2019s biodiversity, a new study warns.Under a high emissions scenario of 4.4C warming, 41% of land vertebrates will experience extreme thermal events by 2099, according to the paper, published in Nature.In worse affected regions, such as the Mojave desert in the US, Gran Chaco in South America, the Sahel and Sahara in Africa and parts of Iran and Afghanistan, 100% of species would be exposed to extreme heat. It is not possible to say if these areas would be uninhabitable, but it is likely that more species would become extinct.A desert tortoise in the Mojave desert in California, US, an area that would be one of the worse hit by extreme heat. Photograph: Scott Trageser/AlamyResearchers mapped the effects of extreme heat on more than 33,000 land vertebrates by looking at maximum temperature data between 1950 and 2099. They considered five predictions of global climatic models based on different levels of greenhouse gas emission, as well as the distribution of terrestrial vertebrates, to work out how exposed animal populations would be.\u201cA couple of studies have shown recent climate warming trends match the 4.4C scenario much better than the other scenarios,\u201d said lead author Gopal Murali, who was at Ben-Gurion University of Negev, Israel when he carried out the research. \u201cWe wanted to highlight the disastrous consequences for wildlife if we end up with a high, unmitigated emission scenario.\u201dAmphibians and reptiles were most affected, with 55% and 51% respectively likely to experience extreme heat events by the end of the century, compared with 26% of birds and 31% of mammals. Amphibians and reptiles are most vulnerable because they generally live within smaller temperature ranges.Under 3.6C of warming, 29% of terrestrial vertebrates will experience extreme heat events, according to the report. This falls to 6% if warming is limited to 1.8C. \u201cDeep greenhouse gas emissions cuts are urgently needed to limit species\u2019 exposure to thermal extremes,\u201d the researchers wrote.Heat stress causes dramatic die-offs and can wipe out entire ecosystems, as happened in the 2021 heatwave along Canada\u2019s Pacific coast, which experts estimate killed more than one billion marine animals. Murali said: \u201cHeatwaves have become frequent. We see them every summer, with new records set all the time, and they have drastic impacts on wildlife.

        "text": "This year marks a decade since the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) gathered in Lyon, France, to unanimously declare that air pollution caused cancer in humans.Air pollution was classified as a type 1 carcinogen, the most certain category possible. This was mainly based on more than 20 years of research in particle pollution and lung cancer.The number of research studies has almost doubled since the IARC meeting in Lyon, with even more evidence on lung cancer in never-smokers, but governmental action to reduce air pollution has not kept up.Globally, outdoor air pollution is second only to tobacco as the greatest cause of lung and respiratory cancers. This holds true in almost all parts of the world, with a notable exception of low-income countries where people (especially women and children) also breathe smoke in their homes from cooking on open fires.In the past 10 years new studies have linked air pollution to other cancers, including breast and bladder cancer. These have also been associated with nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant from diesel traffic that is being targeted by low emissions zones in many cities. There is emerging evidence of links to childhood leukaemia too.For those people with lung cancer, smokers and never-smokers, their prognosis and survival appears to be reduced if they live in a polluted area. Research includes a recent study of more than a quarter of a million people with lung cancer in Pennsylvania. This raises questions about the impact of air pollution on the way that cancer progresses and how it may change the effectiveness of chemotherapy.In 2020, Dr Michelle Turner of ISGlobal, the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, led a review of evidence on cancer and air pollution. She said: \u201cActions to reduce outdoor air pollution will reduce lung cancer in both smokers and in non-smokers. They may also improve survival from lung cancer, especially in those diagnosed in earlier stages of the disease. A study from the UK\u2019s Francis Crick Institute found that living for three years in an area of higher particle pollution might be sufficient to promote growth of EGFR-driven lung cancer, a type of cancer common in never- and light-smokers.\u201dAcross the UK, about 3,500 cancer deaths were attributed to air pollution in 2015. These are not spread evenly. Air pollution affects us all, but some communities are affected more than others. Greatest concentrations are often found in the poorest communities and also in areas with the highest proportion of black, Asian and multiple ethnicities.Turner explained: \u201cRecent studies have shown stronger associations of ambient air pollution and lung cancer risk in lower-socioeconomic neighbourhoods where there are higher air pollution levels. There is an urgent worldwide need for multiple, multi-level public health and policy interventions to improve outdoor air for lung cancer prevention and to reduce disparities in the disease\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This is double the World Health Organization guideline.Prof Sir Stephen Holgate, from the University of Southampton, said: \u201cAir pollution increases the risk of lung and other types of cancer including breast, liver and pancreas. Overall, the American Cancer Association for Cancer Research states that for every 10 micrograms per cubic of increased exposure to PM2.5, the risk of dying from any cancer rises by 22%.\u201d",

The top two-thirds of the giant ash tree we are bringing back to the farm today was blown off by that storm. The recent frozen weather allowed us to get to the remote location without the tractor getting bogged in peaty soil, and now the trunk is to be taken to our local sawmill to be dried, and eventually made into floorboards for our farmhouse renovation.The tree stood in a \u201crelic\u201d or \u201cghost\u201d hedgerow at our abandoned farm, Low Park. These wispy relics of hedgerows with overgrown trees show where field boundaries used to be, before the farm was abandoned 50 years ago when the M6 was built. Now the trunk has been moved, the relic hedgerow can be double fenced and planted up with tree whips this winter. One by one, these tiny whips are reviving the landscape.The hedgerows will provide wildlife habitat, sequester carbon, and enable us to rotationally graze the area more efficiently with our sheep and cows. Regularly moving the animals and allowing the field to rest helps to build soils. Eventually, all our fields at Low Park will be surrounded by thick hedges or strips of woodland. The fields themselves will be like woodland clearings. Already we are seeing more frequent wildlife visitors, including red squirrels, hares and deer.The ash tree that was finally removed after being blown down in Storm Arwen, in Tebay.

        "text": "At this time of the year it is the yellow of the daffodils and primroses and the rich tones of rare red squirrels as they scamper among the oaks and hawthorns, that catch the eye on Brownsea Island.But an ambitious conservation project to turn swathes of this idyllic spot off the coast of Dorset into a summertime riot of purple and violet is under way.The custodians of the island, the National Trust and the Dorset Wildlife Trust, are expanding and linking fragments of heathland, encouraging the return of hectares of heather.They aim to recreate the sort of Dorset heathland that inspired Thomas Hardy, who evoked the power and mystery of wide-open landscapes in novels such as The Return of the Native and The Mayor of Casterbridge.The project is intended to improve the habitat of threatened birds such as the nightjar, a rarely seen nocturnal hunter, and the Dartford warbler, as well as for the 18 species of dragonfly and six species of bat that have been recorded here. It should also improve habitats for lizards, slow worms and the island\u2019s most iconic resident, the red squirrel.As Brownsea Island prepared to greet the first visitors of spring on Saturday, Tim Hartley, lead ranger for the National Trust, explained that over the centuries the heathland on the island had shrunk and become fragmented.\u201cWe want to enlarge those pockets of heathland and knit them back together,\u201d he said. \u201cHeathlands depend on human intervention for their survival and what we\u2019re doing is mimicking the work of our ancestors to make sure that the landscape, and the wildlife that depends on it, is still here in centuries to come.\u201dThe National Trust and Dorset Wildlife Trust plan to restore heathland, with its gorse and heather. Photograph: John Millar/National TrustHeathlands, with their gorse and heather, were widespread in England for centuries, formed by farmers to graze their animals and kept alive by the sort of rural people immortalised in Hardy\u2019s work.A drive for productivity in the 20th century saw much of this wild landscape lost in favour of wooded areas and more intensively cultivated farmland. It is believed that only a sixth of the UK\u2019s lowland heath remains, mainly in isolated pockets surrounded by towns and cities.Over the decades, Brownsea changed from a heather-rich island to one dominated by trees and gardens. In the 18th-century, landowners planted pines and created orchards and walled gardens, with little thriving in the shadow of the pines. In the early 20th century, the reclusive Mary Bonham-Christie, nicknamed the Demon of Brownsea, allowed nature to run riot, causing the island to become choked with invasive rhododendron, which loves the acidic soil. The National Trust took over exactly 60 years ago.During the winter, while Brownsea Island has been shut to visitors, clumps of Scots pine have been thinned to let in more light. Workers are also in the process of removing 12.5 hectares (30 acres) of rhododendron.Heather cuttings will be taken from existing patches and scattered across bare soil, allowing new clumps to grow. Seed is being collected from the Purbeck heaths national nature reserve on the mainland and ferried to Brownsea. Twenty five hectares of heathland is to be restored during the five-year project.Renewing gorse will improve the habitat for threatened birds such as the Dartford warbler, pictured with a heath moth in its beak. Photograph: Martin Bennett/National TrustNaturally, great care has been taken to ensure the red squirrels, for whom Brownsea is one of only two stable enclaves in the south of England, will benefit.Hartley said: \u201cBy opening up these woodlands, we\u2019re making space for trees to regenerate and encouraging them to form lower branches and bigger canopies, which means more food and better homes for red squirrels.\u201d He said the idea was not to clear all trees but to create a diverse wooded heath habitat.Luke Johns, Poole harbour reserves officer at Dorset Wildlife Trust, said the project would make a huge difference to wildlife habitats on the island.He said: \u201cOur nature reserve in the northern part of the island provides sanctuary for rare and threatened species, from tiny insects and ground-nesting birds to the rare red squirrel and the water vole in its woods, reed beds and lagoon. These heathland and woodland restoration works are going to improve, expand and link up habitats across the island.\u201d",

But under the draft legislation, subsidence, one of the most contentious impacts of CSG extraction, will be removed from that assessment process and instead assessed under the MERCP Act.\u201cThey\u2019re stripping the ability for farmers to protect their land,\u201d Pointon said.In its own submission to the state government, the peak farming body Agforce Queensland said it was supportive of the proposed introduction of a new subsidence impact framework but \u201cstrongly disagrees\u201d with the removal of CSG-induced subsidence impacts from the RPI Act.Liza Balmain runs a cotton and mixed grain farm 200km west of Brisbane and has been a staunch opponent to CSG expansion in the area for almost a decade, hosting the independent senator David Pocock, environmental and legal experts, and farmers at a meeting in opposition to Arrow Energy\u2019s Surat gas project this year. She also made a submission on the proposed amendments.Broken Warwick clock tower leaves Australian town stuck in time warpRead more\u201cTo remove the assessment of subsidence from the RPI Act is removing that barrier to Arrow Energy\u2019s advancements on the Darling Downs,\u201d Balmain said.Some farmers who have allowed gas wells on their properties say they have experienced subsidence but it has not affected their operations. Gas wells from Arrow Energy are scattered throughout Ian Hayllor\u2019s cotton and grain fields. He allowed them in exchange for compensation.Hayllor says decade-old gas wells on neighbouring properties have caused his fields to subside.\u201cThe surface has stayed exactly the same the whole place has just dropped 50mm,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even know it happened without looking at the data.\u201dA spokesperson from the Queensland department of infrastructure, local government and planning said the department was reviewing more than 370 submissions.\u201cThe proposed amendments aim to promote a more consistent and transparent assessment framework,\u201d the spokesperson said.\u201cIn line with recommendations from the GasFields Commission Queensland, the proposed subsidence management framework identifies a pathway to assess potential subsidence impacts using a science-based risk assessment process.\u201dDr Madeline Taylor from Macquarie University said the Queensland government had a long history of \u201cpiecemeal\u201d and \u201creactive\u201d regulation of the gas industry.\u201cWe\u2019ve come up with a co-existence regulatory approach of let\u2019s regulate now and think about how we manage the impacts later,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s a learning by doing approach.\u201cWhat\u2019s fundamentally missing in Queensland is an authority made up of agricultural experts and landowners themselves.\u201dA spokesperson from Arrow Energy said the company was \u201ccommitted to genuine coexistence with landholders\u201d and \u201cwelcomed the opportunity to participate in the government\u2019s consultation process\u201d.\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community\n",

Urban water demand is predicted to increase by 80% by 2050.Water shortages are also becoming a more frequent occurrence in rural areas, the report found. Currently, between 2 billion and 3 billion people experience water shortages for at least a month a year.Audrey Azoulay, director general of Unesco, the UN agency that produced the report, said governments must cooperate over water. \u201cThere is an urgent need to establish strong international mechanisms to prevent the global water crisis from spiralling out of control. Water is our common future, and it is essential to act together to share it equitably and manage it sustainably,\u201d she said.The UN is holding its first water conference since 1977 in New York this week, co-hosted by the governments of the Netherlands and Tajikistan, at which global water issues will be discussed by ministers and a small number of heads of state from around the world. They will hear warnings of a looming water crisis, which has been largely neglected by governments.About 2 billion people globally do not have safe drinking water, while 3.6 billion lack access to safely managed sanitation, according to the report.Water use has been growing globally by about 1% a year for the last 40 years and this will continue, driven by population growth and development. About a 10th of the global population live in countries with high water stress.But experts told the Guardian that governments were failing to take the water crisis seriously. Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and co-chair of the Global Commission on the Economics of Water, said: \u201cThe scientific evidence is that we have a water crisis. We are misusing water, polluting water and changing the whole global hydrological cycle through what we are doing to the climate. It\u2019s a triple crisis.\u201dA landmark report published last week by the Global Commission on the Economics of Water found that demand for fresh water would outstrip supply by 40% by 2030. This would have huge implications for the global economy, for nature, for urban living and for the climate, but few governments were taking action to preserve water supplies and cut pollution, the report found.Rockstr\u00f6m said addressing the problems with water was essential to tackling other global crises, including food and the climate. \u201cThere will be no agricultural revolution unless we fix water,\u201d he said. \u201cBehind all these challenges we are facing, there\u2019s always water and we never talk about water.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Funding for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa), which investigates pollution and protects water quality, had fallen by 26%.The cuts raise profound questions for the Scottish government about its ability to meet increasingly urgent nature and climate targets, which are likely to cost billions of pounds to achieve, the charities say.The group, which includes the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the John Muir Trust, Trees for Life, the Scottish Wildlife Trust, Buglife and Plantlife, have urged the Scottish government to increase environment spending at its next budget, later in December.The programmes affected, they say, include a pledge made by Scottish ministers after an international biodiversity summit to protect 30% of nature by 2030, a target underpinned by the convention on biological diversity agreed in Montreal last December.In a joint letter coordinated by Scottish Environment Link, an umbrella group of nature and conservation groups, the signatories said: \u201cThe Scottish government is rightly committed to setting ambitious targets for environmental action.\u201cBut as the impacts of climate change and nature loss become more strongly felt, simply maintaining current environmental standards will become harder. The longer we do not act, the more expensive and less palatable it will become.\u201dThe signatories said the cuts have meant:\nNearly 60% of Scotland\u2019s legally protected sites of special scientific interest \u2013 the most precious in the country \u2013 have not been assessed in more than a decade, with only 65% in favourable condition.\n\nOnly half of the sites which make up Scotland\u2019s \u201cAtlantic rainforest\u201d are in favourable condition.\n\nScottish government funding for nature fell from 0.55% of its total budget to 0.25% between 2010/11 and 2022/23.\n\nSepa\u2019s budget cuts have made it heavily reliant on so-called \u201ccost recovery\u201d fees it charges to inspect private companies but those fees have not kept pace with inflation, falling by 14% in real terms.\nskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

He played rugby, with more enthusiasm than talent; and, in spite of being Jewish, took pride in reading the lesson in chapel: this gave him an inkling that there might be something true in religion. This conviction developed into an active involvement in the Reform Synagogues of Great Britain, now known as the Movement for Reform Judaism, first in the 1960s as a member of the newly formed Finchley Reform Synagogue in London, and later as chair (1996-99) of the national movement.Born in Cricklewood, north-west London, Neville was brought up by relatives following the hospitalisation of his mother, Rachel (nee Proops), who died when he was five. He remained close to his father, Sam, an accountant, who sent his son, after the disruption of the second world war years, to Haileybury, where he became head boy.He entered the same accountancy firm as his father, who died suddenly when Neville was 22, and remained at Barnes Roffe for the whole of his career, eventually becoming an innovative senior partner. Marriage to Margaret Cohen in 1958, and their devoted raising of three daughters, was combined with his professional life.Meanwhile, his interest in personal development led him to become involved in neurolinguistic programming and the Landmark Forum, an organisation offering training in personal and professional growth. But it was his encounter in 1974 with the spiritual exercises of Subud, an international spiritual community inspired by Islamic mysticism, that became pivotal to his growing awareness that personal spirituality and collective social and environmental transformation went hand in hand.A conversation with Rabbi Lionel Blue, and a close working relationship with his synagogue\u2019s rabbi, Jeffrey Newman, supported his conviction that a divine energy (what people call God) was available for individuals and groups and that contact with this force could lead to remarkable changes.He was insistent, when talking to me, a friend and rabbi, that liturgical creativity was vital in helping Jews develop their own relationship with God and that spiritual work and political activism were indivisible.Active in the Jewish Board of Deputies, he fought an often lonely battle to raise awareness in the Jewish community of the moral imperative to take the environmental crisis seriously. It was only when he was able to involve David Miliband (then secretary of state for the environment) in the launch in 2007 of the Big Green Jewish Website, that change in the community\u2019s awareness began to gather pace.Neville is survived by Margaret, and their daughters, Jo, Jane and Gill, and grandchildren, Ellie and Jess.",

        "text": "For traditionalists, the unveiling of the first of 438 solar panels on the roof of King\u2019s College chapel in Cambridge may have been a dark day.Historic England objected strongly to the planning application for the panels on the lead roof of the English gothic masterpiece, warning of irreparable damage to an \u201cexceptionally significant building\u201d. Cambridge city council\u2019s planning officer argued that the PV panels \u2013 with the potential to generate 123,000kWh of electricity a year \u2013 would erode the \u201cauthenticity and integrity\u201d of this \u201chistorically iconic medieval building\u201d.And King\u2019s, nearly 600 years old but usually regarded as the radical provocateur among Cambridge colleges, was criticised in the Spectator for \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d over the panels, which will meet all the chapel\u2019s power needs but provide just 5.5% of the college\u2019s overall electricity requirements.However, the college provost and dean were beaming on a rooftop tour of the ongoing installation on Tuesday.\u201cIt\u2019s not so much signalling virtue as signalling a clarion call for change,\u201d said Gillian Tett, a Financial Times columnist and the new provost of King\u2019s. \u201cWe face a climate emergency. We have to be imaginative about how we respond to it. Yes, it\u2019s a symbol but symbols reinforce what\u2019s normal and we\u2019re trying to change what\u2019s thought of as normal.\u201dGillian Tett said: \u2018People don\u2019t come to King\u2019s College chapel to see the roof.\u2019 Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianThe Rev Dr Stephen Cherry, dean of the college, said he thought the solar panels humanised the building. \u201cIt\u2019s our own local powerhouse,\u201d he said.Cherry admitted he was surprised when the college was permitted to fit the solar array. Councillors sitting on the city\u2019s planning committee only voted unanimously in favour of the panels \u2013 against their planning officer\u2019s advice \u2013 after a barnstorming appeal by former provost and astrophysicist Michael Proctor.Striding the scaffold boards across the apex of the roof, Cherry said: \u201cIt was a surprise really because it\u2019s so difficult to know how people are going to balance the aesthetic against the practical. Different people will make that judgment differently at different times. What\u2019s significant is that the application caught the public mood. My guess is that it would have been different five or 10 years ago.\u201dThe south-facing lead roof was only fitted in the 1950s but both sides required new lead, which is recycled: partly made from melting down the old one. The panels are being placed on both the north- and south-facing sides, with the former forecast to provide 40% of electricity generated.With 28 panels installed, the PV engineer Adam Hyland was enjoying the vista across Cambridge to the Isle of Ely in the north and the Gog Magog hills to the south. \u201cHow often do you get a chance to have a view like this, standing on a building of this calibre?\u201d he said.Down below, the panels \u2013 which, combined with heat pumps, retrofitting insulation and passive-standard new buildings, will help the college become net zero by 2038 \u2013 were invisible from the classic view of the Backs, and difficult to spot from streets and courts behind the chapel\u2019s ornate pinnacles.Tett is convinced they will not spoil visitors\u2019 enjoyment of a building which is the quintessential, global image of Oxbridge \u2013 although filmmakers of period drama might be forced to get out the CGI.\u201cPeople don\u2019t come to King\u2019s College chapel to see the roof, they come to see the gothic ceiling and the stained-glass windows and the King Henry VIII wooden arch,\u201d said Tett. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to pretend that the solar panels are invisible because they\u2019re not.\u201cKing\u2019s College is proud to be progressive. We know that we have this extraordinary building which for many people is the face of Cambridge. We\u2019re constantly featured in Hollywood films and on Instagram. We have this incredible historic legacy. We can either be trapped by our historic past, or we try and use that as a springboard to look forward.\u201dKing\u2019s is not the first ecclesiastical building or Grade I-listed attraction to have solar panels fitted: Gloucester, Salisbury and Bradford cathedrals all have solar panels. Tett said she hoped King\u2019s would inspire more of England\u2019s 16,000 churches to follow, particularly as churches have historically been built facing east and so usually have a large expanse of south-facing roof.\u201cThe UK is stuffed full of churches which are often not being used very much. We\u2019ve got all those big south-facing roofs,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is giving a real strong symbol to everyone to imagine things that were once unimaginable.\u201d\nThis article was amended on 29 November 2023. The King\u2019s College chapel solar panels have the potential to generate 123,000kWh of electricity, not 106,000kWh. Also, an earlier version gave the number of panels as \u201cmore than 400\u201d; to be more precise, there are 438.\n",

After fossil fuels, it is the country\u2019s largest source of national income, and a hugely lucrative one: in 2022, operating profit margins for Norway\u2019s salmon farmers were estimated at 45%.Last September, the Norwegian government set out a proposal to raise taxes on the industry. Aimed at sharing the profits of one the country\u2019s key resources, the idea was widely described as a \u201csalmon tax\u201d, and set at 40% (on top of 22% corporation tax).Within hours, share prices for salmon firms plummeted, with the seafood index on the Oslo Stock Exchange dropping by 25%. Last week, however, the government proposed to press forward regardless, albeit lowering the provisional tax to 35%.The finance ministry has insisted that the controversial levy is designed to ensure that coastal communities receive more of the \u201cvalue created by fish farming\u201d. Host municipalities will receive more for \u201cschools, elderly care and other welfare services\u201d, it said.The tax extends the principle behind Norway\u2019s pension fund. This type of policy is exactly what\u2019s needed for the 21st centuryProf Guy StandingDefenders of the tax also see it as a way to reduce state reliance on the country\u2019s oil and pension funds, and to offset the government\u2019s increased spending on electricity subsidies amid Europe\u2019s energy crisis.Industry representatives, on the other hand, argue that the new levy will undermine price competitiveness and economic growth.\u201cA 35% ground rent will represent a tripling of the tax level for salmon companies,\u201d Kristin Langeland, of the Norwegian Seafood Federation, said of the proposal.\u201cThere have already been layoffs \u2026 and there will be less money for investment. The tax will damage Norway\u2019s economy.\u201dLangeland claimed 40bn kroner (\u00a33.1bn) of salmon-linked investments have been postponed or cancelled since last autumn after the government first proposed the tax.While share prices for Norway\u2019s major salmon companies, including Mowi, SalMar and Grieg Seafood, took a hit, observers said smaller producers could stand to benefit.View image in fullscreenA salmon farm in Grovfjord, Norway. The industry says the tax will spark layoffs but a leading academic argues that it would spread the profits from use of the \u2018natural commons\u2019 beyond a few private firms. Photograph: Elisabeth Balteskard/AFP/GettyFirms generating less than NOK 70m in annual profits \u2013 nearly two-thirds of Norway\u2019s salmon farmers \u2013 look likely to be exempt from the tax, incentivising smaller producers to buy up sizeable state licences that until now only major players could afford.The bill could bring other benefits, too. Guy Standing, a professor at Soas University of London and author of The Blue Commons: Rescuing the Economy of the Sea, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t just designed to be anti-oligopolistic. It also offers an alternative to the prevailing model for managing seascapes.\u201dStanding pointed out that since 1982, when the UN convention on the law of the seas enshrined the principle of sovereign jurisdiction over territorial waters, governments around the world have sold off vast tracts of ocean territory through state licences.The supervision of marine ecosystems was largely entrusted to private companies, and the rapid growth of commercial maritime activity, including shipping, drilling, deep-sea mining, aquaculture and bioprospecting, followed in tow.\u201cThe natural commons belong to everybody. It\u2019s not fair that the spoils flow disproportionately to a handful of private firms,\u201d Standing said.Offshore fish farms: a new wave of food production \u2026 or the \u2018wild west\u2019 of  ocean pollution?Read more\u201cThe new salmon tax extends the principle behind Norway\u2019s pension fund,\u201d he added. \u201cThis type of policy is exactly what\u2019s needed for the 21st century.\u201dNorway is not alone in expanding taxes on producers. In August, the Faroe Islands will introduce a new set of levies on salmon farms, again with the aim of sharing out the benefits from high consumer prices. The tax will be based on earnings and will be vary from 0.5% to 20%.Experts say such taxes on ocean resources, as well as supporting local communities, have the potential to limit destruction of the marine environment by making ocean-based activities that damage it \u2013 such as offshore drilling, freight shipping and deep-sea mining \u2013 more expensive. They could also help developing countries, in particular, to raise badly needed public funds.Although Oslo\u2019s new fish tax will not guarantee improved environmental regulations, Standing argues that it will lead to an improved income distribution from the exploitation of common resources. \u201cNorway\u2019s salmon tax puts people ahead of profits,\u201d he said.",

There are physical assets, like substations, which transmission companies will need to build or upgrade.\u201dThe government is belatedly attempting to tackle a logjam that has resulted in some developments facing a 10- to 15-year wait for a connection to the grid. Ofgem announced on Monday plans to remove \u201czombie\u201d projects from the queue to connect up to speed up those ready to produce renewable power for the grid.Although no equivalent queue exists for those looking to take power from the grid, ministers and officials are concerned that large projects could struggle to secure final investment and proceed without guarantees over their connection to the electricity supply.Sources said changes to the rules had been proposed with several big projects in mind: Tata\u2019s new \u00a34bn electric battery factory, expected to be built in Somerset; and the switch to electric arc furnaces at Britain\u2019s biggest steelworks at Port Talbot in south Wales, also owned by the Indian group.The \u00a31.25bn plan from British Steel, which is owned by China\u2019s Jingye, to replace two blast furnaces at Scunthorpe steelworks, with an electric arc furnace at the north Lincolnshire plant and another at a site in Teesside, North Yorkshire, has also formed part of the proposals. Negotiations over the closure of blast furnaces at Port Talbot and Scunthorpe are expected to lead to thousands of job losses.All three projects are likely to involve significant investment from the UK government, alongside the companies\u2019 overseas owners.Britain has 10 distribution network operators, including National Grid and Northern Powergrid, which operate monopolies in their regions and handle transmission of power from the grid to end users.Sources said the move could be announced as soon as this month, and may be included within the \u201cconnections action plan\u201d, a broader overhaul of Britain\u2019s network connections.The plan, which is expected to be announced alongside the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement next week, will rebalance the planning system to help speed up the connection of new solar and windfarms to the grid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "From luxury yachts to private jets and supercars, the enormously destructive travel and leisure habits of the super-rich are to the fore in the latest research on the carbon gap that divides the world\u2019s wealthiest people from everyone else. Calculations by Oxfam, the\u00a0Stockholm Environment Institute and others reveal\u00a0that the richest 1% produced as much carbon pollution in one year as the 5 billion people who make\u00a0up the poorest two-thirds of humanity. Though\u00a0they number just 2,600, the combined wealth\u00a0of the world\u2019s billionaires is greater than the GDP of all but two countries \u2013 the US and China. The\u00a0impact on the environment of their carbon\u2011intensive behaviour is colossal.But as this week\u2019s Guardian series, the great carbon divide, has shown, outsized emissions are not only the work of this minority of the ultra-wealthy. Nor are they confined to the far larger number of individuals with a net worth of at least $1m, combined with energy\u2011intensive lifestyles, who social scientist Dario\u00a0Kenner calls the \u201cpolluter elite\u201d. In\u00a0fact, half of all emissions are produced by the top 10% \u2013 that is, the much bigger group of about 800 million people who earn at least $40,000. While in their own countries these people are regarded as middle income or middle class, their consumption and emissions far outstrip those of 90% of the world\u2019s inhabitants.The environment movement has largely sought to avoid personalising the world\u2019s carbon problem for the good reason that this plays into the hands of oil and gas producers (whether businesses or governments). The framing of global heating as primarily an issue for consumers, rather than politicians, was what lay behind BP\u2019s creation of the carbon footprint calculator. But while lifestyle changes must not be allowed to distract from the role of governments in moving away from fossil fuels, they are too important to be ignored. Instead, policymakers of all kinds should acknowledge their role in guiding and enforcing greener choices.To give an example: two-thirds of Norwegian households have heat pumps due to taxes on carbon heating and their government\u2019s decision to train a workforce to install them. Norway, of course, is a small and wealthy country. But if we are serious about ending our reliance on fossil fuels, then more carbon taxes and emissions-limiting regulations are necessary \u2013 even if free-market ideologues deny this and ignore the role of subsidies and investment decisions in upholding the status quo.The UN climate process has highlighted the already terrible impacts on the world\u2019s poorest countries of a crisis caused primarily by developed nations. Last year a \u201closs and damage\u201d fund was created to address these (though so far contributions by rich countries have fallen far short). But vital as this dimension of the climate crisis is, it is not the only one. Massive carbon inequalities exist within countries as well as between them. And these too must be reduced, by policies including progressive carbon taxes that protect the living standards of poorer people. If governments do not do this, and instead place themselves in the service of elites, there is a growing risk of a backlash derailing climate action\u00a0\u2013 what Thomas Piketty, a French economist, warns\u00a0could become \u201ca gigantic yellow vest movement\u201d. The case for climate justice, in other words, must be made at a national level as well as an\u00a0international one.",

Officials hoped the woodland would improve the environment, provide green space and encourage wildlife habitats.However, Stockport councillors have learned the land is unsuitable for tree planting because of sewage discharges leaching into the ground. They were told the resulting soil contamination would make it hard to plant the trees, so they had decided to cancel the woodland.Assessments are being done by United Utilities and council officials to find out the scale of the problem, but the council said it had decided there were too many risks to human health, including workers having to dig into raw sewage to plant trees, and there were worries the contaminants would prevent the trees growing.The council-owned land by Otterspool Road in Romiley.This is a fresh blow to attempts by local councils to create green spaces to improve local areas in the face of funding cuts and battles to keep existing spaces open.Raw sewage contains many problematic elements, including heavy metals that can be toxic to plants, and nutrients that can disturb ecosystems.According to Environment Agency data, United Utilities discharged sewage at Otterspool Road 135 times last year, which amounted to 40 days of sewage flowing.The water company was found to be the most polluting in the country last year. One of United Utilities\u2019 pipes spilled sewage into the River Ellen, near the Lake District, for nearly 7,000 hours in 2022. Environment Agency data also showed that 10 of the country\u2019s 20 pipes that spilled the most sewage in 2022 were owned by United Utilities, which provides water to the north-west and the Lake District.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Seeing and hearing people from every corner of the planet is always one of the highlights of Cop. NLDelegates from Brazil, Samela Satere Mawe and Tukuma Pataxo, at Cop28. Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/ReutersWelcome to the petrostateMost delegates arriving at Cop28 will have entered the desert city of Dubai along a 12-lane highway, reeking of petrol fumes: welcome to the petrostate of the United Arab Emirates. It\u2019s not the first time the fossil-fuelled nature of the host nation\u2019s economy has been an olfactory leitmotif for the climate conference. In the Polish coal town of Katowice in 2018, Cop attenders were marinated in smoky aromas for the entire two weeks.There are visual signs too. One delegate opened her hotel room curtains on her first morning to be greeted by the largest gas power generation facility in the world: \u201cFitting. I am going to stare at this through the haze of pollution for two weeks.\u201d And on heading into the conference centre on the metro, at least 50 tall industrial smokestacks mark the way. DCUnsettling atmosphereThe Cop28 venue itself is, as is usually the case for these gatherings, sprawling, bland and plastered with the sort of clunky slogans \u2013 \u201cAction builds trust\u201d; \u201cHope inspires action\u201d \u2013 that could distract you from the fact this whole thing is being run by an oil executive if they didn\u2019t read like motivational aphorisms conjured up by ChatGPT.But some delegates arriving in Dubai were more concerned about what\u2019s outside the cavernous Expo City, namely the air quality. A haze settled over Dubai on Tuesday and Wednesday, shrouding its vertiginous buildings and bringing air pollution unhealthy to sensitive groups, according to IQAir, an air monitoring service. The air quality improved a little on Thursday, the opening day of Cop28, but was still four times worse than guideline levels set by the World Health Organization.Sandstorms can cause hazy days here but much of the pollution stems from the UAE\u2019s network of oil and gas fields near Dubai. Gas is flared almost on a daily basis, worsening air pollution, despite a commitment by the UAE to stop the practice, the Guardian revealed last month.

Then it wraps silk around its body and \u201cgoes through this extraordinary metamorphosis where it changes into a butterfly\u201d.Female adults then \u201csearch for somewhere to lay their eggs,\u201d which tend to be the underside of leaves.Elgar said the cabbage butterfly influx was occurring in Melbourne and Sydney but \u201cprobably hidden in places in-between as well\u201d.\u201cI am sure it is not just an urban city thing.\u201dGardeners across several states have been taking to social media with images and anecdotes of a \u201cplague\u201d of larvae \u201cdecimating\u201d brassica plants and adult butterflies hovering around their gardens.\u201cThe reason for that would be the climate,\u201d said Dr Thomas White, an ecologist from the University of Sydney.A mild winter meant more pupate survived than usual.

Installing nets over plant bushes will prevent adults laying more eggs. The headline, text and picture caption of this article were amended on 16 November 2023.

But according to research published on Wednesday, only Scotland, Wales, and the south-east and east of England met it.Yet none of these regions were in the top five for accessibility of green space. Overall, 2,779,065 people in Britain, about one in 24 people, lived more than 10 minutes from the nearest park. The worst region for accessibility to green space was Wales, where one in 13 people lived more than 10 minutes from a park or public garden.The findings come from Fields in Trust\u2019s green spaces index, published every year since 2019. The charity\u2019s guidance for outdoor sport and play, first published in the 1930s, recommends a minimum of 6 acres (2.4 hectares) of accessible green space \u2013 such as parks, public gardens, nature reserves and playing fields \u2013 per 1,000 people.Top 10 green spaces in England and Wales for \u2018welfare value\u2019 named in studyRead moreA spokesperson for the charity said it only published data for broad regions to avoid setting up a \u201cleague table\u201d that would unfairly single out certain areas. But cross-referencing findings with those areas prioritised for the government\u2019s levelling up agenda showed they had on average 10% less green space than the standard, the charity said.The index exposed large disparities between regions. People in Scotland, the best-served part of Britain, had 41 sq metres of public green space per person, more than double the 19 sq metres available to Londoners.However, even those living in regions with more green space could find those areas comparatively more inaccessible. The figures showed about one in 17 people in Scotland lived more than 10 minutes walk from their nearest green space, compared to almost as few as one in 1,000 in London.There were no publicly available maps or datasets of green space in Northern Ireland.The Labour MP Clive Betts, the chair of the levelling up, housing and communities scrutiny committee, described the findings as timely. \u201cI think, particularly during the lockdown, the importance of green space and accessible green space near to people\u2019s homes was highlighted as never before,\u201d Betts said.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am BSTThe government ought to encourage local authorities to engage with Fields in Trust, which buys up green spaces to hold them in trust for the people in perpetuity, Betts said.\u201cAnd the government probably ought to think about the issue of funding for open space in general,\u201d he added. \u201cWe did a report as a select committee on parks and open spaces about five years ago now.

Germany spent $9bn on hydrogen alone.The work draws on evidence collected up to February 2021 by Oxford University\u2019s Economic Recovery Project. The initiative is supported by the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund.Brian O\u2019Callaghan, an Australian economist and engineer who leads Oxford\u2019s Economic Recovery Project, told Guardian Australia the research indicates that governments are falling short on green recovery spending in global terms.00:03:39The Green Recovery: how to fix Australia's energy-inefficient homes \u2013 videoUK foreign secretary pushes Australia to 'stretch' climate commitments before global summitRead moreAustralia got the wooden spoon \u2013 coming in at the bottom of the list.The UN-backed research differentiates between rescue and recovery spending during the crisis. Rescue spending encompasses management of the public health crisis and fiscal support to insulate against the economic shock, whereas recovery spending focuses on rebuilding and retooling economies post-Covid.\u201cWhat we found is Australia has spent considerably more on recovery initiatives than most other countries, I think only the United Kingdom has done more,\u201d O\u2019Callaghan said.\u201cThat\u2019s understandable because Australia is at the tail end of the virus and we are trying to get the economy going again, while other countries are still in it. Interestingly, Australia has also been a standout on green spending, but unfortunately, on the negative side.\u201cOverall we find that 18% of total recovery spending around the world has gone towards green initiatives, but in Australia, the figure is 2%. Of the major economies, Australia was the worst.\u201dO\u2019Callaghan said this was \u201ca missed opportunity\u201d for the Morrison government and a bad outcome for the country.\u201cThe consequences for Australia of low green investment are mammoth on both economic and climate grounds,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is the time for us to be reorienting our economy to industries that will drive future growth. The notion of a gas-fired recovery is ridiculous and the world sees that. Recession enables rebirth \u2013 now is not the time for dirty initiatives.\u201dLast year, the International Monetary Fund urged both major and developing economies to pursue a green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.The IMF said if nations applied a combination of carbon pricing and green stimulus, coupled with compensation for lower-income households to make the transition fair, the world would plot a sustainable path out of deep recession and combat the growing climate crisis.Doubling uptake of wind and solar power could set up Australia for net zero emissions by 2040Read moreSome Australian business groups have also urged the government to pursue a green recovery.Australia also remains under pressure from key allies to lift the level of climate policy ambition. The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Thursday the UK expected Australia to \u201cstretch\u201d climate commitments and set out a plan to meet them before a major summit later this year.This week, Morrison reiterated his intention to reach net zero emissions \u201cas soon as possible and preferably by 2050\u201d and transition Australia to a \u201cnew energy economy\u201d. he made the comments in a conversation with Joe Biden\u2019s special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry.The US and the UK last week issued a joint statement urging all countries \u201cto take the steps needed to keep a 1.5C temperature limit within reach, including through ambitious nationally determined contributions and long-term strategies to cut emissions and reach net zero\u201d.Official projections released in December suggested the Morrison government was not yet on track to meet its 2030 emissions target of a 26% to 28% cut compared with 2005 levels. Scientists say that target is roughly half of what Australia should be doing over that timeframe.The Australian ambassador to the US, Arthur Sinodinos, this week implied the Morrison government was considering updating its targets before the Glasgow conference, known as Cop26.Sinodinos told the US Studies Centre event in Canberra it was \u201cbetter to underpromise and overdeliver\u201d when setting emission reduction targets, and Australia wanted to work with the US on technologies that would \u201creally move the dial\u201d.\u201cOur view is targets are something which are important in their own regard, and Australia is doing further work on what that means in the future as we go to Cop26,\u201d he said.00:03:42The Green Recovery: how Australia can clean up its act on energy \u2013 video",

It states: \u201cAllowing our town and village centres within protected landscapes (such as national parks) to benefit from the right could help ensure the longer-term viability and vitality of these community hubs, supporting the residents and businesses that rely on them.\u201dIt specifically cites the aim to give farmers the ability to change their agricultural buildings into houses: \u201cWe want to give farmers greater freedom to change the use of their existing buildings to residential use and support the delivery of new homes in rural communities.\u201dHowever, national park chiefs have said the proposals are \u201cbonkers\u201d and could cause thousands of new developments to mar the views in some of England\u2019s most beautiful areas.David Butterworth, the CEO of the Yorkshire Dales national park, told the Guardian: \u201cIf I was trying to devise a policy that would essentially lead to the destruction of Yorkshire Dales national park, this would be the policy. These are permitted development rights to convert a property without any planning restriction. This means the 6,500 field barns in the Yorkshire Dales could be converted into homes. The idea they could be homes with no restrictions would decimate the landscapes.\u201cIt is one of the most bonkers examples of environmental destruction I could think of. I am extremely concerned that this has been introduced now with an eight-week consultation. It is just crackers.\u201dKevin Bishop, the CEO of Dartmoor national park authority, added: \u201cNational parks were designated for their outstanding natural beauty. The proposed extension of permitted developments could destroy these landscapes and cause untold harm to the local economy and local communities. The ability to convert any equestrian field shelter or agricultural barn to an open market house would cause untold damage to our landscapes and yet do nothing to support the provision of affordable housing.\u201dPoliticians have also vowed to oppose the proposed legislation. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, said: \u201cThe government needs to stop this now. Our national parks cannot become a developer free-for-all.

They will be monitoring the behaviour and interactions of meerkats with zookeepers, whom they see regularly, and with zoo visitors, with whom they are unfamiliar.The study will investigate how the animals react to different people and whether they demonstrate empathy by mirroring their emotions.The case against pets: is it time to give up our cats and dogs?Read moreDr Samantha Ward, a zoo animal welfare researcher at Nottingham Trent University\u2019s school of animal, rural and environmental sciences, said: \u201cWild animals housed in zoos undergo daily interactions with familiar and unfamiliar people and this presents an ideal opportunity to see if they recognise human emotions and in a sense \u2018catch\u2019 them.\u201cWe\u2019re keen to know whether these abilities might be influenced by the frequency of human-animal interactions, as might be the case with strangers, or familiarity with known people such as zookeepers. For example, if zookeepers influence the behaviour of meerkats but the visitors do not, then this could impact the management of the animals.\u201cIf it\u2019s the people rather than the zookeepers, then that could be considered when undertaking measures such as enclosure design.\u201dExperts already believe that domesticated animals such as cats, dogs and horses are able to understand how people feel, but less is known about wild animals housed in zoos.Meerkats are highly attentive to their surroundings, including to zoo visitors, and commonly interact with both familiar and unfamiliar people as part of animal-visitor experiences. For these reasons, they are considered the perfect species on which to focus.Dr Annika Paukner, associate professor in comparative psychology at Nottingham Trent University\u2019s school of social sciences, said: \u201cOur study combines expertise in zoo biology and human-animal interactions with psychology and comparative cognition. The recognition of others\u2019 emotions is vital for effective interactions across social animals, including humans.\u201cPeople are so sensitive to others\u2019 emotions, for instance that interacting with an anxious person may increase one\u2019s own anxiety.

The Committee to Protect Journalists counted 67 victims, including Phillips. Fifteen of these were in Ukraine; almost half were in Latin America and the Caribbean. This year there have so far been 12 deaths.It is too soon to assert with confidence that President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has succeeded in ending what he called the \u201cnightmare\u201d of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s era of devastation, including deforestation and human rights abuses. What is certain is that people around the world, as well as in Brazil, need accurate information about the complex situation in the world\u2019s largest rainforest, which plays a vital part in the climate system and is among the most biodiverse places on the planet.Organised crime is one threat, with one former police chief warning that illegal miners and drug traffickers could form armies, and take over the region, as happened in Colombia. But multinational mining and agricultural businesses also cause huge damage while making vast profits legally. Deforestation linked to cattle ranching and logging accelerated dramatically under Bolsonaro. But Lula\u2019s attempts to reverse it face powerful opposition. The World Bank, which previously financed forest-clearing industries, has belatedly recognised the destruction of the Amazon as a market failure on a massive scale. It, along with other global institutions, must now be proactive in financing this giant carbon sink. Justice as well as self-interest demands that global north countries contribute to this effort, and do not leave it to Brazil.Work to conserve what is left of the Amazon, in concert with its Indigenous residents, must be international but also local. Without eyes on the ground, deep in the jungle as well as in the world\u2019s boardrooms and parliaments, no one knows what is actually happening there. Pereira and Phillips lost their lives trying to understand, and to tell the world, about efforts to develop the Amazon \u2013 and about efforts to resist such development in favour of less destructive alternatives. It\u2019s in all our interests to carry on what they began.\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "text": "The problem with modern Britain, said Liz Truss in a recent interview, is that it remains in thrall to social democratic ideas ushered in by New Labour in 1997 and which the Conservatives have not been bold enough in combatting or reversing. This will have been news to much of the public, particularly those who remember the long years of Conservative austerity after 2010 and the Tory party\u2019s self\u2011expulsion of Britain from the European Union after 2016. Neither of these dominant events of the last 13 years was a flagship social democratic policy last time we looked.Yet Ms Truss is almost right in one respect. The British public has been moving slowly and steadily in a more social democratic direction in recent years. The publication this week of the 40th annual British Social Attitudes survey provides some of the evidence. It reveals, for instance, that the public does not only want government to fund health care and pensions, it also wants it to reduce income differences between the rich and the poor. The public supports further increases in taxes and spending in order to fund public services too, in spite of the fact that taxes are already high by historic standards.These are significant findings. As the blogger Sam Freedman pointed out this week, they result from observable, real world changes like the growth of food bank poverty, not some elite conspiracy. The implications for Labour are therefore encouraging. They suggest that there is some space for a new government to tax and spend more in pursuit of some of its priorities. Parts of the net zero agenda that has dominated the news in the last few days are an obvious example. But this will only be the case as long as the public agrees with the priority and trusts the government to spend wisely and fairly.Attitude surveys always need to be invoked with care. They do not provide governments with a carte blanche. Although majorities identify with the more progressive views quoted above, this is not a consensus. On most measures, at least a third of the public (and often more) takes a different view. And what goes up can come down. While the general shift in opinion under the Tories has been in this more social democratic direction, history suggests that this goes into reverse when Labour is in power. Public attitudes are not dogmatic.Some similar light and shade applies in the BSA\u2019s findings on the growth of liberal views. Attitudes to transgender people have hardened in the past three years, but overall public acceptance of nontraditional family forms and sexual relationships has moved a long way over 40 years. Today, 67% think a sexual relationship between two people of the same sex is never wrong; back in 1983 the figure was 17%. Support for a woman\u2019s right to choose whether to have an abortion has risen from 37% in 1983 to 76% today.None of this implies for a moment that there are not still battles to fight, and arguments to be won, or that any of these things will happen on their own, without human courage and political campaigning. On the contrary. Yet the attitudes survey tells a better story about this country than, understandably, the ones we so often have to face. It reminds us this is still a nation rich in possibilities. A better Britain is in front of us, if we choose.",

Since Roman times, creamy-white Carrara marble has been dug out of these mountains. It is the most sought-after marble in the world, and has inspired artists and architects everywhere.The Italian alpine newt (Ichthyosaura alpestris apuana). Photograph: Manuel MicheliBut the Apuan Alps also host an ecosystem that is home to the Italian alpine newt (Ichthyosaura alpestris apuana). In November, Manuel Micheli, a photographer working with the Apuane Libere organisation, stumbled across the newt in Crespina 2, a decommissioned quarry.\u201cBetween my feet, I found a small newt out of the water. Looking closer, I saw several dozen of them,\u201d he says. The newt is protected by Italian law and categorised as \u201cnear threatened\u201d on the IUCN red list of threatened species.\u201cIt was incredible to discover such a group,\u201d says Gianluca Briccolani, the co-founder of Apuane Libere, a volunteer organisation formed in 2021 to protect the mountains from environmental degradation, including water contamination caused by the heavy industrialisation of the marble industry.A volunteer from Apuane Libere waves the group\u2019s flag above a quarry in Carrara, Italy. Photograph: Manuel MicheliCava Crespina 2 lies under Monte Sagro and overlooks the Mediterranean. It was closed in 2014 and became a perfect place for newt reproduction thanks to an underground spring and rainwater filtration in conjunction with the lake\u2019s impermeabilisation, caused by marble dust waste (marmettola).Since Micheli\u2019s discovery, the newt population has grown \u2013 and the scientific and local community has mobilised to protect the newts. Plans to reopen the quarry were halted earlier this month by Unesco and the Apuan Park.\u201cLast year, we counted at least three dozen newts in different life stages,\u201d says the herpetologist Gabriele Martinucci. \u201cThis was a sensational discovery because it means they live in the quarry throughout the entire year. It\u2019s a demonstration that, even in places transformed by industrial activities, nature can give life to something that wasn\u2019t there, such as the newts.\u201d But campaigners worry that the quarry could be reopened in the future.The lake inside the Valsora quarry, now partly closed to safeguard a colony of Italian alpine newts. Photograph: Manuel MicheliIn another nearby quarry that is active, the owner has experimented with extracting marble during the week, and at the weekend opening the quarry to visitors who want to see the newts \u2013 and are willing to buy an \u20ac8 entry ticket.If the Crespina 2 quarry were to reopen, however, the newts there would need to be moved because the excavation would affect the lake where they live, says Apuane Libere.\u201cWe want to do everything to protect the newts,\u201d says Briccolani. \u201cMarble quarrying has nothing to do with art. Entire blocks of marble are crushed to create the calcium carbonate that we find, for example, in our toothpaste. The well-known Carrara marble is no longer used to make the future Davids by Michelangelo, but ends up crumbled or, at most, in the kitchens and bathrooms of a very few rich people.\u201dA crowd gathers to protest against the reopening of quarries near Lucca in Tuscany. Photograph: Manuel MicheliIt isn\u2019t just newts that are threatened, say campaigners. The Apuan Alps chain hosts about 30% of endemic national flora, including a rare cornflower that grows on the slopes of Mount Borla. But the newts have become \u201ca symbol of the resilience of Apuan biodiversity\u201d, says Andrea Ribolini of the Italian Alpine Club.Frog back from the dead helps fight plans for mine in EcuadorRead moreMany of those protecting the environment in the area are the children of former quarry workers, including Alberto Grossi, a longstanding activist and group manager for the Apuan Alps of the Legal Intervention Group, an Italian ecological association. \u201cEven if we come from families of quarry workers, now we hate this current system,\u201d he says.Guido Dazzi, a fellow environmentalist, says: \u201cI\u2019m 60 years old and my father was a quarry worker.

However, in order to keep consuming ecological resources at our current rate we would still need the equivalent of 1.6 Earths.\u201cEarth Overshoot Day is a way to illustrate the scale of the biological challenge we face,\u201d said Mathis Wackernagel, president of Global Footprint Network. Although Wackernagel said this year\u2019s data was encouraging, he called for further progress to be made \u201cby design not by disaster\u201d.People want a greener, happier world now. But our politicians have other ideas | George MonbiotRead moreThe three week shift between the dates of Earth Overshoot Day in 2019 and 2020 represents the greatest ever single-year shift since global overshoot began in the 1970s. Since then, rising populations and increasing levels of per capita consumption have seen Earth Overshoot Day move earlier into the year, with the date arriving in July for the first time in 2019.\u201cIt\u2019s a Ponzi scheme, we\u2019re using up the future to pay for the present,\u201d said Wackernagel. \u201cMost countries have pretty strict laws about businesses running Ponzi schemes but somehow in the ecological domain we think it\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve only got one planet and that\u2019s not going to change. We\u2019ve got a very simple choice, one-planet prosperity or one-planet misery.\u201dPrevious economic crises have seen the date pushed back temporarily, such as the 2007-08 financial crisis which saw the date retreat five days further into the year.David Lin, who leads the research team behind Earth Overshoot Day, explained: \u201cThis year it was particularly tricky because we wanted to give an indication of how Covid-19 affected 2020 results\u201d.Lin\u2019s research found that there was a major drop in CO2 emissions (down 14.5% compared with the same period in the previous year), and in commercial forestry (down 8.4% on 2019).Mike Childs, head of policy for Friends of the Earth, warned that \u201cthis year\u2019s improvement in the way we use our natural resources is solely down to Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns.

Lead can leach into the water from the pipes as the water travels through them.Revealed: the \u2018shocking\u2019 levels of toxic lead in Chicago tap waterRead more\u201cThere is no safe level of lead,\u201d said Joan Matthews, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, which co-authored the report as part of the New York City Coalition to End Lead Poisoning.A potent neurotoxic metal, lead can cross the blood-brain barrier, causing a host of neurological problems in young children, including behavioral disorders and lower IQ levels. \u201cLead in drinking water can be a significant exposure path, particularly for infants who are drinking formula,\u201d Matthews said. Adults can also suffer serious consequences from lead exposure, including high blood pressure and kidney damage.Brooklyn and Manhattan are the boroughs with the highest estimated number of lead service lines, at 46% and 44% respectively. Nearly a quarter of all water lines in the Bronx are confirmed to have lead. At a neighborhood level, Staten Island\u2019s Port Richmond community has the highest concentration of lead water lines in the entire city, at roughly 61%.The new report is based on data from the city\u2019s department of environmental protection (DEP), which includes a publicly accessible map of every property in the city. The report identified water lines as \u201cpossible lead\u201d if there is no record or conflicting records about the material type.New York City banned lead pipes in 1961 as public awareness of the dangers of lead exposure grew, and a national ban went into effect in 1986. But pre-existing lead service lines remain in use.\u201cNew York City treats replacing lead service lines as something extra, as an add-on work, and instead they need to acknowledge that this work needs to be done to protect the public health,\u201d Matthews said.The New York City Coalition to End Lead Poisoning is hoping the report will push the city council to pass a law requiring the replacement of all lead pipes in the next decade.The city of Newark, New Jersey, passed an ordinance in 2019 which helped replace 23,000 lead service lines in less than three years, under a city-funded program that covered the full cost.\u201cI\u2019m hoping New York follows the good practices that Newark has done and does it in a very aggressive, nation-leading way,\u201d said Josh Klainberg of the New York League of Conservation Voters, which also co-authored the report.",

The rare birds have historically been killed by gamekeepers and others because they predate on grouse populations, which are maintained for shooting.Members included the Moorland Association, helmed by Mark Cunliffe-Lister, the Earl of Swinton, who runs a grouse shoot on his estate. Its board also includes the viscount Matt Ridley, who owns a grouse moor and has suggested global heating is good for the planet.There is no suggestion either of them had anything to do with raptor persecution. Others in the partnership have included the RSPB, the National Trust and the Peak District National Park Authority, though the RSPB stood down from it in 2018.The group aimed to increase the number of raptors, such as hen harriers, peregrines and goshawks, to numbers seen in the 1990s. However, it failed to do so and incidents such as shooting, poisoning, trapping, nest destruction and the disappearance of satellite-tracked birds active within the Peak District have featured in every year of the initiative\u2019s monitoring.Phil Mulligan, the chief executive of the Peak District National Park Authority, blamed illegal persecution for the endeavour ending.He said: \u201cFeaturing at the very top of local ecosystems, these species like the hen harrier, peregrine and goshawk should be a flagship for landscapes and habitats at the heart of nature\u2019s recovery.\u201cThe fact that the work of the initiative has failed to reflect those target populations of some 30 years ago remains a cause for real concern, and it is without question that illegal persecution targeted towards some of these species is one factor behind this stuttering progress.\u201cI would like to extend my thanks to those who have put their time, energies and passion into the painstaking study, sharing of information and analysis of our raptor populations during the initiative\u2019s existence, but we must now look at alternative ways to ensure our birds of prey have a future in the Peak District \u2013 free from the risk of illegal actions.\u201dAmanda Anderson, the director of the Moorland Association, said: \u201cWe are very disappointed that the National Park Authority has decided to close down the Peak District bird of prey initiative.

        "text": "The UK government has weakened energy efficiency targets for farmers after lobbying from the National Farmers\u2019 Union.The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) had proposed a 40.9% energy efficiency improvement target for horticulture and a 12% target for poultry in order to cut the carbon footprint of the farming sector and reduce the reliance on fossil fuels to heat greenhouses and sheds.The government has now reduced those targets to 13% for horticulture and 10% for poultry. Experts have warned this measure will cost growers more in the long run as they will have to pay high energy prices.Lydia Collas, a senior policy analyst at the thinktank Green Alliance, said: \u201cDiluting energy efficiency targets for horticulture will do little to help growers who are struggling to turn a profit. Some didn\u2019t plant last year because energy prices were so high that they knew they wouldn\u2019t recover costs. With less support to cut energy use, their costs will stay high, as will their emissions. This will undermine the competitiveness of UK horticulture as a whole and incentivise imports.\u201dFarming campaigners are celebrating, however, referring to the reduced targets as \u201csustainable energy practices\u201d.The NFU\u2019s deputy president, Tom Bradshaw, said: \u201cThe revision of these targets is a win for collaboration and the commitment to sustainable energy practices, and they are now fair and realistic for the horticulture and poultry businesses involved in the scheme.\u201dThe energy efficiency targets are voluntary and part of the climate change agreement scheme, which is an agreement between UK industry and the Environment Agency to reduce energy use and carbon dioxide emissions. In return, those who contribute to the scheme receive a discount on the climate change levy, a tax added to electricity and fuel bills.The NFU\u2019s energy managing director, Tim Crocker, said: \u201cThis is a significant victory for horticulture and poultry businesses participating in the climate change agreement scheme. By working collaboratively with both members and the NFU it meant that we could successfully advocate for revised reduction targets that accurately reflect the challenges faced by businesses in the last target period. We, at NFU Energy, extend our gratitude to all those that have contributed to this achievement.\u201dAbout 10% of the UK\u2019s net greenhouse gas emissions come from the agriculture industry.A DESNZ spokesperson said: \u201cOur climate change agreements, backed by \u00a3300m of support each year, help more than 2,500 businesses improve their energy efficiency and reduce their costs in the long term. Revisions to initial targets have always been part of its design to ensure they remain stretching, while reflecting any unforeseen challenges. We extended the scheme earlier this year to help a range of businesses with their energy costs at a time of increasing pressures.\u201d",

Sperm concentration levels have dropped by 51% in recent decades, and the Rutgers study is among the first \u201cto suggest that the air around is contributing to that, as well\u201d, Barrett added.PM2.5 is among the most common and well-studied air pollutants, and is linked to cancer and respiratory and circulatory disease. Among common sources are diesel exhaust, heavy industry emissions and wildfires, and the Environmental Protection Agency is poised to lower ambient air limits as evidence of its toxicity at smaller exposures becomes clearer.Nitrogen oxide is a common toxin linked to cardiopulmonary disease, decreased lung function growth in children, asthma and other respiratory ailments. Among common sources are heavy industry, like power plants, and traffic.In animal studies, anogenital distance is used to determine developmental toxicity of pollutants \u2013 reduced distances are a sign that a toxic exposure is interfering with fetal testosterone production.Researchers suspected that the same might hold true in humans and pulled anogenital distance data from The Infant Development and Environment Study (Tides), an ongoing study of about 700 pregnant women and their children launched in 2010 in Minneapolis; Rochester, New York; San Francisco and Seattle. It tracks anogenital distance at birth in children, and at one year for boys.The study compared Tides data with air pollution levels in the residential neighborhoods where the study\u2019s participants lived. Researchers identified a link between elevated PM2.5 exposure during the \u201cmale programming window\u201d at the first trimester\u2019s conclusion and anogenital distance.The male fetus typically develops testosterone during this period, and that affects anogenital distance at birth.\u201cTestosterone is really important for the development of the male reproductive system, and anything that disrupts that normal testosterone surge during gestation has the potential to then have a cascade of effects that impacts all future reproductive development,\u201d Barrett said.The researchers also found a link between PM2.5 exposure during \u201cmini puberty\u201d, a period in early infancy when hormone production is high, and shorter anogenital distance in males at one year old.PM2.5 may also carry other toxins, like cadmium and lead, that interfere with hormone production. Though the study didn\u2019t include women, those women with longer anogenital distances are at higher risk of polycystic ovary syndrome, Barrett said.The best way for pregnant people to protect their fetuses is to follow air quality advisories and stay indoors when pollution levels are high. N95 masks can be used outdoors, and furnace filters with a rating of MERV 13 are effective at reducing indoor air pollution.Policymakers and regulators should also be doing more to rein in pollution and not leaving it to individuals to protect themselves, Barrett added.\u201cThis is a public health issue that impacts all of us and there should really be a nationwide and worldwide effort to reduce air pollution,\u201d she said.",

The poles will take a little longer \u2013 the ozone layer will fully bounce back by 2045 over the Arctic and by 2066 over the Antarctic.Following alarm over the loss of ozone in the 1980s, the ozone layer has been steadily improving in the wake of the 1989 Montreal protocol, an international agreement that has helped eliminate 99% of ozone-depleting chemicals, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that were used as solvents and refrigerants.The UN said the action taken on the ozone layer had also bolstered the more ponderous response to the climate crisis \u2013 CFCs are also greenhouse gases and their continued uncontrolled use would have raised global temperatures by as much as 1C by the middle of the century, worsening an already dire situation where planet-heating gases are still not declining.\u201cOzone action sets a precedent for climate action,\u201d said Petteri Taalas, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, which unveiled the progress report, which is conducted every four years, on Monday. \u201cOur success in phasing out ozone-eating chemicals shows us what can and must be done as a matter of urgency to transition away from fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gases and so limit temperature increase.\u201dThe unified global response to dealing with CFCs means that the Montreal agreement should be considered \u201cthe most successful environmental treaty in history and offers encouragement that countries of the world can come together and decide an outcome and act on it\u201d, according to David Fahey, a scientist at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who is a lead author of the new assessment.The progress has not always been smooth \u2013 in 2018 scientists detected an uptick in CFC use, which was tracked to China and eventually remediated. Meanwhile, the replacement of CFCs with another group of industrial chemicals, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), was problematic as HFCs are greenhouse gases, requiring a further international agreement, struck in Kigali, to curb their use.The hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica is seen in a series of satellite images over a 21-year period. Photograph: ReutersFahey said that even with swift global action on CFCs, the chemicals still linger in the atmosphere for about a century. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like waiting for paint to dry, you just have to wait for nature to do its thing and flush out these chemicals,\u201d he said.The challenge when it comes to greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide is even greater, he said, as they stay in the atmosphere far longer and, unlike CFCs which were produced by just a handful of companies, the emissions coming from fossil fuels are far more widespread and embedded in almost every activity in societies.\u201cCO2 is another order of magnitude when it comes to its longevity, which is sobering,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting every person on the planet to stop burning fossil fuels is a vastly different challenge.\u201dThe latest UN progress report is the first to look at the potential impact upon the ozone layer of solar geoengineering, a proposed climate intervention where reflective particles, such as sulphur, are sprayed en masse into the atmosphere to deflect sunlight and therefore reduce global heating.The controversial practice, which the US government is looking to research, has the potential to reduce global temperatures but could have \u201cunintended consequences, including effects on ozone\u201d, the report finds, although it acknowledges \u201cmany knowledge gaps and uncertainties prevent a more robust evaluation at this time\u201d.Fahey said that adding large amounts of sulphur to the stratosphere could reduce ozone, although probably by less than 10% and would not cause a \u201ccollapse\u201d in the ozone layer.\u201cThese sort of climate interventions are touchy subjects because they are a tangled ball of ethics and governance, rather than just science,\u201d he said. \u201cThere would indeed, though, be consequences for ozone if you put enough sulphur into the atmosphere. It would be unavoidable.\u201d",

He is the older brother of Naftali Bennett, the former entrepreneur who became a far-right politician and served as the prime minister of Israel for a year until last June.The trucks built this year in Tilbury will go to customers including the Royal Mail and the builders\u2019 supplier Travis Perkins, with the aim of selling 1,000 vehicles in 2023. It has had test vehicles on the road with the delivery company UPS since late 2019.Decarbonising lorries will be a crucial part of the world\u2019s efforts to reach net zero carbon emissions. About 19% of the UK\u2019s carbon emissions from transport in 2020 were from heavy goods vehicles, according to the Department for Transport.However, truck manufacturers are lagging behind carmakers in preparing for the transition away from fossil fuels because batteries have been too heavy and expensive to use at the scale needed in a lorry travelling long distances.Tevva is not the first company to produce electric lorries in the UK: the Dutch lorrymaker DAF Trucks builds its 19-tonne LF Electric at its Leyland subsidiary in Lancashire. However, DAF is not producing hundreds of trucks a year on a production line.The Tevva trucks will have a 140-miles range from a 105kWh battery, which is nearly double the size of those used in a standard electric car.Tevva, which has been backed by investors including the Indian conglomerate Bharat Forge, is also planning to build hydrogen-powered lorries that would be capable of refilling more quickly than battery lorries can charge, potentially allowing them to tackle longer distances. Those lorries would come in 12- and 19-tonne models, with production of the latter scheduled to start in Tilbury in 2024.Tevva\u2019s hydrogen-powered lorry.

EU leaders, including the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will be there, but the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has not confirmed whether he will attend.Macron believes current systems of development finance, including overseas aid from rich countries and climate finance to help poor countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather, are not delivering results.\u201cThe fight against poverty, the decarbonisation of our economy in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and the protection of biodiversity, are closely intertwined,\u201d he said, setting out the terms for the two-day summit. \u201cWe therefore need to agree together on the best means to address these challenges in the poor and emerging countries of the developing world, when it comes to the amount of investment, to comprehensive reform of infrastructure like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and public and private funds, and how to set a new process in motion.\u201dMia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, will also play a leading role. Her proposals, known as the Bridgetown agenda, are aimed at massively expanding the funding available to developing countries, particularly those afflicted by the climate crisis.Mottley has fiercely criticised the World Bank, IMF and similar institutions, most of which were set up in the final days of the second world war, calling them unfit for the 21st-century task of tackling the climate crisis and drawing countries out of debt and poverty. \u201cThe international community\u2019s responses are currently fragmented, partial and insufficient,\u201d she said. \u201cWe therefore call for a fundamental overhaul.\u201dCalls have been growing from many countries, including the US, the EU and UK, for an overhaul of the World Bank. The former president David Malpass, appointed in 2019 by the then US president, Donald Trump, resigned earlier this year after deepening controversy over his apparently climate-sceptic views.The summit will be the first major international outing for his successor, Ajay Banga. Banga, a former Citigate banker and ex-chief executive of Mastercard, is seen as likely to open the institution to widening partnerships with private investors, and shake up the bank\u2019s attitude to the climate and related crises.But it is not yet known how far he is likely to agree with Mottley\u2019s calls for complete overhaul, including targeting $1tn of new investment in poorer countries, $3tn (\u00a32.35tn) or more for climate finance globally, debt relief for the most indebted nations, and long-term finance over the next 30 years for building resilience to climate impacts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This reimagined and reformed global financial system would suspend debt service repayment when natural disaster strikes whilst also using the balance sheet of multilateral banks to leverage private sector finance to build resilience against climate breakdown,\u201d he said.As the world grapples with severe food shortages, with more than 250 million people facing acute food insecurity, exacerbated by the climate crisis, hunger must also be a key topic at the talks. Alvaro Lario, the president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, said: \u201cThis summit offers an overdue opportunity to revisit the rules of international finance, which are stacked against the world\u2019s poor, and which ignore their enormous contribution to global food security and global stability. It must find a way to catalyse private sector investment on a massive scale. Public funding alone cannot provide the $330bn to eradicate hunger by 2030.\u201d",

The UAE also has access to Pegasus spyware that can secretly take control of a person\u2019s mobile phone.Cop28 president denies on eve of summit he abused his position to sign oil dealsRead moreHedges said: \u201cTake a clean phone, a new phone with limited access. Do not have social media on your phone, or if you do, make sure it is a business account, with two-factor authentication, or something like this, and do the same for the safety, integrity of your emails.\u201dA phone used by the British academic was one of a list of 400 UK numbers that appeared on a leaked list of persons of interest to the UAE for potential targeting by mobile phone spyware two years ago, although the developer of Pegasus denied at the time this was the case.The greatest risk, Hedges continued, may be faced by sources and other people with whom journalists and campaigners communicate. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just you, it\u2019s anyone you are connecting with, because there are laws which restrict and criminalise working with international organisations that could be perceived to be critical of the government.\u201dParticularly controversial is the UAE\u2019s position as a host, given it is a major oil producer. Leaked emails published this week showed that the UAE was planning to use the climate event to pitch fossil fuel deals to foreign governments. Cop28\u2019s president, Sultan Al Jaber, on Wednesday denied the claims.But Hedges cautioned those hoping to protest against the UAE\u2019s hosting \u2013 or raise wider non-climate questions such as the war in Gaza \u2013 particularly beyond the event\u2019s core Blue Zone, which is managed by UN authorities rather than the host country for the duration of the event.The academic questioned whether protesters should even go to Dubai at all \u201cbecause the risks to you are physically too high, and I\u2019m saying that as a victim of this exact conversation\u201d and he urged campaigners to take individual responsibility.Hedges said: \u201cDon\u2019t be so easily swayed by the lines given to you by the state as well as your own government.\u201dIn August the UAE issued a joint statement with the UN promising to guarantee free speech, and later that Cop28 visitors would be permitted to \u201cassemble peacefully to have their voices heard in designated areas\u201d. The Gulf nation said in the statement it was \u201cone of the most tolerant and diverse nations\u201d.Last month the UK asked the host country to go further and explain how it would guarantee \u201cfreedom of opinion and freedom of expression and for peaceful assembly\u201d \u2013 and voiced disappointment the UAE had not agreed to make changes to its laws to guarantee those rights.Hedges said journalists and campaigners should ensure colleagues and close friends \u201cknow your diary\u201d and advised attenders in those categories to have a list of phone numbers on hand so \u201cshould anything go wrong you have the ability to reach out\u201d. A person who gets into trouble with the local authorities may not, he added, be able to rely on the UK Foreign Office. \u201cYou can see that from my experience,\u201d he said.In September, the Foreign Office apologised to Hedges for not recognising he had been tortured when British consular officials visited him while he was in custody. The UAE has said Hedges had been legitimately convicted of espionage and his accounts of torture were \u201cwholly untrue and without any foundation whatsoever\u201d.A spokesperson for the Cop summit said there would be space available \u201cfor climate activists to make their voices heard\u201d in line with UN guidelines and added that the UAE \u201cprotects the right to protest in line with relevant international agreements\u201d.

In 2022 the government approved a record-breaking 106 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-fired power capacity. One gigawatt is the equivalent of a large coal power plant.This run of approvals is continuing, potentially on track to break last year\u2019s record, according to analysis by the Global Energy Monitor (GEM) and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, published on Tuesday.It said in the first half of 2023, authorities granted approvals for 52GW of new coal power, began construction on 37GW of new coal power, announced 41GW-worth of new projects, and revived 8GW of previously shelved projects. It said about half of the plants permitted in 2022 had started construction by summer.The analysts said: \u201cUnless permitting is stopped immediately, China won\u2019t be able to reduce coal-fired power capacity during the 15th five-year plan (2026\u201330) without subsequent cancellations of already permitted projects or massive early retirement of existing plants.\u201dAnalysts have observed big advances in the renewable energy sector in China, which the government intends to make a mainstay of power supply, with coal in a supporting role.China is the world\u2019s largest producer of renewable energy, including wind, solar and hydroelectricity. But previous analyses have found infrastructure to store and distribute has not kept pace.Shortfalls in interconnectivity between regional grids, and issues with power supply for some areas mean energy driven by fossil fuels remains crucial for supporting grid stability or integrating variable renewable energy sources. However, the report says many or most of the approvals being rushed through are not in areas with those issues.\u201cSixy per cent of new coal power projects are in grid regions where there is already an excess of coal-fired power capacity,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe provinces adding large amounts of new coal-fired power are getting most of their added power generation from coal, contradicting the framing of coal power as a \u2018supporting\u2019 source for clean energy.\u201dCory Combs, an analyst at Trivium China, said authorities appeared to be prioritising uninterrupted demand and short-term economic recovery.\u201cThere is more development than there is need for development,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we look at it from an energy security perspective, [provincial level governments] they are putting an extremely high premium on short-term energy security. I don\u2019t mean systemic issues, [I mean] even making sure there\u2019s not even a two-hour power shortage.

Almost two-thirds of people live with pollution that is twice the WHO standard.Neira said politicians must act swiftly to reduce the scale and severity of pollution.\u201cAs a medical doctor, I cannot resist the temptation to remind people that this is about strokes, this is about heart disease, this is about asthma, this is about lung cancer, diabetes, low birth weight, preterm births, cognitive decline,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to remind people that any time you breathe, you are breathing something toxic into your body which is having a devastating impact.\u201dShe said it would not be acceptable for 98% of Europeans to be supplied with dangerously polluted water, and the same should be true for the air they breathe.\u201cPeople say our guidelines are very strict and very ambitious. But I don\u2019t see ambition in proposing something that will make so many people less sick \u2026 Having the knowledge we have [on the health impacts of air pollution] I think there is a clear and absolute moral responsibility.\u201dLast week the European parliament voted to adopt the WHO guidelines on PM2.5, but not until 2035.Neira welcomed the vote, but added: \u201cWe strongly urge countries to act swiftly, recognising that any shift in air quality levels will have a direct impact on public health, climate and the environment. Delaying these crucial measures will have severe and immediate consequences for people\u2019s wellbeing and the planet.\u201dThe Guardian investigation found that the worst-hit country in Europe is North Macedonia, where almost two-thirds of people live in areas with more than four times the WHO guideline levels of PM2.5. Eastern Europe is significantly worse than western Europe, apart from Italy, where more than a third of people living in the Po valley and surrounding areas breathe air that is four times more polluted than the WHO guideline levels.Europe\u2019s pollution divide: see how your area comparesRead moreJavi L\u00f3pez, a Spanish MEP with the centre-left group that led a recent push in the European parliament to adopt the WHO guidelines, said the Guardian investigation was \u201cproof that pollution is a visible pandemic in Europe\u201d.He said: \u201cA discussion about not only health, but a discussion about inequalities across Europe \u2013 between member states, but also social discussion between areas and classes \u2013 should be a top priority for administrations.\u201dIn the UK, three-quarters of the population live in areas where exposure to PM2.5 is between one and two times the WHO guidance.On Wednesday the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, announced he was watering down a swathe of environmental protections, including a plan to ban petrol and diesel cars from 2030.The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who has overseen the expansion of an ultra-low emission zone to cover the entire capital in an effort to improve air quality, said it was exactly the wrong time to row back on climate policies.\u201cWe are in a climate emergency, and this important investigation starkly highlights the scale and severity of air pollution across Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cToxic air is linked to hundreds of thousands of premature deaths a year, which is why I am rolling out some of the most ambitious policies of any city in the world to clean up London\u2019s air and tackle climate change.\u201dHe said the deadly impacts of pollution and climate change were becoming more and more apparent. \u201cThat is why we must act urgently, and why the government\u2019s moves to row back on environment measures flies in the face of common sense and shows they are climate delayers,\u201d Khan said.",

They were placed in kennels corresponding to their respective colony.Bats face meteorological dangers other than the cold. Rapidly changing weather, linked to global warming and the climate crisis, can kill bats from overheating or lack of food.Recent wildfires that have exceeded historical blazes in size and scope have razed precious bat habitat, according to the National Park Service. Outside of cities, bats residing in caves are at risk from sweeping rainfall as it can submerge roosts, wiping out whole colonies trapped inside.Earlier-than-normal freezing temperatures have also proved fatal to bats, with snow and ice trapping bats inside their caves. Cold snaps can even cause bats to freeze to death while they\u2019re hibernating in their roosts, the park service said.",

Similar behaviour was seen in response to the parrotfish model alone.The team say the results suggest that when a trumpetfish lurks close to a parrotfish, it is concealed from the damselfish.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It was going to be incinerated in the atmosphere at the start of this year. Now, after an appeal from forest experts, Nasa has changed its mind and extended the life of the mission.The sensor, roughly the size of a fridge, was put into storage last week in the International Space Station while another project completes its mission over the next 18 months. Survival heaters are being deployed to make sure critical components do not get damaged in the cold.It is understood that the sensor will be reinstalled and could last until the ISS is decommissioned in 2031, giving scientists more data on issues including how much carbon trees store and the effect of forest fires on the atmosphere.Researchers overseeing the project, based at the University of Maryland, said Gedi would have the chance to finish its work and calibrate its results with other satellites due to launch this decade that will monitor the planet\u2019s ecosystems.\u201cThe outpouring of support we received for keeping the mission alive was incredible,\u201d said Prof Ralph Dubayah, principal investigator on the mission. \u201cGedi has made over 20bn observations of the 3D structure of forests, over temperate and tropical forests.

It also improved the probability of survival after poisoning.\u201cWhile the results are promising, further clinical experiments are needed to determine whether indocyanine green has similar effects in humans,\u201d Wang said.A fungi expert and the chief scientist at Sydney\u2019s Royal Botanic Gardens, Prof Brett Summerell, who was not involved in the research, said death cap mushrooms were \u201cextraordinarily dangerous and toxic\u201d and were often mistaken for other mushrooms because of superficial similarities.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\u201cThe death cap can in the early growth stages resemble some of the straw mushrooms, which are \u2026 popular, particularly in a range of Asian cuisines,\u201d Summerell said.\u201cIn those early stages it can be quite difficult to differentiate the mushrooms,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a white creamy colour. As they get a bit older you can start to get a greeny-yellow tinge to them in the death caps.\u201cDeath caps have an association with the roots of oak tree, so if you see something that\u2019s under an oak tree, that\u2019s really when you need to be careful and suspicious.\u201dWhile the toxins found in some other mushrooms can be degraded by heat, death cap toxins are \u201crobust throughout cooking\u201d, he added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Another $185m will go on \u201csustainable landscapes programs\u201d.The failure to so far meet Biden\u2019s pledge risks undermining the White House\u2019s insistence that the US is committed to helping deal with the fallout of a climate crisis that it is a leading instigator of, through its huge historical and ongoing greenhouse gas emissions. Developing countries will need anything from $340bn to $2tn a year by 2030, according to various studies, to cope with the cascading impacts of global heating.Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, based in Bangladesh, said that the US\u2019 fair share of climate aid is far beyond even what Biden promised. \u201cSo one billion is really an insult to the developing countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe paltry allocation of only $1bn to support the developing countries is extremely disappointing.\u201dUS environmental groups have welcomed elements of the spending bill, including a large increase in the budgets of the Environmental Protection Agency and department of interior, as well as $600m for water infrastructure in Jackson, Mississippi, but criticized the glaring lack of climate aid.\u201cFunding levels for international climate aid are woefully inadequate to meet our global commitments or do our fair share to support under-resourced countries bearing the brunt of climate impacts,\u201d said Sara Chieffo, vice-president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters.Biden\u2019s administration had made the climate spending a priority, with John Kerry, the US\u2019s climate envoy, dispatched to lobby lawmakers. Both Biden and Kerry attended the UN Cop27 climate talks in Egypt last month and vowed the US would step up its assistance. \u201cThe climate crisis is hitting hardest those countries and communities that have the fewest resources to respond and to recover,\u201d Biden noted in his speech to delegates at the summit, repeating his promise to extract the required money from Congress.Administration officials say the goal is to deliver the assistance by 2024 and that money could come from other sources than direct appropriations from Congress. But the likelihood of doing this becomes far more remote once Republicans, who have largely rejected the idea of providing further aid for climate damages, gain control of the House of Representatives in January.A White House spokeswoman said that the $11bn target is \u201ca top priority for us and critical to the success of president Biden\u2019s climate agenda. And the president has made clear that he is going to fight to see this fully funded.\u201cOver the past several weeks and throughout the past weekend, members of the administration worked to secure funding in (financial year) 2023 that puts us on a path to achieving this goal.

And the problem is likely to get worse unless new, humane measures to curtail animal numbers are developed in the near future, say scientists.It is a critical environmental issue that will be debated this week at a major conference in Italy where experts will discuss how best to limit numbers of grey squirrels, wild boar, deer, feral goats, pigeons, parakeets and other creatures that are causing widespread ecological damage in many countries.A key approach to be highlighted at the meeting will be the need to develop contraceptives for animals. These would provide conservationists and farmers with a means to curtail animal numbers in a humane way, say researchers.Wild boar provide an illustration of the issues involved. Their numbers are rising across Europe, and UK breeding populations have been established in areas such as the Forest of Dean. With their large snouts and muscular necks, boar are good at rooting up fungi and seeds and can destroy crops, vulnerable habitats, ground-nesting animals and fragile root systems. Wild boar have also been linked to the spread of African swine fever to domestic pigs.The 2.7 million population of grey squirrels in the UK are threatening the native red species. Photograph: Krzysztof W/Getty Images/500px\u201cControlling numbers of animals like wild boar used to be achieved by shooting them, but hunting is not as popular as it used to be and is also more expensive, requiring expensive licences,\u201d said Dr Giovanna Massei, Europe director of the Botstiber Institute for Wildlife Fertility Control at York University.She added: \u201cNumbers of individuals who hunt animals are declining in many parts of Europe. As a result, controls of boar populations have weakened.\u201dOne solution is to develop boar contraceptives. \u201cPreventing these animals from breeding is a humane way to limit numbers,\u201d added Massei, who will be speaking at the European vertebrate pest management conference in Florence.In the US and Europe, scientists have launched projects aimed at developing contraceptive chemicals that could be mixed with food and would drastically limit boar fertility. \u201cIt is not easy to develop contraceptives but the good news is that once we get one, we have a way to deliver it,\u201d said Messai.The delivery method is known as the Boar-Operated System and it uses metal cones placed over dishes of food that only wild pigs can lift with their snouts. Other animals cannot access the plates. \u201cThat means we can get contraceptives into boar and only boar,\u201d said Massei.A similar approach has already been implemented to tackle grey squirrels. After the rodent was introduced to the UK from the US in the 19th century, its numbers have reached 2.7 million and it threatens to replace native red squirrels. Grey quirrels also cause considerable damage to UK woodlands by stripping bark from trees.Massei and other scientists are now carrying out research on an oral contraceptive in the form of a vaccine that prompts the squirrel\u2019s immune system to reduce the production of sex hormones, leaving both males and females infertile.Mixed with hazelnut spread \u2013 a top squirrel treat \u2013 the drug is placed in pots in feeding boxes that only they can access. The environment minister, Richard Benyon, recently argued that the project could help eradicate the grey squirrel in the UK \u2013 without killing them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Apart from the widespread crop and woodland destruction they cause, deer are involved in car accidents that injure an estimated 700 people a year: some due to collisions with vehicles, others because drivers swerved to avoid hitting the animals.Deer vaccines have been developed but problems remain about delivering them to their targets.The development of animal oral contraceptives will not be sufficient on their own to remove the problems posed by wildlife and human conflicts, admitted Massei: \u201cHowever, they will certainly be an important asset in dealing with the problem. The crucial point is that we have too many people and too many animals, and that is causing conflict.\u201cWe need to control numbers in ways that are publicly supported, and that means relying on non-lethal methods which are popular with the public.\u201d",

        "text": "Posing for the cameras with a photogenic dog is something of an election campaign cliche, but as Ed Davey picks up Marvin, an affectionately squirming norfolk terrier, the intended message is about something much less obviously appealing: sewage.The Liberal Democrat leader is posing with a series of dogs and their owners on Eastbourne beach, a local election stop intended to bring attention to an issue his party has campaigned on enthusiastically for the past two years, and with increasing cut-through.As Davey leads Marvin along the shingle, 60 miles away in west London the environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, is announcing a series of partly recycled policies to clean up waterways, an explicit acknowledgment of the damage the issue is causing to the government.Lib Dem research shows pollution outflows, both on beaches and into rivers and chalk streams, is one of the most pertinent issues for voters in affected areas ahead of the local elections on 4 May.Protesters outside a Thames Water sewage treatment works in Buckinghamshire. Photograph: Maureen McLean/Rex/ShutterstockJosh Babarinde, a Lib Dem councillor in Eastbourne who is also the candidate for the Conservative-held parliamentary seat, a key target for the party, says sewage is raised spontaneously as often as the NHS during local door knocking. \u201cIt is one of the most common issues that comes up on the doorstep. Beaches are the lifeblood of this town.\u201dSpeaking after the next leg in his day of campaigning, a tour around the vast and hi-tech warehouse of a locally based book wholesaler, Davey says sewage has even supplanted that perennial issue in local elections, the pothole.\u201cIt\u2019s much bigger than potholes,\u201d he said. \u201cPotholes are a very serious issue, and they do move votes, but for sewage, the reason why it\u2019s so dramatic is it brings the pollution of our natural environment and the damage that it\u2019s doing to our rivers and our seas, and wildlife and plants and animals, to human health.\u201dThe rise of sewage as an electoral issue is notable for several reasons, one of which is how the Lib Dems chipped away at it for so long without notable interest from other parties.It reached Lib Dem campaigners\u2019 radar when voters in Chesham and Amersham kept bringing it up before the party\u2019s stunning byelection victory over the Conservatives in June 2021, the starting point for the idea of a \u201cblue wall\u201d of vulnerable Tory commuter belt seats.\u201cWhen we started talking about sewage two years ago, the other parties though it was a bit weird,\u201d says one Lib Dem official. \u201cBut now they all want to talk about it.\u201dThis is very much the case. Last week, before Coffey\u2019s plan for cleaner water emerged, a group of Conservative MPs representing Sussex seats met jointly with Southern Water and the Environment Agency in an attempt to spur action on a subject many fear is electorally damaging to them.Labour, too, is very much aware of the subject, with Keir Starmer accusing the government last week of \u201cturning Britain\u2019s waterways into an open sewer\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The NOAA monitors global temperatures and records on a monthly and an annual basis, not daily.\u201cWe recognise that we are in a warm period due to climate change, and combined with El Ni\u00f1o and hot summer conditions, we\u2019re seeing record warm surface temperatures being recorded at many locations across the globe,\u201d the NOAA said.Nevertheless, scientists agree they indicate climate change is reaching uncharted territory and that the increased heat from anthropogenic global heating combined with the return of El Ni\u00f1o would lead to more record-breaking temperatures.The UN confirmed the return of El Ni\u00f1o, a sporadic weather pattern, on Tuesday.

In parts of China, an enduring heatwave has continued, with temperatures reaching above 35C.Overall, one of the largest contributors to this week\u2019s heat records is an exceptionally mild winter in the Antarctic. Parts of the continent and nearby ocean were 10-20C (18-36F) higher than averages from 1979 to 2000.\u201cTemperatures have been unusual over the ocean and especially around the Antarctic this week, because wind fronts over the Southern Ocean are strong pushing warm air deeper south,\u201d said Raghu Murtugudde, professor of atmospheric, oceanic and earth system science at the University of Maryland and visiting faculty at the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai.Chari Vijayaraghavan, a polar explorer and educator who has visited the Arctic and Antarctic regularly for the past 10 years, said global warming is obvious at both poles and threatens the region\u2019s wildlife as well as driving ice melt that raises sea levels.\u201cWarming climates might lead to increasing risks of diseases such as the avian flu spreading in the Antarctic that will have devastating consequences for penguins and other fauna in the region,\u201d Vijayaraghavan said.With Associated Press",

Thanks to nest cameras, viewers can watch the female osprey incubate her egg on a livestream.Live webcam of a Poole Harbour Osprey nest platform.The birds of prey were once common across western Europe, but due to persecution by humans as well as habitat loss, they became locally extinct in the early 1800s. Their nests were historically plundered for their eggs, and the birds were shot for taxidermy. Today, they are still regularly shot for sport in southern Europe.Since 2017, experts at the Roy Dennis Foundation and Birds of Poole Harbour have been working to reintroduce them to southern England, by relocating adult birds from Scotland. There is a breeding population at Rutland Water in the Midlands, after a translocation programme that began in 1996, and after decades of conservation efforts there are now hundreds of ospreys in Scotland.Paul Morton from Birds of Poole Harbour said: \u201cTo know there\u2019s now an osprey egg in a Poole Harbour nest is just amazing. This is the culmination of seven years\u2019 hard work. Projects like this are always going to take time, but it\u2019s such a great feeling to know that the birds have reached this important milestone, and to see CJ7 incubating her first egg is stunning.\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot for them both to learn as new parents, and breeding success is certainly not guaranteed. However, everything we\u2019re seeing at the moment is looking really positive, and hopefully by late May we\u2019ll begin to see them feeding their newly hatched fledglings.\u201dIt is hoped that the pair will produce two more eggs over the next week, and then a 35-40 day incubation period beginswith the possibility of osprey chicks hatching by late May.Poole Harbour was chosen for the project because it has an abundance of fish for the birds to feed on. Ospreys from other parts of the UK have been known to pass through the harbour on their way to and from Europe on their migratory route, and they stop to hunt for grey mullet and flounder in the harbour\u2019s large shallow channels and bays.This pair flew to west Africa last autumn, and the Birds of Poole Harbour teamfaced a seven-month wait to see if they would return. The birds\u2019 passage to Africa is fraught with danger, including adverse weather conditions and illegal hunting. They both arrived at the beginning of this month and have settled to breed.",

It follows three back-to-back La Ni\u00f1a events, which are associated with higher rainfall and lower temperatures in eastern Australia.The next El Ni\u00f1o: when is it coming and how strong might this one be for Australia?Read moreThe bureau had previously described Australia as being on \u201cEl Ni\u00f1o watch\u201d. It said the change did not alter an existing forecast that there would be drier and warmer conditions across much of Australia this winter.It said sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean were at least 0.8C above the long-term average \u2013 a key threshold for an El Ni\u00f1o to form. Seven international climate models surveyed by the bureau, including its own, suggested sea surface temperatures would continue to rise in the region in coming months.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nDr Tom Mortlock, a senior analyst at Aon and adjunct fellow at UNSW\u2019s Climate Change Research Centre, said following the end of autumn \u201cwe can now be much more confident in El Ni\u00f1o model forecasts\u201d.\u201cWe know from the historical record that bushfire events are more likely during periods of El Ni\u00f1o, whereas floods and cyclones are less likely, but can still happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe concern now is that, with the long absence of El Ni\u00f1o and back to back La Ni\u00f1as, the landscape is preconditioned for bushfire with significant fuel growth occurring.\u201dThe bureau said all models suggested another climate driver, the Indian Ocean Dipole, may move into a positive phrase in winter. If so, this would typically further suppress winter and spring rain across much of Australia, and could exacerbate an El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s drying effect.There is evidence Australia has already started to dry after three straight years of above-average national rainfall. Last month was the country\u2019s second driest May on record.A study published last month suggested the climate crisis was likely already making El Ni\u00f1os and La Ni\u00f1as more severe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rivers burst their banks and thousands of acres of farmland lie submerged. By Thursday evening, an estimated 20,000 people had been left homeless and 13 were confirmed dead.It is just the latest weather disaster to hit the country. Six months ago, 12 people died on the southern island of Ischia in a landslide triggered by torrential rain. Eleven more were killed last September by flash floods in the central region of Marche.Last July, amid a heatwave and Italy\u2019s worst drought for at least seven decades, an ice avalanche in the Italian Alps killed 11.It is too soon for an attribution study to determine how much worse, or more likely, this week\u2019s floods were made by human-caused global heating.But across Europe, as atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide increase, so too does extreme weather \u2013 consecutive years of drought have afflicted farmers in Spain and southern France, while last year there were unprecedented heatwaves across the continent.\u201cClimate change is here and we are living the consequences. It isn\u2019t some remote prospect, it is the new normal,\u201d Paola Pino d\u2019Astore, an expert at the Italian Society of Environmental Geology (SIGEA), told Reuters.Experts say Italy\u2019s geography makes it particularly vulnerable to climate disasters: its varied geology make it prone to floods and landslides, while rapidly warming seas either side make it vulnerable to increasingly powerful storms, amid rising temperatures.The frontlines of the climate crisis have hitherto been in the global south, leading to the oft-repeated refrain that those least responsible for the climate crisis are facing the worst effects. But for Italy now, and probably soon the rest of Europe, the enemy is at the gates.Last August, a weather station near Syracuse on the southern island of Sicily recorded 48.8C, which is thought to be the highest temperature ever measured in Europe. While the world fights a losing battle to keep the increase in global average temperatures below 1.5C, in Italy average temperatures over the past 10 years are already 2.1C higher than in pre-industrial times.Coldiretti, a national farmers\u2019 group, says the number of extreme weather events recorded last summer, including tornadoes, giant hail stones and lightning strikes, was five times the number registered a decade ago. And, like in many parts of the world already feeling the impacts of climate breakdown, it is farmers suffering the most: last year\u2019s severe drought caused crop yields to fall by up to 45%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

However, a 2017 law mandates another lease sale by late 2024. Administration officials said they intend to comply with the law.Two other leases that were issued as part of the first-of-its-kind sale for the refuge in January 2021 were previously given up by the small companies that held them amid legal wrangling and uncertainty over the drilling program.Alaska political leaders have long pushed to allow oil and gas drilling on the refuge\u2019s 1.5m-acre coastal plain, an area seen as sacred to the Indigenous Gwich\u2019in because it is where caribou they rely on migrate and come to give birth. The state\u2019s congressional delegation in 2017 succeeded in getting language added to a federal tax law that called for the US government to hold two lease sales in the region by late 2024.Joe Biden, after taking office, issued an executive order calling for a temporary moratorium on activities related to the leasing program and for the interior secretary to review the program. Haaland later in 2021 ordered a new environmental review after concluding there were \u201cmultiple legal deficiencies\u201d underlying the Trump-era leasing program. Haaland halted activities related to the leasing program pending the new analysis.The Alaska industrial development and export authority, a state corporation that won seven leases in the 2021 sale, sued over the moratorium but a federal judge recently found the delay by the interior department to conduct a new review was not unreasonable.The corporation obtained the seven leases to preserve drilling rights in case oil companies did not come forward. Major oil companies sat out the sale, held after prominent banks had announced that they would not finance Arctic oil and gas projects.The coastal plain, which lies along the Beaufort Sea on Alaska\u2019s north-eastern edge, is marked by hills, rivers and small lakes and tundra. Migratory birds and caribou pass through the plain, which provides important polar bear habitat and is home to other wildlife, including muskox.Bernadette Demientieff, executive director of the Gwich\u2019in Steering Committee, in a statement thanked the administration for the lease cancelation but said \u201cwe know that our sacred land is only temporarily safe from oil and gas development.\u201cWe urge the administration and our leaders in Congress to repeal the oil and gas program and permanently protect the Arctic refuge.\u201d",

Once in position on the Mall, they had planned to unveil their T-shirts and wave their flags as the royal carriage passed. A move that would have spread our demand to \u201cJust Stop Oil\u201d across the globe.One was arrested before they managed to meet up with the group. A further 13 were arrested on the Mall, before they had revealed their T-shirts and flags. Four more supporters and an independent journalist following the group were arrested outside Downing Street. The Met confirmed it had arrested a total of 52 people around the coronation for affray, public order offences, breach of the peace and conspiracy to cause a public nuisance.So while the world was looking forward to watching a 74-year-old billionaire receive a sparkly hat, the British state was arresting people for conspiratorially planning to reveal T-shirts and flags.Just Stop Oil was not the only group targeted at the coronation. Supporters of the anti-monarchy group Republic were also arrested and Animal Rising has said that about 20 of their supporters were arrested while attending a nonviolence training, miles away from the coronation. The group had confirmed on multiple occasions it would not target the day\u2019s events.Just Stop Oil supporters knew this moment was coming. The Public Order Act, further restricting the right to protest, is just the latest repressive legislation.

Yes, if you think that acting out of compassion for those on the frontlines of climate collapse is extreme, we\u2019re OK with that.Meanwhile, away from the media circus, the government is quietly signing off on more than 100 new oil and gas projects that will destroy the lives of hundreds of millions of ordinary people, while enacting laws to ensure that no one can stop them. It is ignoring the advice of climate scientists, the International Energy Agency and its own Climate Change Committee, who have all said, loud and clear: no new oil and gas if we are to avoid total climate breakdown. This government doesn\u2019t care about science, justice or reason.

We face policing at the whim of the home secretary, government by diktat and decree, and an increasingly hostile judiciary handing down disproportionately harsh sentences for peaceful protest. Make no mistake, this affects every one of us, regardless of our political persuasion.Arresting people for wearing T-shirts is a move worthy of a fascist state.

        "text": "Unilever is on track to sell 53bn non-reusable sachets containing anything from sauces to shampoo in 2023, breaking its commitment to switch away from single-use plastic, a report from Greenpeace has found.The global consumer goods group has committed to reducing its plastic footprint and has said it wants to create a \u201cwaste-free world\u201d. Under its former chief executive Paul Polman, who stepped down in 2019, Unilever positioned itself as a global leader on sustainability.Four years ago, the company\u2019s outgoing head of nutrition, Hanneke Faber, described the type of multilayer plastic found in sachets as \u201cevil\u201d because it could not be recycled.However, research by the environment NGO Greenpeace has found that despite Unilever\u2019s pledge to halve its use of virgin plastic by 2025, the company is on track to miss the target by nearly a decade.Nina Schrank, the head of plastics at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cUnilever really are pouring fuel on the fire of the plastic pollution crisis. Their brands like Dove are famous for telling the world they\u2019re forces for good. But they\u2019re pumping out a staggering amount of plastic waste. It\u2019s poisoning our planet. You can\u2019t claim to be a \u2018purposeful\u2019 company whilst bearing responsibility for such huge pollution. Unilever has to change.\u201dThe throwaway sachets of consumer products such as condiments, beauty and health products are marketed and sold in large quantities to the global south. Unilever says this is because \u201cin several of our markets, plastic sachets allow low-income consumers an opportunity to buy small amounts of products \u2013 often ones that provide hygiene or nutrition benefits like shampoo, toothpaste and food \u2013 which they would otherwise not be able to afford\u201d. The sachets, however, are also linked to pollution on land and in waterways, resulting in, for example, clogged drains, worsened flooding and threats to wildlife.Sachets produced by the Unilever brand Dove have been found polluting beaches and other waterways in the Philippines and Indonesia. Dove produced an estimated 6.4bn sachets in 2022.Greenpeace is urging Unilever to phase out single-use plastic in the next decade and begin by stopping the use of sachets. Greenpeace is also calling on Unilever to back a global plastics treaty the NGO says must include a legally binding target of cutting plastic production by at least 75% by 2040, based on a 2019 baseline, followed by a phase-down in the production.Marian Ledesma, a campaigner at Greenpeace Philippines, said: \u201cEach one of the many Dove sachets we found polluting beaches and waterways should be a badge of shame for Dove and Unilever. They can\u2019t continue to flood countries like the Philippines with waste they know can be devastating \u2026 Each sachet represents the enormous health risks, environmental degradation, social injustices and climate impacts caused by plastic production and the plastic life cycle.\u201cIf Unilever want to be seen as a leader, they should stop being part of the problem. They have to show they\u2019re serious and commit to phasing out single-use plastic, starting with sachets. And as treaty talks continue they must turn their influence on the world stage towards helping push for this level of ambition to sit at the heart of a strong global plastics treaty.\u201dA Unilever spokesperson said that tackling plastic pollution is a top priority for the company which is still making progress across all its plastic goals. The company is a member of the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, which is campaigning for an ambitious, legally binding UN plastic treaty. \u201cIn the past few years, we have rapidly increased our use of recycled plastic (PCR) in our global portfolio to 21%. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation recently called out Unilever as one of the businesses making the most progress to reduce its virgin plastic packaging footprint.\u201cWe\u2019re working on a range of solutions to reduce our use of plastic sachets, which are difficult to recycle, and replace them with alternatives. This is a complex technical challenge, with no quick fixes, and we are fully committed to working with industry partners and other stakeholders to develop viable, scalable alternatives that reduce plastic waste.\u201d",

Many analysts fear that without battery factories their existing car industries will eventually wither.The EU has estimated that the market for batteries will be worth as much as \u20ac250bn (\u00a3223bn) a year by 2025, and several of its member states are offering large subsidies to attract investments by carmakers and battery companies.However, the IRA subsidies put support from the EU or UK into the shade. Under the US act, battery cell manufacturers will be eligible for an \u201cadvanced manufacturing production credit\u201d worth $35 per kilowatt hour of annual capacity. For factories producing at the scale of gigawatt hours in annual capacity, that support could run to billions of dollars a plant.Volkswagen last week met senior EU officials as part of the European Battery Alliance, a body founded by the EU.

They are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down, and are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver conditions, immune disorders, birth defects and other serious health problems.PFAS pollution from a Chemours plant in North Carolina has widely contaminated the soil, water and air for hundreds of square miles around the company\u2019s Fayetteville Works plant, and residents say their exposure to the chemicals is behind elevated cancer levels and other serious health problems.Last year, a team led by Belcher found alligators in the region exposed to high levels of PFAS in the Cape Fear River exhibited signs of disease similar to lupus.Residents have also said they suspect their pets have gotten sick from exposure to the chemicals. Among them is Adrian Stokes, who last year told the Guardian he has watched helplessly as he, his cats and his dogs seemed to suffer from similar ailments.One cat repeatedly fell face-first into her food, he said, and another wobbled while it walked, which a vet attributed to unexplained kidney and neurological disorders. Two of his dogs had to drag themselves after losing use of their back legs, and Stokes put them to sleep.A few miles away, Fayetteville resident Mike Watters\u2019 three huskies died of pancreatic cancer, while area livestock owners have said they cannot find any other explanation as to why their horses have developed similar respiratory issues, and cattle were born deformed.The study was partly organized by concerned local residents and funded through the state. It zeroed in on dogs and horses who lived on properties with well water contaminated with high enough levels of PFAS that Chemours had to provide bottled water.The analyses of the pets\u2019 blood revealed biomarkers that suggest \u201cadverse kidney and liver impacts\u201d, Belcher said, though he underscored that it did not necessarily mean the animals were suffering from disease, and it\u2019s virtually impossible to prove causation. However, he noted the PFAS class has for decades been strongly linked to liver and kidney diseases.\u201cThe associations are all coming up the same,\u201d Belcher said.The study also showed differences in the type of PFAS compounds found in the blood of each animal, depending on whether they primarily lived indoors or outdoors, and whether they drank bottled or well water.Pets that lived outdoors, like horses, and those that drank well water showed higher levels of PFAS compounds produced at the nearby Chemours plant, like HFPO-DA, also called GenX. Pets that lived indoors and mostly drank bottled water had higher levels of PFOS, which is among the most toxic PFAS compounds. The PFOS likely came from exposure to indoor sources of contamination, like paint, stain guards or other products with PFAS.The findings also highlight how those who can afford bottled water can better protect themselves, Belcher said. In some cases pet owners were drinking highly contaminated well water and giving their pets the bottled water that Chemours was ordered to provide.\u201cPets mean so much to people,\u201d Belcher said. \u201cThe emotional impact that this contamination is having on the community is so much more massive than what I have appreciated.\u201d",

Then he backed a second referendum. Then he didn\u2019t. Now he wants to rejoin the EU in all but name.\u201d\u201cNo surprise \u2013 but good to have it said,\u201d said the Conservative peer and former lead Brexit negotiator, David Frost.Starmer\u2019s visit to Canada came after he visited The Hague for talks with Europol, after which he had said he would aim to negotiate a returns agreement with EU countries to send back some unsuccessful asylum seekers if Labour wins power.Earlier this week he was in Paris for talks with Emmanuel Macron and told the French president that he wanted to build an \u201ceven stronger\u201d relationship between the two countries.He had heralded the trip to Canada with an article in the Financial Times in which he committed to pursuing a major rewrite of the Brexit deal with the EU if Labour is elected, citing his responsibility to his children and future generations.A spokesperson for the Labour party said the comments in Montrealwere \u201cnot a new statement and the fact of the matter is that the Tories haven\u2019t taken advantage of Brexit to diverge on food or labour or environmental standards and if they are planning to do so then they should come clean and tell people that that\u2019s their plan\u201d.The party had been clear that it did not support what is known as dynamic alignment \u2013 the idea that the UK would follow evolving EU rules in an area indefinitely \u2013 and that any decision to align would be made in parliament, they added. Nor was the party saying it would rejoin the customs union or single market.Stella Creasy, one of Labour\u2019s more outspoken MPs in favour of closer relationships with the EU, and chair of the labour movement for Europe, the fastest growing party affiliate, reacted positively to Starmer\u2019s comments, tweeting: \u201cDivergence means more paperwork for British business \u2013 we should be reducing red tape and increasing access for trade and jobs not increasing it and making it harder for our economy to grow.\u201dStarmer\u2019s comments were made at an event alongside the Norwegian prime minister, Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, in answer to a question by John McTernan, a former senior Downing Street aide to Tony Blair.McTernan said he had asked the question because he was interested in the answer from both Starmer and the PM of Norway, another country outside the EU but with a close relationship.\u201cActually, Rishi Sunak yesterday aligned UK policy on internal combustion cars to the EU, so surely sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,\u201d he said referring to the prime minister\u2019s move to back the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars in the UK from 2030 to 2035, which brings the UK in line with countries such as France and Germany.",

Tackling it is a priority for Tory and Labour supporters, while half of all voters believe the government is not doing enough to get to net zero, according to polling by More In Common.The perception that \u201cred wall\u201d voters do not care about the issue is not backed up by the evidence. In fact, the opposite is true, with polls suggesting this group cares more deeply than others about the impact of rising temperatures on their families, jobs and country.\u201cBlue wall\u201d voters also believe that getting to net zero should be a priority, and adopting green technology such as electric vehicles and heat pumps is increasingly becoming part of their identity.\u201cIt would be a mistake for politicians to misinterpret the Uxbridge result and end up on the wrong side of public opinion,\u201d said Luke Tryl, the director of More in Common. \u201cOur polling and focus groups are clear. If the Conservative party were to deliberately tarnish its green credentials, it would risk further damaging the party\u2019s prospects with the two voting blocs they most need to win back: voters in the blue and red wall.\u201dSignals this week that Sunak could delay or abandon green policies that impose a direct cost on consumers could have a knock-on effect, undermining trust that the government will not suddenly do a U-turn on measures after people have already paid out.\u201cPoliticians dithering on climate risks being as dangerous to building consensus as outright opposition,\u201d Tryl said. \u201cMany voters still feel burned by the U-turn on diesel cars and are wary of being marched up the hill and forced to make expensive investments if politicians are just going to change their minds.\u201cThe mixed signals coming out of Downing Street over the past few days will have done nothing to reassure the public that the government is serious about transition and that they should start to make the changes in their lives.\u201dThere are other risks to the public consensus. The first is cost. While most Britons are alarmed by the climate crisis and would willingly take some personal steps and back government policies to help combat it, their commitment has limits if they are struggling.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Allowing these companies to pinkwash themselves is not the answer when they are part of the problem.\u201dOn Thursday, climate campaigners said they had lost count of the number of participants who had pulled out of the awards, after their letter-writing campaign to nominees had snowballed. They welcomed the awards organisers\u2019 announcement but said they would push ahead with protests outside the event on Friday night.Fossil Free Pride, which began the campaign earlier this month, said the awards must now drop sponsorship deals with HSBC, Santander and Macquarie Capital for their financing of the fossil fuel industry, as well as Amazon, Tesco and Nestl\u00e9. \u201cWe organised this protest to say that these events should be for queer people and not a parade of corporate logos,\u201d a spokesperson said.But there were claims the campaign was self-defeating for a marginalised community that needs resources to fight for rights and recognition.

About 3m tonnes of agricultural pesticides are used globally each year.The research identified that 82% of pesticides degraded into other molecules while 10% remained as residues in the soil. Another 7.2%, about 68,000 tonnes, leached into aquifers \u2013 rocks or sediment that hold groundwater.\u201cIn many observed cases pesticide active substances may degrade into a cascade of daughter substances which can be as toxic as the parent and occasionally even more persistent [in the environment],\u201d the scientists noted.The researchers estimated that 730 tonnes wound up in river systems each year, of which 710 tonnes made it to the world\u2019s oceans.The latter figure comprised only a tiny fraction \u2013 less than 0.1% \u2013 of the agricultural pesticides used in the studied catchments.\u201cAlthough this amount is less than 0.1% of net inputs, it is a cause of decreased species richness of stream invertebrates with little known consequences on near-coast ecosystems,\u201d the researchers noted.The US banned a brain harming pesticide on food. Why has it slowed a global ban?Read moreThe study\u2019s lead author, associate professor Federico Maggi of the University of Sydney, said even small amounts resulted in concentrations above safety limits.Along more than 13,000km of rivers, pesticide levels exceeded a safety threshold of 1 microgram per litre, with what the researchers say has poorly understood impacts on aquatic ecosystems.\u201cIt is not the pesticide use only that is important,\u201d Maggi said. \u201cWhat is important is the load \u2013 that is, the applied mass and toxicity of individual active ingredients.\u201dDr Francesco Tubiello, a study co-author and senior environmental statistician at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, said in a statement: \u201cWe must urgently adopt sustainable management strategies to promote reductions in field applications of harmful pesticides and set in place systems to effectively monitor their use under the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.\u201dThe study is published in the journal Nature.",

        "text": "Governments must get to grips with the links between the climate crisis and the plight of migrants around the world, experts have said, as increasingly extreme weather is a mounting danger to already vulnerable displaced people, and is potentially pushing more people to flee their homes.Migrants and displaced people number more than 100 million around the world, mainly in developing countries, and are among the populations most at risk from extreme weather.However, little work has been done on addressing the plight of migrants afflicted by climate breakdown, or on the risk that more extremes of weather will push more people into moving. The subject received little mention at the Cop27 UN climate summit in Egypt late last year, and experts are hoping for greater focus in 2023.David Miliband, the chief executive of the International Rescue Committee, said: \u201cWe have done a really bad job of working together on this. That\u2019s especially damaging given that these [migrants and displaced people] are the most vulnerable people, in conflict-driven parts of the world. These people have done the least to contribute to the climate crisis, but are among the most severely impacted.\u201dAt Cop27, governments agreed that the poor countries worst afflicted by climate breakdown should receive funds for \u201closs and damage\u201d, to help them recover and rebuild after extreme weather. Details on how the new global fund should operate are still to be worked out this year, but it must include some form of provision for migration, experts told the Guardian.\u201cThere is no doubt that some of the drivers of refugee numbers are conflict and climate change,\u201d said Miliband. \u201cClimate change has a direct and indirect effect on migration, and forced migration. It generally leads to internal displacement, to migration flows within countries.\u201dAbout 55 million people around the world are internally displaced within their own countries, more than the number who are fleeing across borders. Last year, the total number of forcibly displaced people around the world \u2013 including refugees fleeing across international borders \u2013 topped 100 million for the first time, according to the UN.Miliband warned that poor countries needed more funds to protect themselves from the effects of extreme weather, to help prevent people being forced to flee. \u201cWe must build resilience in these countries,\u201d he said.However, he added that scare stories of climate breakdown creating a new refugee crisis were overblown. \u201cI don\u2019t go for this language of climate refugees, as most are within [their own country] borders,\u201d he said. \u201cBut conflict and climate come together \u2013 climate change fuels conflict, and is a conflict multiplier.\u201dHow helpful is the term \u2018climate refugee\u2019?Read moreUgochi Daniels, the deputy director general of the UN\u2019s International Organization for Migration, also wants to see more focus on the links between the climate crisis and displacement.\u201cWe at IOM are extremely pleased with the collective solidarity that Cop27 delivered,\u201d she said. \u201cThe inclusion of migrants in the preamble [to the agreement] marks a significant step forward on the recognition of the centrality of human mobility towards successful adaptation [to the impacts of extreme weather].\u201dShe praised the resolution to set up a new loss and damage fund. \u201cWe see those developments as critical, in the years ahead, to save lives and mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, in particular in vulnerable countries.\u201dOn current forecasts, more than 200 million people are likely to be displaced around the world by 2030, by a variety of factors including the climate crisis. Most of them are likely to stay within their country borders, but the impact will be vast.\u201cThe impact of the climate crisis on human mobility is significant, and that must be recognised,\u201d said Daniels.The plight of women also needed more attention, she added. \u201cThere are particular impacts on women and children. Women are often in a vulnerable situation, and have less access to resources, whether that\u2019s money, land, education or health, and they are often in care-giving roles or bear the burden for their families.\u201dAndrew Harper, the special adviser on climate action at the office of the UN high commissioner for refugees, said rich countries must start taking seriously the need to help poor countries adapt to the effects of extreme weather, of which the consequences were now obvious. \u201cIgnorance is no excuse any more; we are seeing disasters now on a daily basis,\u201d he said. \u201cOne person was displaced every second last year. At what point do we start taking this seriously? When it\u2019s two people a second?\u201dClimate-related disasters last year included devastating floods in Pakistan that left more than 20 million people dependent on humanitarian aid, and severe droughts in the Horn of Africa, where close to 150 million people are facing extreme hunger.\u201cClimate change has turbocharged extreme weather events,\u201d said Harper. \u201cAnd those extreme weather events are in turn displacing people.\u201d",

The twins were asked to rate their familiarity with and desire to be in nature, and how frequently they visit natural spaces such as public parks and private gardens.The study, published in Plos Biology, found that identical (monozygotic) twins, who share almost 100% of their genes, were more similar to each other in their orientation towards nature and how frequently they visited nature compared with fraternal (dizygotic) twins, who share about 50% of their genetic material.However, heritability declined with age, perhaps showing that environmental factors such as access to nature and green spaces bring about a love of the outdoors as one grows older.While previous studies have found that spending time in natural spaces improves mental wellbeing, this varies from person to person. For the first time, the researchers say, this study has indicated why that is by suggesting there is likely to be a genetic component in our predispositions towards nature and our likelihood to visit natural spaces.England\u2019s poor urban areas have fewest protected green spaces, analysis findsRead moreThough proximity to nature increases the likelihood of having an appreciation for it, those with a strong disposition towards enjoying nature may actively seek it out even if it means travelling.The authors added that diverse urban planning is needed to provide access to natural spaces \u2013 and the benefits they offer \u2013 for all.\u201cSpending time in nature links to better health and wellbeing,\u201d Chang added. \u201cA twin study shows that a person\u2019s desire to be in nature and how often they experience it are influenced by both genes and personal experiences.\u201dThe TwinsUK database was set up by Prof Tim Spector from King\u2019s College London in 1992 to investigate the incidence of osteoporosis and other rheumatic conditions in several hundred identical twins, but the group now includes more than 15,000 identical and non-identical twins from across the UK.

They also pointed to his London mayoral campaign against Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan in 2016, which critics said relied on dog-whistle racism, to suggest he would probably not be accepted into the party anyway.Goldsmith raised particular concerns about suggestions the government could miss its commitment to spend \u00a311.6bn over five years on international climate schemes in developing countries.Official warnings have reportedly been made within Whitehall that an already \u201cstretching target\u201d had been turned \u201cinto a huge challenge\u201d given underspending in the run up to the 2026 deadline.Goldsmith, who is a close friend of Johnson, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great that the government is saying that they\u2019re committed to 11.6, but mathematically, it is impossible for us to meet that target. Unless the Treasury intervenes, unless the prime minister intervenes, it\u2019s simply impossible.\u201cIf you look at the trajectory of expenditure, in order to fulfil that promise the first year of the next government, which may or may not be this government \u2013 it might be the Labour party \u2013 will have to spend over 80% of all of its bilateral aid on climate finance and that it obviously is not going to happen.\u201dGoldsmith has not held his tongue since quitting the government at the end of June. Speaking to the Guardian last month, he criticised several cabinet ministers and accused Sunak of \u201ctalking to a particular gallery\u201d of climate-sceptic MPs.The prime minister has so far remained committed to the net zero by 2050 target, and resisted calls from some Tory MPs for the 2030 ban on new petrol cars to be delayed.He announced funding for carbon capture projects on a visit to Scotland last week.Though Sunak said net zero should be achieved in a \u201cproportionate and pragmatic way\u201d, he also said it was important to leave the environment in \u201ca better state than we found it in\u201d.",

        "text": "Conservatories and house extensions could be helping to wipe out the reductions in gas use secured by insulating homes, according to a study that found insulation only provides a short-term fall in energy consumption.In a surprise finding, the study into the long-term effect of loft and cavity wall insulation in England and Wales showed that the fall in gas consumption for each household was small, with all energy savings disappearing by the fourth year after it had been fitted.Policy experts at the University of Cambridge said the findings suggested a \u201crebound effect\u201d in energy use, where changing behaviour cancelled out the reductions in gas use. They also suggested that fitting insulation often happened alongside the building of house extensions, which use extra energy. For households with conservatories, any gains in energy efficiency disappeared after the first year.The government and opposition parties have championed the retrofitting of homes with insulation as a way of dealing with the energy crisis. Ministers have announced insulation retrofits as a leading part of a programme to reduce the energy consumption of buildings and industry by 15% over the next eight years. Labour has said insulating homes should be a \u201cnational mission\u201d that could save people \u00a311bn in three years.However, researchers said that while insulation was vital for fighting fuel poverty, it was not a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d for reducing energy use and should come alongside advice to conserve energy and programmes to install heat pumps in homes.Researchers said it was hard to identify the exact causes of the rebound effect. However, they stated that turning up the heating, opening windows in stuffy rooms or building extensions could all contribute. They made clear that in circumstances such as the current cost of living crisis, it was possible that energy savings from insulation could be more significant and longer lasting.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

France, for instance, installs 10 times as many heat pumps as the UK, where many people are unfamiliar with them and doubts about their efficacy have been widely publicised. Reports have spread that they do not work well in low temperatures despite their increasing use in Scandinavia and other cold climates.The research, published in the specialist energy research journal Joule, used data from seven field studies in North America, Asia and Europe. It found that at temperatures below zero, heat pumps were between two and three times more efficient than oil and gas heating systems.The authors said the findings showed that heat pumps were suitable for almost all homes in Europe, including the UK, and should provide policymakers with the impetus to bring in new measures to roll them out as rapidly as possible.Dr Jan Rosenow, the director of European programmes at the Regulatory Assistance Project and co-author of the report, said: \u201cThere has been a campaign spreading false information about heat pumps [including casting doubt on whether they work in cold weather]. People [in the UK] don\u2019t know much about heat pumps, so it\u2019s very easy to scare them by giving them wrong information.\u201dThe Guardian and the investigative journalism organisation DeSmog recently revealed that lobbyists associated with the gas boiler sector had attempted to delay a key government measure to increase the uptake of heat pumps.The UK government is consulting on proposals for incentives to households to take up heat pumps, which at about \u00a37,000 or more can cost two or three times as much up front as gas boilers. Boiler companies are also to be penalised if they fail to sell enough heat pumps, under a \u201cmarket-based mechanism\u201d that will require them to sell a certain quota of heat pumps or pay a penalty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

By 2050, water demand around the world is projected to increase by between 20% and 25%.The 25 countries under the most water stress include Saudi Arabia Chile, San Marino, Belgium and Greece. The five facing the highest water stress are Bahrain, Cyprus, Kuwait, Lebanon and Oman.A colour-coded map showing the extent of water stress on countries.Globally, about 4 billion people, or half the world\u2019s population, are exposed to extremely high water stress at least one month a year, according to the Aqueduct analysis. By 2050 the number could be closer to 60%.\u201cLiving with this level of water stress jeopardises people\u2019s lives, jobs, food and energy security. Water is central to growing crops and raising livestock, producing electricity, maintaining human health, fostering equitable societies and meeting the world\u2019s climate goals. Without better water management, population growth, economic development and climate change are poised to worsen water stress,\u201d the report\u2019s authors say.According to data from Aqueduct, 31% of global GDP \u2013 worth $70tn \u2013 will be exposed to high water stress by 2050, up from 24% ($15tn) in 2010. Four countries \u2013 India, Mexico, Egypt and Turkey \u2013 will account for more than half of the exposed GDP in 2050.The water risk research says increased water stress threatens countries\u2019 economic growth. It also affects food production. The research says 60% of the world\u2019s irrigated agriculture faces extremely high water stress, particularly sugarcane, wheat, rice and maize. By 2050 the world will need to produce 56% more food calories than in 2010 to feed a projected 10 billion people.In India, a lack of water to cool thermal power plants between 2017 and 2021 resulted in 8.2 terawatt-hours in lost energy\u2013 enough electricity to power 1.5m Indian households for five years.The report says interventions can stop water stress leading to water crises. Singapore and Las Vegas have been able to thrive even under the most water-scarce conditions, the report notes. Authorities there have saved water using desalination and other techniques such as wastewater treatment and reuse.Political will is needed to introduce water efficiency and reduce water stress, the report\u2019s authors argue.The 25 most water stressed countries are: Bahrain, Cyprus, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Botswana, Iran, Jordan, Chile, San Marino, Belgium, Greece, Tunisia, Namibia, South Africa, Iraq, India and Syria.",

        "text": " A chalk stream in Lewes, East Sussex, has been \u201crewiggled\u201d to restore its natural flow and create a public wetland.The Cockshut is a 1.9-mile long chalk stream that flows from the foot of the South Downs in Kingston, joining the River Ouse at Lewes before flowing out to sea.Diggers last week broke through an artificial riverbank, allowing water from the chalk stream to rush into the 7-hectare (17-acre) wetland area.The project forms part of a shared initiative by Lewes district council, Ouse and Adur Rivers Trust (OART) and Lewes Railway Land Wildlife Trust to rewiggle and realign the stream into a new channel, restoring its natural flow and reducing the risk of flooding.Peter King, the director of the OART, said the new channel would \u201callow the water to move through the system a lot slower\u201d and \u201cincrease the landscape\u2019s capacity to hold water\u201d.There are only 220 chalk streams in the world, an estimated 85% of which are found in England. However, a high proportion have been negatively affected by human activities.Alan Stewart, a professor of ecology at the University of Sussex, said past construction of straightened, artificial canals to transport vessels had increased the risk of flooding, noting that Lewes had a \u201cdevastating\u201d flood in 2000. The flood damaged more than 800 properties, including homes and businesses, and led to six days of power cuts.Stewart said removing artificial river banks and allowing streams to create their own natural winding courses was ultimately the most sensible approach to reducing flood risk.King said the Cockshut chalk stream was a site of special scientific interest that had been in \u201cunfavourable condition for a number of years due to the decreasing biodiversity across the site\u201d.An artist\u2019s impression of the completed Cockshut stream restoration project. Photograph: Cockshut Stream Restoration ProjectAccording to Stewart, one of the most important outcomes of the project would be the removal of a large floating mat of parrot\u2019s feather,, an invasive non-native plant that clogs up the stream, \u201coutcompeting native aquatic plant species and reducing the oxygen in the water\u201d.An ecological impact assessment has forecast that the creation of the wetland will boost the population of rare mollusc and dragonfly species that live there.There have already been reports of bird sightings by the channel. Emily O\u2019Brien, a local councillor, said: \u201cThe UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world, so to see birdlife already at the water\u2019s edge and know that so much other life will soon follow, it\u2019s incredibly exciting for everyone involved in this superb project.\u201dThe total cost of the project is just under \u00a3500,000, with funding provided by bodies including the district council, South Down national park authority and the Veolia Environmental Trust.According to King, the project is connected with other work by multiple partners to create new wetlands across the south coast of England and has been warmly welcomed by the local community.The project will be completed and accessible to the public by this autumn. This article was amended on 24 August 2023 to correct the number of properties damaged by the floods in 2000. The article originally put it at about 100; in fact, more than 800 buildings were damaged.",

        "text": "Three former executives from the company that operates the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant have had their not-guilty verdicts upheld by a court in Japan, dealing a blow to campaigners demanding the firm take legal responsibility for the disaster in March 2011.The Tokyo high court on Wednesday cleared Tsunehisa Katsumata, the former chairman of Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), along with former vice-presidents Ichiro Takekuro and Sakae Muto, of professional negligence resulting in death.The court said the defendants could not have predicted the massive tsunami that crippled the power plant and triggered the world\u2019s worst nuclear accident since Chornobyl in 1986.Fukushima water to be released into ocean in next few months, says JapanRead moreThe three men were indicted in 2016 for allegedly failing to take measures to defend the plant against tsunamis, resulting in the deaths of 44 people, including elderly patients at a hospital, who had to be evacuated after the disaster.The Fukushima Daiichi plant, on Japan\u2019s north-eastern coast, was hit by a massive tsunami caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake, the strongest in Japan\u2019s recorded history.More than 18,000 people died in the tsunami, but no one was recorded as having been directly killed by the nuclear meltdowns, which caused massive radiation leaks and forced the evacuation of more than 150,000 people living nearby \u2013 some of whom have only recently been given permission to return to their homes.Wednesday\u2019s ruling affirmed a similar verdict delivered by the Tokyo district court in September 2019.The trial focused on whether the former executives should have foreseen the massive tsunami and taken extra precautions, such as constructing a bigger seawall, to prevent a catastrophe.A government evaluation of earthquake risks published in 2002 estimated that tsunami waves of up to 15.7 metres (51ft) in height could strike Fukushima Daiichi. The findings were passed on to Tepco in 2008 \u2013 three years before the disaster when a 14-metre wave struck, the Kyodo news agency said.Tepco has argued it was powerless to take precautions against a tsunami of the size that struck the plant almost 12 years ago, and that it had done everything possible to protect it.The original district court ruling, however, cast doubt on the credibility of the government\u2019s evaluation, saying the defendants \u201ccould not have logically predicted tsunami waves over 10 metres in height\u201d, Kyodo reported.Although they have twice been acquitted in the only criminal case against Tepco executives arising from the disaster, a separate verdict in July in a civil case against the same three men and Tepco\u2019s former president, Masataka Shimizu, ordered them to pay \u00a513.32tn (\u00a380bn at the time) for failing to prevent the disaster.In contrast to Wednesday\u2019s decision, the court said the government\u2019s assessment had been reliable enough to oblige Tepco to take preventive measures.While that ruling \u2013 the first to find Tepco executives liable for damage resulting from the disaster \u2013 carries symbolic significance, lawyers have said the defendants do not have the means to pay the sum, believed to be the largest ever awarded in a civil lawsuit in Japan.Media reports said they would be expected to pay as much as their assets allowed.",

        "text": "The transfer of more than 1 million barrels of oil from an ageing tanker moored off the coast of war-torn Yemen has been completed, avoiding an environmental disaster, the UN has said.In a statement on Friday, Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesperson for UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said the operation had prevented a \u201cmonumental environmental and humanitarian catastrophe\u201d.An international team began siphoning the oil from the dilapidated vessel known as FSO Safer on 25 July. Almost all the oil is now aboard a replacement tanker called MOST Yemen.Before the transfer the Safer, which Yemen used as a floating storage and offloading facility, held four times as much oil as was spilled in the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster off Alaska, one of the world\u2019s worst ecological catastrophes, according to the UN.International organisations and rights groups warned for years of the potential for a spill or an explosion involving the tanker, which had not been maintained and has damaged pipes and seawater in its engine compartment.\u201cToday we can say that the United Nations and a remarkably broad group of partners have succeeded in preventing the worst-case scenario of a catastrophic oil spill in the Red Sea,\u201d David Gressly, the UN humanitarian coordinator in Yemen, said.It is moored 6km (3.7 miles) from Yemen\u2019s western Red Sea ports of Hodeida and Ras Issa, a strategic area controlled by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels who are at war with the internationally recognised Yemeni government.Rotting Red Sea oil tanker could leave 8m people without waterRead moreThe warring sides blamed each other for blocking a salvage operation to remove the oil until a UN-led initiative succeeded in accessing the ship and raising money from international donors.The transfer marks a major milestone in a plan that needs additional funding to transport the oil away and to move the Safer. The UN said a small amount of oil remained inside the Safer\u2019s hull and that the salvage team needed to install a secure system for mooring the replacement tanker in deep water.\u201cAs much of the 1.14m barrels has been extracted as possible,\u201d the UN statement said. \u201cHowever, less than 2% of the original oil cargo remains mixed in with sediment that will be removed during the final cleaning of the Safer.\u201dGressly told UN reporters at a video news conference from Yemen that during the cleaning phase a sea water wash would be applied \u201cto extract as much liquid oil as possible\u201d, and the oil-mixed sediment would then be removed at another port. It is unclear how long that next phase will take.The US welcomed the news of the operation\u2019s success and called on other countries to contribute to see the job through to the end.\u201cThe UN urgently needs the international community and private sector\u2019s financial support to fill the remaining $22m funding gap needed to finish the job and address all remaining environmental threats,\u201d the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said.The tanker, a Japanese-made vessel built in the 1970s, was sold to the Yemeni government during the 1980s to store for export up to 3m barrels pumped from oilfields in eastern Yemen\u2019s Marib province. The ship is 360 metres (1,181 feet) long with 34 storage tanks.Peter Berdowski, CEO of maritime services company Boskalis, said the Safer\u2019s former cargo was now inside a \u201cmodern double-hulled tanker\u201d. The UN contracted a Boskalis subsidiary, SMIT Salvage, to remove the oil.Berdowski congratulated the company\u2019s salvage team for \u201ccarrying out the work under very challenging conditions in the Red Sea\u201d.Yemen\u2019s ruinous civil war began in 2014 when the Houthis seized the capital of Sana\u2019a and much of northern Yemen and forced the government into exile.

A wave of thunderstorms and tornadoes in the US over the past few weeks have resulted in the deaths of at least 63 people.Rising global temperatures and moisture levels are likely to make the conditions for the formation of severe storms more favourable, but that does not necessarily mean more tornadoes.

But there are hopes this more efficient method carried out at scale will be more sustainable.The WRT team, including hundreds of volunteers, exploited the mink\u2019s keen sense of smell by suspending hollow practice golf balls inside each trap. These contained cigarette filters with one to two drops from the mink\u2019s anal scent gland, harvested from previously caught mink, which successfully lured other mink.The smart traps alerted their managers by text and email when the door closed, promoting a rapid response that improves animal welfare and reduces the need to check the traps every day.Dr Julie Hanna, a species conservation adviser for Natural England, the government\u2019s wildlife watchdog, which supported the trial, said: \u201cThe trial results are encouraging and we hope will help recover water vole populations, and benefit other species which have been affected by American mink.\u201cSpecies conservation strategies are a new provision under the Environment Act 2021 which will contribute to meeting the government\u2019s legally binding targets to halt species decline.\u201d",

One day earlier, the body of another person believed to be an asylum seeker was found in the same area.In recent days the fires have ripped through an area that had increasingly become a crossing point for thousands of refugees and migrants, Amnesty International said in a statement. Their arrival on EU soil had been \u201csystematically\u201d met with \u201cforced returns at the border, denial of the right to seek asylum and violence\u201d, it added.\u201cThe 19 people killed by wildfires in northern Greece appear to be victims of two great injustices of our times,\u201d said Adriana Tidona, a migration researcher with the organisation.\u201cOn the one hand, catastrophic climate change \u2026 On the other hand, the lack of access to safe and legal routes for some people on the move, and the persistence of migration management policies predicated on racialised exclusion and deadly deterrence, including racist border violence.\u201dThe presence of hundreds of asylum seekers in the fire-ravaged area was flagged this week by Alarm Phone. \u201cWe are in contact with 2 groups of around 250 people in total who are stranded on different islets of the Evros River,\u201d the NGO wrote on social media. \u201cThey say \u2018the fires are getting very close to us now. We need help as soon as possible!\u2019\u201dPleas for help had gone unanswered by authorities for days, it added. \u201cThey fear for their lives as the wildfires approach and the air is unbreathable.\u201dAs the wall of flames advanced through the forests, people had been left grappling with an impossible dilemma, said Vassilis Kerasiotis, the director of the NGO HIAS Greece. \u201cThe problem is that the asylum seekers have legitimate fears of being pushed back to Turkey. That\u2019s why they\u2019re hiding instead of going to the nearest Greek authority.\u201cThe fact that in the face of a fire, people are hiding in the forest instead of trying to get to safety tells you of the fear they have of being deported.\u201dAs Greek authorities increasingly seek to deter migration by creating what Kerasiotis described as a \u201chostile\u201d environment, asylum seekers are likely to have been pushed deeper into the forests, potentially amplifying the risks they face from the fires. \u201cThis is a clear example of the policy of fear, unfortunately,\u201d he said.Added to these dangers is a wave of racist incidents in which asylum seekers have reportedly been targeted, fuelled in part by social media posts such as that of a far-right MP who made baseless claims on Facebook that accused refugees and migrants of starting the fires.Soon after, three men were arrested for allegedly detaining 13 asylum seekers in a cargo trailer. Media linked the arrests to a video circulating on social media that showed a man unbolting the door of a cargo trailer to reveal what appeared to be several young people crouched inside. As the video rolled, the man linked them to the fires and encouraged others to \u201cround them up\u201d.On Tuesday, Greece\u2019s supreme court prosecutor, Georgia Adilini, said he had asked the prosecutor in north-eastern Alexandroupolis area to investigate the incidents of alleged racist violence.",

That first stage alone was worth $2bn, the council said.The project also accounted for more than a third of 1923MW of new installed capacity that reached financial close during the quarter. The tally was up about four-fold from the previous quarter, lifting the rolling 12-month average to its highest level in five quarters.The industry is relying on fewer but larger projects, if the latest trends are a guide.Last year 15 generation projects for a total of 3.57 gigawatts of installed capacity secured financial approval. In 2021 the tally was 23 projects for 3.06GW, the council said.NSW led with its five projects accounting for 1,559MW in 2022.

That something as basic as water is being mismanaged, and has been for decades, is shocking. This is especially so given that our taxes fund expert regulators to act on our behalf and oversee this resource, and the water companies that provide the services.When the head of the Environment Agency confessed that our resource management systems were more than 50 years old, it was like saying our businesses are still running on typewriters and carbon paper. It is made more depressing because I spent a career in the water sector, including decades in developing countries. Specialists in all these countries know there are cost-effective solutions, but the problem is rarely technical or financial.The problem is a political class that seems unable or unwilling to grapple with these issues and address them in any coherent manner. Bill KingdomOxford Your long read is a welcome wake-up call on the wastage of water. Yes, yet another one. I remember going to university in 1976 and being told to bring water carriers for use at the standpipes (in the event, they weren\u2019t needed).The article says regenerative agriculture has \u201cbegun to attract attention\u201d. That may be true, but it was a big feature of Cop15 in Paris, proposed by the French minister for agriculture; everyone said what a good idea it was, and then everyone ignored it.A lot of the pledges and a lot of the boasted improvements have no monitoring, no holding to account, and are therefore useless (think UK marine reserves continuing to be trawled).Duncan StephensonLeeds Thanet is more than twice as densely populated and with less rainfall than south-east England as a whole. Our water (93% of it) comes from the aquifer of chalk that comprises most of the Isle of Thanet. Yet Southern Water, the supplier, cannot predict how much water remains. We came close to drought last year and have recently had outages due to underinvestment.Global warming of glaciers is providing more water \u2013 and we are surrounded by it on two sides \u2013 but it is seawater. Your article did not mention desalination to solve the problem of drought. Nano-filtration of seawater is energy-expensive, but we have a potential power supply from tidal flow at the same location. Pumping desalinated water to a leaky lake at the highest point of the peninsula, conveniently situated on the disused airfield, would act as a reservoir and allow replenishment of the aquifer.Richard SymondsBroadstairs, Kent Tim Smedley\u2019s article on the risks of a lack of water conservation rang lots of bells.

It flushes our loos and feeds outside taps for watering the garden.At the time I tried to persuade the planning department of west Norfolk to introduce the concept as a pilot scheme.

It told us that, starting an hour later, at 2pm, we should use bottled water for drinking and cooking, out of an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d.I grabbed a bag and ran to Rite Aid, the nearest purveyor of bottled water. It was crammed and the atmosphere was very jolly. There was still plenty of water available and nobody was buying ridiculous amounts, so there was a general feeling of: \u201cHa ha, we\u2019re all going through dystopia together!\u201dAfter every single bottle of water in Philadelphia had been bought and panic had escalated, the city put out an update. The gist of it was: \u201cWhoops! Looks like you didn\u2019t need to buy all that bottled water after all, because the tap water is fine until 11.59pm on Monday.\u201d What might happen then? Good question. Presumably, tap-drinkers would turn into toxin-laced pumpkins.I say \u201cpresumably\u201d because details of what these chemicals might do to your innards is still scarce. City officials have said that \u201cpeople who ingest [contaminated] water will not suffer any near-term symptoms\u201d, which begs the question about long-term issues.Meanwhile, a Trinseo executive told local media that the chemicals his firm had spilled into the drinking-water supply were no big deal. \u201cIt\u2019s like the material you find in paint,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s your typical acrylic paint you have in your house; that\u2019s what, really, this material is, in a water base.\u201d This is not particularly reassuring, seeing as not many of us go around drinking paint. Maybe this is the sort of corporate statement you come up with when you work with toxic chemicals all day.The cherry on this dystopian cake? Not even the bottles of water that people were snapping up were guaranteed to be safe. Some Philadelphians discovered that the jugs of water they had bought because of the chemical spill were being recalled because they might be tainted by chemicals released by the recent train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.Accidents happen, of course. But there is a difference between an unavoidable accident and a series of public health disasters caused by corporate greed, deteriorating infrastructure and a lack of regulation. The US is the richest country in the world. Clean water shouldn\u2019t be a luxury \u2013 and, yet, that is increasingly what it is becoming.The most high-profile example of dirty water in the US was in Flint, Michigan, which had lead-poisoned tap water for years. But tap water across the US is laced with disturbing amounts of \u201cforever chemicals\u201d: a 2021 investigation by the Guardian and Consumer Reports found that millions of people across the country are exposed to potentially toxic chemicals in their drinking water \u2013 disproportionately people in poorer regions.It is starting to look like the water in Philadelphia will probably be OK. But this episode has served as a disturbing reminder that clean drinking water may not be something we can take for granted much longer. Investors already know this, of course. In 2021, the owner of one hedge fund called water in the US \u201ca trillion-dollar market opportunity\u201d. Meanwhile, other investors have been snapping up rights to the Colorado River.

It has been driven to the edge of extinction due to entanglement in fishing nets known as \u201cgillnets\u201d, which are now illegal in the area.The scientific committee of the IWC said in a statement it had grave concerns over the survival of the vaquita and had issued the alert to highlight the actions needed to save it. It said extinction of the porpoise was inevitable unless all gillnets were replaced with alternative fishing gear that protected it and the livelihoods of fishers.\u201cIf this doesn\u2019t happen now, it will be too late,\u201d it said.Dr Lindsay Porter, the vice-chair of the IWC\u2019s scientific committee said: \u201cWe wanted, with the extinction alert, to send the message to a wider audience and for everyone to understand how serious this is.\u201dThe porpoises, which measure about 1.2-1.5 metres, become entangled and die in gillnets, which are flat fishing nets suspended vertically in the water. These nets are used by poachers to hunt the totoaba, an endangered fish prized for its swim bladder in Chinese medicine and sold at vast profits on the black market in China and Hong Kong. During the rise in the totoaba trade, the vaquita\u2019s population has plummeted from 567 to 10 over the last decade.In 2022, the Mexican navy, in collaboration with government agencies, placed concrete blocks in an area known as the zero tolerance area, and increased enforcement to deter illegal gillnet fishing and protect the vaquita. There is some evidence illegal fishing has moved to the edge of the zone, creating new problem areas.The committee, made up of 200 leading scientists, said the effect of the deterrent structures looked promising but needed monitoring. The involvement of organised crime in the totoaba fishery and problems with enforcing fishing regulations at sea made it difficult to address, it said.On a more positive note, Porter said the species was not yet doomed, noting that at least one baby vaquita had been spotted in the last year, a sign that the individuals are healthy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Coca-Cola was found to be the UK\u2019s biggest polluter for the fourth year running, and responsible for almost a fifth (17%) of branded plastic pollution.This was despite the company having launched initiatives to reduce plastic pollution, such as the introduction of attached caps across its entire portfolio of brands in May 2022.McDonald\u2019s came second, accounting for 11% of polluting items identified, overtaking PepsiCo, which came third. Between them the three companies were responsible for 37% of all branded pollution, down two percentage points from last year\u2019s audit.Other top polluters include Tesco, Haribo, Nestl\u00e9, Heineken, Mars, Carlsberg and Red Bull.Izzy Ross, a campaign manager at Surfers Against Sewage, said the results were \u201cshocking, but sadly not surprising\u201d.She said: \u201cYear on year we\u2019re seeing the same culprits responsible for disgusting amounts of plastic pollution on our beaches, and in our cities and countryside. They must be held accountable for their pollution.\u201dSurfers Against Sewage is calling on companies to take responsibility for the entire life cycle of their products by reducing packaging and adopting circular business models.The charity is urging the government to introduce an \u201call-in\u201d deposit return scheme (DRS) for drinks of all sizes and materials. The government has announced plans to introduce a DRS that does not include glass in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but has since delayed implementation until 2025. A long-planned Scottish scheme has also been delayed until 2025.Ross said: \u201cDRS schemes have been shown to be highly successful in other countries, and there\u2019s no reason to assume this wouldn\u2019t be the case in the UK.\u201dA Coca-Cola spokesperson said: \u201cAt Coca-Cola we\u2019re continuing to work with our partners to encourage more recycling while actively supporting several initiatives aimed at making litter a thing of the past. Here in the UK, all of our bottles are already recyclable, and all of our smaller packs are made with 100% recycled plastic, excluding cap and label.\u201dA McDonald\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cOver 90% of our packaging comes from recycled or renewable sources, and can be recycled. We actively encourage our customers to dispose of our packaging responsibly.\u201dA PepsiCo UK spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise that litter on our beaches is a huge problem and we know there is a significant role we must play to help address this challenge.

I had the pleasure of meeting Caroline Lucas when I chaired an address she gave to the Quaker Socialist Society several years ago. One of the strongest elements of her political career is that she took up the tools and instruments that women and men fought for, even died for, over many years: the right to vote but also the right to be elected, and from this, the right to shape the laws and conduct of a country, and to bring about true equality and democracy through strong legislation.I understand why people choose to demonstrate, to form pressure groups, to campaign through social media. Yet, election to office is surely the wise way to change the world, with the tools bequeathed to us by the brave of the past. To abolish slavery, to gain votes for women, to outlaw racial prejudice or disrespect for homosexuality, the sure and final step is to legislate. As one who has modestly stood for and sometimes gained office, may I beg all those who seek to change life for the better to at least consider candidacy. It is your own personal and valuable bequest.Ian Flintoff Former parliamentary candidate and borough councillor, Oxford In October 2014, I wrote a letter to the Guardian saying that Caroline Lucas \u201cis widely regarded as the most effective opposition MP. For many of us, she is the real leader of the opposition.\u201d I became part of the \u201cGreen surge\u201d and was a parliamentary candidate for the Green party at the 2015 general election. Lucas is a refreshing change from most politicians, because she says what she means and means what she says.Neal Lawson is right that \u201cLucas embodied the fact that politicians and politics could be better\u201d. When we see a Labour party that refuses to debate the disaster that is Brexit, refuses to consider a fair electoral system, controls the selection of parliamentary candidates and won\u2019t allow its councillors to form pacts with other parties without central approval, the need for more politicians like Lucas is clear.She has shown that politicians of all parties on the centre-left can work together for the common good, and symbolises a progressive alliance that so many of us want.

        "text": "Six western states that rely on water from the Colorado River have agreed on a model to dramatically cut water use in the basin, months after the federal government called for action and an initial deadline passed.California \u2013 with the largest allocation of water from the river \u2013 is the lone holdout. Officials said the state would release its own plan.The Colorado River and its tributaries pass through seven states and into Mexico, serving 40 million people and a $5bn-a-year agricultural industry. Some of the largest cities in the country, including Los Angeles, Phoenix, Denver and Las Vegas, two Mexican states, Native American tribes and others depend on the river, which has been severely stressed by drought, demand and overuse.States missed a mid-August deadline to heed the US Bureau of Reclamation\u2019s call to propose ways to conserve 2m to 4m acre-feet of water. They regrouped to reach consensus by the end of January to fold into a larger proposal Reclamation has in the works.Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming sent a letter on Monday to Reclamation, which operates the major dams in the river system, to outline an alternative that builds on existing guidelines, deepens water cuts and factors in water that is lost through evaporation and transportation.Those states propose raising the levels where water reductions would be triggered at Lake Mead and Lake Powell, which are barometers of the river\u2019s health. The model creates more of a protective buffer for both reservoirs \u2013 the largest built in the US. It also seeks to fix water accounting and ensure that any water the Lower Basin states intentionally stored in Lake Mead is available for future use.The modeling would result in about 2m acre-feet of cuts in the Lower Basin, with smaller reductions in the Upper Basin. Mexico and California are factored into the equations, but neither signed on to Monday\u2019s letter.John Entsminger, general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, said all states have been negotiating in good faith. \u201cI don\u2019t view not having unanimity at one step in that process to be a failure,\u201d he said late on Monday. \u201cI think all seven states are still committed to working together.\u201dCalifornia released a proposal last October to cut 400,000 acre-feet. An acre-foot is enough water to supply two to three US households for a year.JB Hamby, chair of the Colorado River Board of California, said California will submit a model for water reductions in the basin that is practical, based on voluntary action and aligns with law governing the river and the hierarchy of water rights.\u201cCalifornia remains focused on practical solutions that can be implemented now to protect volumes of water in storage without driving conflict and litigation,\u201d he said in a statement o Monday.Nothing will happen immediately with the consensus reached among the six states. However, not reaching a consensus carried the risk of having the federal government alone determine how to eventually impose cuts.By not signing on, California does not avoid that risk.The US Bureau of Reclamation will consider the six states\u2019 agreement as part of a larger proposal to revise how it operates Glen Canyon and Hoover Dams \u2013 behemoth power producers on the Colorado River. The reservoirs behind the dams \u2013 Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u2013 have reached historic lows amid a more than two-decade-long drought and climate change.Without California\u2019s participation, the six states\u2019 proposal can only go so far to meet the hydrological realities of the river. Water managers in the Lower Basin say the scale of conservation Reclamation is seeking cannot be met without California, tribes and farmers who draw directly from the Colorado River.Also unclear is how much Mexico eventually will contribute to the savings. In the best water years, Mexico receives its full allocation of 1.5m acre-feet under a treaty reached with the US in 1944.",

The company denies liability. It is facing claims for compensation amounting to \u00a336bn in the world\u2019s largest group claim in English legal history.In November 2015, the Fund\u00e3o tailings dam, which BHP co-owned with the Brazilian iron ore producer Vale, burst. It unleashed 60m cubic metres of toxic waste, which obliterated land below and polluted everything in its path for more than 600km.The waste killed 19 people, buried villages, made thousands homeless and affected the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands more. The impact continues to wreak havoc on the ecosystem and environment, as well as on people\u2019s health.\u201cWe believe BHP is guilty of environmental racism,\u201d said the letter, delivered to 10 Downing Street on Thursday by some of those affected. \u201cIt is our Indigenous communities who have been most affected by the disaster; our communities who were most at risk from mining activities; and our communities that continue to be denied justice by BHP.\u201dA spokesman for BHP said the company \u201cstrongly refutes any accusations of environmental racism\u201d. In Brazil, BHP, along with Vale, and Samarco, the joint venture company responsible for managing the Fund\u00e3o dam, established the Renova Foundation to provide compensation for individuals and some businesses for loss and damages, as well as mitigating the disaster\u2019s environmental impacts. It has funded more than $6bn (\u00a34.58bn) of rehousing, rehabilitation and indemnification for all communities affected by the disaster, he added.The issue was discussed in British parliament last month. Tan Dhesi, the Labour MP for Slough, said: \u201cCompanies running large operations worldwide cannot be allowed to hide behind their subsidiaries when things go wrong or when there is an ecological and environmental disaster. The UK has an important global role.\u201dJim Shannon, a DUP MP, told those present: \u201cI cannot help but feel that if British or Australian communities had been impacted by such a disaster, they would not have been treated in the same way. Indeed, it would have been sorted a long time ago.\u201dVictims of Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disaster to get day in UK courtsRead moreThe letter asks the UK government to recognise its \u201cvital role in stopping such disasters ever happening again\u201d and to \u201ccrackdown on British companies that fail to live up to their social and environmental credentials at home and abroad\u201d.Tom Goodhead, the global managing partner and chief executive of Pogust Goodhead, the London-based international law firm representing the victims, said: \u201cThis is not about money for most of these people \u2013 they want justice.\u201dMeanwhile, BHP and Vale are embroiled in a legal battle over which has legal and financial responsibility for the disaster.

Now research suggests that today\u2019s home run hitters are seeing their shots turbocharged by the climate crisis.A study by researchers at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire used data from 100,000 Major League Baseball games and 220,000 individually hit balls to show that higher temperatures increase the number of balls hit out of the park.They found that between 2010 and 2019, global heating led on average to an extra 58 home runs a year. Since 6,776 home runs were hit in the record-setting 2019 season, the effect is modest. But each degree Celsius of future warming is associated with about 95 more home runs a season, they said. If the climate crisis was not mitigated, rising temperatures could be responsible for a 10% increase by the end of the century.\u201cWhen you have warmer temperatures you have lower air density, and when you have lower air density you have less drag on a flying object, whether that\u2019s a baseball or an aeroplane,\u201d said Justin Mankin, an assistant professor of geography at Dartmouth and senior author of the study published by the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. \u201cOn a warm day as opposed to a cool day you should expect more home runs.\u201dThe authors accounted for a number of other influences, including covered stadiums, manufacturing variabilities in bats and balls, use of performance-enhancing drugs and the effect of modern sports analytics. They found the biggest home run surge was liable to take place at Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, because it hosts a large number of daytime games, meaning hotter temperatures than at night.Though the Texas Rangers\u2019 previous ballpark opened as recently as 1994, the summer heat in the Dallas region proved so uncomfortable that the club moved to a climate-controlled $1.2bn new stadium with a retractable roof in 2020. Among the league\u2019s 30 stadiums, eight have retractable or fixed roofs.\u201cMore roofs on ballparks is going to be unavoidable. That is frustrating,\u201d said Christopher Callahan, the lead author of the study. \u201cOne of the joys of baseball is sitting in the open air, sitting under the blue sky and the breeze.\u201d However, he added: \u201cAt a certain point over the course of the next couple of decades it\u2019s going to be unsafe to play baseball games in very high temperatures.\u201dAs well as the effect of heat on players, staff and fans, American stadiums near water, including venues in Florida, California and New York, are vulnerable to risks such as rising sea levels and more intense hurricanes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "National and regional museums across the UK have agreed to take collective action on the climate crisis, including managing collections more sustainably and using their position to engage audiences with the issues.Representatives of museums, organisations in the sector and funders took part in the first UK Museum Cop at Tate Modern in London last week. Among those attending were museums and organisations from Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol, Brighton, Leeds, Derby, Liverpool, York, Sheffield and London, as well as national bodies from England, Wales and Scotland.Leading museums and galleries, including Tate, have ended sponsorship deals with fossil fuel companies over recent years under pressure from environment campaigners. The British Museum, which did not take part in the Museum Cop, announced this year it had ended its sponsorship deal with BP after 27 years.In a statement described as a \u201cfirst ever joint commitment for collective action\u201d, museum leaders said they felt a \u201cresponsibility to speak out about the climate and biodiversity crisis\u201d.Museums are \u201cinstitutions with a long-term view. Many have collections relating to the Earth\u2019s five previous mass extinction events, and we are now in the midst of the sixth, the Anthropocene. UK museum leaders feel they have an ethical obligation to take action to alleviate that damage,\u201d the statement said.They pledged to use their \u201ccollections, programmes and exhibitions to engage audiences with the climate crisis and inspire them to take positive action\u201d; to manage collections sustainably; to develop and implement decarbonisation plans; and to increase biodiversity in museums\u2019 green spaces.Maria Balshaw, the chair of the National Museum Directors\u2019 Council, which organised the Cop, and the director of Tate, said: \u201cMuseums and galleries have a unique perspective as institutions that have to take a long-term view with their mission to preserve collections and stories for the long future.\u201cThe conference agreed a series of vital actions to reduce the environmental impact of museums and show how they can inspire positive action for our public.\u201dNick Merriman, chief executive of the Horniman Museum and Gardens in south London and chair of the Cop, said: \u201cMuseums have a special place in the debate about the climate and biodiversity crisis because they can take a long-term view, beyond the short-term cycles of politics and economics.\u201cThe fact that the whole museum sector has come together to stress the urgency for action is hugely significant. We will now work together to implement the actions we have agreed.\u201dThe conference called on UK politicians and businesses to accelerate action on climate change \u201cbefore it is too late\u201d.It recommended urgent changes to planning laws and increased investment to ensure the sustainability of heritage buildings, and for all museums to adopt a \u201cgreener option first\u201d principle in all areas of practice.Environmental sustainability should be included in training and apprenticeships in the sector, the conference said.",

        "text": "Only 22% of people trust Rishi Sunak to tackle the climate crisis after his announcement that he will weaken the UK\u2019s net zero policies.An exclusive poll for the Guardian found that fewer than a quarter of people trust the prime minister to take on the challenge. A total of 53% said they did not trust him, while 19% said they did not know.The polling company WeThink also asked respondents whether they thought forcing landlords to insulate their homes would benefit them, and 55% said it would. Sunak has dumped plans to fine landlords who do not update their homes to acceptable energy efficiency standards.The Guardian poll questioned 1,313 people on 21 September and is weighted to a nationally representative population. WeThink is a member of the British Polling Council.This week, in one of his biggest policy changes since taking office, Sunak confirmed the UK would push back the deadline for selling new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing-out of gas boilers, prompting furious condemnation from the automobile and energy industries, as well as some Conservatives including Boris Johnson and the former environment minister Zac Goldsmith.Though Sunak claims that his changes will save consumers money, this has been disputed by many experts. For instance, private renters will pay \u00a31bn a year more in energy bills because of the scrapping of proposals to make landlords upgrade insulation on their properties, according to the Social Market Foundation.Pushing back the deadline for phasing-out sales of new petrol and diesel cars would also cost consumers money, as electric vehicles save drivers \u00a35,000 to \u00a38,000 in fuel costs over their lifetime, the thinktank said.The Conservatives risk losing seats in the \u201cblue wall\u201d of affluent, pro-remain Tory constituencies in southern England because of net zero decisions made this week, polling commissioned by Greenpeace has suggested. Concerns over climate and nature are higher than the national average in the blue wall and scores of marginal seats, the survey of 20,000 people showed.The detailed, constituency-level polling of people across Great Britain by Survation, which factors in the new boundaries for the next general election, found that of those who had an opinion, 70% stated that climate and environment policies were important and would influence how they would vote in the next election.The results are higher in the blue wall, where the Conservatives are predicted to hold only 29 out of 52 seats, and in the most marginal constituencies, with overwhelming support for almost all specific climate policies and almost three in four blue wall and marginal constituents (72% and 71% respectively) stating that those policies would influence how they would vote.In blue wall and marginal battlegrounds, more than four in five (85% in the blue wall, 86% in the most marginal seats) of constituents who had an opinion wanted the government to provide more financial support to insulate homes, and almost four in five (73% for both) wanted more government funding for heat pumps. They also wanted to see more government investment for renewable power (88% and 87%) and subsidised rail travel to ensure it was always cheaper than driving (79% for both).skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Dozens of road building projects across Wales have been halted or amended as part of a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d policy that reassessed more than 50 schemes against a series of tough tests on their impact on the climate emergency.Only 15 of the projects reviewed by an expert roads review panel will go ahead in their original form, with others scaled back, postponed or in some cases shelved.Lee Waters, the deputy climate change minister in the Labour-led Welsh government, described the decisions as \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d and green campaigners characterised the administration\u2019s approach as \u201cworld-leading\u201d.Waters accepted the policy would attract criticism from some. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to make decisions with short-term pain for long-term gain,\u201d he said. However, he insisted a \u201cllwybr newydd\u201d (new path) was needed.\u201cWe will not get to net zero unless we stop doing the same thing over and over,\u201d he said.Among the projects halted are a third Menai Bridge linking Anglesey and the mainland while a controversial \u201cred route\u201d scheme in Flintshire, north Wales, a major new road that threatened ancient woodland and wildflower meadows, will not go ahead as planned.Changes to the A483 around Wrexham will also be scrapped and a review will be set up to consider an \u201cexemplar\u201d project to reduce car usage.Waters said: \u201cWe will still invest in roads. We are building new roads but we are raising the bar for where new roads are the right response to transport problems. We are also investing in real alternatives, including investment in rail, bus, walking and cycling projects.\u201cOur approach for the last 70 years is not working. The bypass that was demanded to relieve congestion often ends up leading to extra traffic, which in time brings further demands for extra lanes, wider junctions and more roads.\u201cRound and round we go, emitting more and more carbon as we do it, and we will not get to net zero unless we stop doing the same thing over and over.\u201dThe roads review was announced in June 2021, freezing all road-building projects. An independent panel was then created and tasked with reviewing the projects considered part of the review.Waters added that, in any case, the Welsh government did not have the budget to build all the roads that were planned because its capital budget was being reduced by the UK government. \u201cWith fewer resources it becomes even more important to prioritise,\u201d he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It\u2019s in our skies, our water, and our land \u2013 with record-shattering heat waves, increasingly severe wildfires and flooding from superstorms and rising seas.We have no time for delays. Tackling this crisis and protecting frontline environmental justice communities will take all of us. And the tax-dodging ultra-wealthy need to stop fueling the problem and start supporting first-class solutions.We warned you about this climate emergency. Now it\u2019s here | Peter KalmusRead moreThat\u2019s why, this July, I introduced the Fueling Alternative Transportation with a Carbon Aviation Tax (Fatcat) Act with Congresswoman Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez.Private air travel is the most energy-intensive form of transportation. For each passenger, private jets pollute as much as 14 times more than commercial flights and 50 times more than trains. Despite their sky-high emissions, private air travel is taxed considerably less than commercial air travel.My legislation changes that. Because the 1% should not get a free ride while destroying our environment.At the moment, billionaires and the ultra-wealthy are getting a bargain, paying less in taxes each year to fly private and contribute more pollution than millions of drivers combined on the roads below. Just one hour of flying private negates the climate benefits of driving an electric car for an entire year. That is unfair and it is unacceptable.For the sake of our environment, it is time to ground these fat cats and make them pay their fair share, so that we can invest in building the energy-efficient and clean public transportation that our economy and communities across the country desperately need. We cannot continue to ask frontline communities \u2013 disproportionately low-income, rural, immigrant, Black and brown Americans who are bearing the weight of the climate crisis \u2013 to subsidize billionaires jet-setting the globe.Our legislation would increase fuel taxes for private jet travel from the current $0.22 to nearly $2 a gallon \u2013 the equivalent of an estimated $200 a metric ton of a private jet\u2019s CO2 emissions \u2013 and remove existing fuel tax exemptions for private flight activities that worsen the climate crisis, like oil or gas exploration.The revenue generated by the Fatcat Act would be transferred to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund and a newly created federal Clean Communities Trust Fund to support air monitoring for environmental justice communities and long-term investments in clean, affordable public transportation across the country \u2013 including passenger rail and bus routes near commercial airports.To fully tackle the climate crisis at the scale that is required, we need to ensure that those who are fueling this problem are held accountable for contributing to the solution. It is, of course, the same logic that should, but sadly does not, apply to our tax code.If Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and countless Wall Street hedge fund managers want to fly private jets, the least they can do is pay their fair share in taxes to compensate for the damage to our environment and the wear on our infrastructure. It\u2019s unconscionable that they be allowed to continue to pay pennies on the dollar to pollute our environment as Americans suffer through the hottest days in an estimated 125,000 years. Everyday Americans should not have to pay for their excess.And let\u2019s be clear: this is an issue of economic and environmental justice. The wealthiest 1% globally are responsible for more than twice as much carbon dioxide pollution as the bottom 50%. But the burden of that pollution gets passed along to people already struggling.A billionaire who takes to the skies in a private jet isn\u2019t going to feel the hardship of paying a sky-high air conditioning or electric bill. The ultra-wealthy who own their own airplanes aren\u2019t going to feel the hardship of breathing dirty air.We are approaching a dangerous tipping point in our battle against the climate crisis. This summer\u2019s brutal weather is just a preview of what is to come. We all need to step up to do our part to address this crisis. Especially jet-setting billionaires.\nEdward J Markey is a US senator from Massachusetts\n",

The agriculture ministry has now banned the use of water for irrigation, watering green spaces and other public areas, and for washing cars.\u201cI\u2019ve been experiencing water cuts overnight for the last two or three weeks,\u201d said Haythem Hazel, an English teacher in the capital, Tunis. \u201cIt\u2019s alarming. It shows we really have a water crisis in Tunisia. It\u2019s difficult to stay without water for even two hours.\u201d.Reservoirs across the country are said to be about 30% short of capacity. Levels at the Sidi Salem reservoir, which serves the north of the country, including Tunis, are only about 16% full.Tunisia has always relied heavily on capturing surface water for its supplies, leaving it especially vulnerable to shortages of rainfall driven by the climate crisis. In the past four years, the Mediterranean region has had blistering summers, mild winters and relatively little rain.It is estimated that temperatures across Tunisia will increase by up to 3.8C (6.8F) by 2050, while rainfall will decrease by at least 4% over the same period.A network of ageing pipes is making the problem worse. According to project workers from the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) in Tunis, leaks account for the loss of about 30% of the country\u2019s water before it reaches a tap.\u201cMuch of the infrastructure is very old, dating back to the 1950s,\u201d said Imen Rais, WWF\u2019s freshwater programme manager, \u201cand it hasn\u2019t really been maintained since the [2011] revolution.\u201dPoor enforcement of planning regulations since the revolution has also affected both availability of water and quality. Unsanctioned housing and lack of infrastructure in poorer districts has led to the siphoning of groundwater through illegally dug wells and wastewater flowing directly into the water supply.\u201cThis is as bad as we\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Jamel Jrijer, director for WWF North Africa. \u201cThis was predicted as far back as the 1970s but we\u2019ve never really seen any action. Matters deteriorated after the revolution, where successive governments promised everything but did nothing.\u201dWhile water shortages will directly affect householders, the water ban for farmers, who account for about 75% of Tunisia\u2019s water consumption, will be especially significant.The drought will prove \u201cdisastrous\u201d, a farmers union official, Mohamed Rjaibia, told Reuters last week, when rationing was announced. This year\u2019s grain crop is already predicted to be only a third of last year\u2019s, at 200,000-250,000 tonnes compared with 750,000 tonnes in 2022. The agriculture sector contributes about 10% of the country\u2019s annual GDP.Why is Tunisia in crisis and why do sub-Saharan people want to leave?Read moreThe government is considering digging wells, desalinating seawater and recycling wastewater, but there is little chance of escaping the worst of the crisis before the summer.Tunisia is already reeling from a weak economy, high unemployment and rising living costs, and there are fears the water cuts could further stoke social unrest. In February, demonstrators took to the streets after President Kais Saied accused undocumented migrants of a plot to dilute Tunisia\u2019s Arab identity. The comments were widely viewed as an attempt by Saied to distract attention from the country\u2019s economic woes.The government is still negotiating a bailout plan with the International Monetary Fund, which is understood to include curtailing the country\u2019s entrenched subsidy system, which manages the prices of household staples, such as coffee, bread and grains.",

Virtual adoption comes with live updates on your axolotl\u2019s health. For less money, donors can buy a virtual dinner for one of the creatures, which are relatively popular pets in the US.In Mexican axolotls\u2019 main habitat, the population density has plummeted 99.5% in under two decades, according to scientists behind the fundraiser.\u2018They\u2019re inherently charismatic\u2019: the amateur sleuths hooked on sea slugsRead moreLast year\u2019s Adoptaxolotl campaign raised just more than 450,000 pesos ($26,300) towards an experimental captive-breeding program and efforts to restore habitat in the ancient Aztec canals of Xochimilco, a southern borough of Mexico City.Still, there are not enough resources for thorough research, said Alejandro Calzada, an ecologist surveying less well-known species of axolotls for the government\u2019s environment department.\u201cWe lack big monitoring of all the streams in Mexico City,\u201d let alone the whole country, said Calzada, who leads a team of nine researchers. \u201cFor this large area it is not enough.\u201dA worker shows an axolotl in a hatchery in Mexico City, Mexico, on 19 August 2019.

A more recent international study found less than 1,000 Mexican axolotls left in the wild.Luis Zambrano Gonz\u00e1lez, one of the university\u2019s scientists announcing the fundraiser, told the Associated Press he hopes to begin a new census (the first since 2014) in March.\u201cThere is no more time for Xochimilco,\u201d said Zambrano. \u201cThe invasion\u201d of pollution is very strong: soccer fields, floating dens. It is very sad.\u201dWithout data on the number and distribution of different axolotl species in Mexico, it is hard to know how long the creatures have left, and where to prioritize what resources are available.\u201cWhat I know is that we have to work urgently,\u201d Calzada said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scientists in labs around the world think this healing power could hold the secret to tissue repair and even cancer recovery.In the past, government conservation programs have largely focused on the most popular species: the Mexican axolotl, found in Xochimilco. But other species can be found across the country, from tiny streams in the valley of Mexico to the northern Sonora desert.Mexico City\u2019s expanding urbanization has damaged the water quality of the canals, while in lakes around the capital rainbow trout, which escape from farms, can displace axolotls and eat their food.Calzada said his team was increasingly finding axolotls dead from chytrid fungus, a skin-eating disease causing catastrophic amphibian die-offs from Europe to Australia.While academics rely on donations, and Calzada\u2019s team turns to a corps of volunteers, the Mexican government recently approved an 11% funding cut for its environment department.Over its six-year term, the administration of president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador will have given 35% less money to the country\u2019s environment department than its predecessor, according to an analysis of Mexico\u2019s 2024 budget.",

We need National Grid to be able to focus solely on ensuring we have a sustainable future, not being distracted by keeping shareholders sweet.\u201dUnite\u2019s general secretary, Sharon Graham, said National Grid and the 14 DNOs moved slowly to protect shareholder interests. \u201cElectricity and gas networks such as National Grid are effectively state-licensed cash machines.\u201dShe said the union\u2019s research showed that the transmission and distribution monopolies made a combined \u00a36.3bn in 2021, up from \u00a35.6bn in 2019. \u201cUnite\u2019s analysis found that at least 30% of the increase in the energy price cap over the last year was made up of profit for companies across the energy supply chain, with networks like National Grid among the biggest winners.\u201dThe Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing\u2019s CK Group was awarded \u00a32bn in dividends over the last 5 years from its holdings in the DNO\u2019s UK Power Networks, Northern Gas Networks, Wales and West Utilities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The regulator will also allow most of this cost of new infrastructure investments to be passed on to customers, allowing shareholders to preserve their annual dividends.",

        "text": "A type of zooplankton found in marine and fresh water can ingest and break down microplastics, scientists have discovered. But rather than providing a solution to the threat plastics pose to aquatic life, the tiny creatures known as rotifers could be accelerating the risk by splitting the particles into thousands of smaller and potentially more dangerous nanoplastics.Each rotifer, named from the Latin for \u201cwheel-bearer\u201d owing to the whirling wheel of cilia around their mouths, can create between 348,000 and 366,000 nanoplastics \u2013 particles smaller than one micrometre \u2013 each day.The animals are microscopic, ubiquitous and abundant, with up to 23,000 individuals found living in one litre of water, in one location. The researchers, from a team led by the University of Massachusetts Amherst, calculated that in Poyang Lake, the largest lake in China, rotifers were creating 13.3 quadrillion of these plastic particles every day.Plastic can take up to 500 years to decompose. As it ages, tiny pieces break off. Physical and chemical processes are known to break them down, including when exposed to sunlight or when waves grind bits of plastic against rocks, beaches or other obstacles floating in the ocean.The scientists sought to examine what role aquatic life might play in microplastic creation, especially after the discovery in 2018 that Antarctic krill are able to break down polyethylene balls into fragments of less than one micrometre. Baoshan Xing, a professor of environmental and soil chemistry at the University of Massachusetts Amherst\u2019s Stockbridge School of Agriculture, said they decided to look at rotifers because they had specialised chewing apparatus similar to krill. They wanted to test the hypothesis that rotifers, of which there are 2,000 species worldwide, could also break down plastic.\u201cWhereas Antarctic krill live in a place that is essentially unpopulated, we chose rotifers in part because they occur throughout the world\u2019s temperate and tropical zones, where people live,\u201d said Xing, the paper\u2019s senior author.The animals mistake microplastics \u2013 fragments of less than 5mm in diameter \u2013 for algae, he said.After exposing marine and freshwater species of rotifers to a variety of different plastics of different sizes, they found all could ingest microplastics of up to 10 micrometres (0.01mm), break them down and then excrete thousands of nanoplastics back into the environment. Polyethylene microplastics from food containers as well as nanoplastics were detected in the rotifers\u2019 bodies.Xing said their work was \u201cjust the first step\u201d. \u201cWe need the scientific community to determine how harmful these nanoplastics are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to look at other organisms on land and in water for biological fragmentation of microplastics and collaborate with toxicologists and public health researchers to determine what this plague of nanoplastics is doing to us.\u201dStudies have shown that nanoplastics are probably more dangerous for living organisms than microplastics because they are more abundant and reactive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Each microplastic could theoretically be broken down into 1,000,000,000,000,000 nanoplastic particles, which are then more easily spread.Microplastics have contaminated every corner of the planet, from the top of Mount Everest to the depths of the Mariana Trench, and research has shown they are in many humans\u2019 blood and heart tissue and the placentas of unborn babies. They cause harm in human cells in the laboratory at levels known to be eaten by people via food.Jian Zhao, a professor of environmental science and engineering at the Ocean University of China and the paper\u2019s lead author, said nanoplastics were not only potentially toxic to various organisms but served as carriers for other contaminants. The release of chemical additives in the plastic could be enhanced during and after fragmentation, he added.",

        "text": "Carbon emissions from the global electricity sector may peak this year, after plateauing in the first half of 2023, because of a surge in wind and solar power, according to a climate thinktank.A new report on global electricity generation found that the growth of renewables was so rapid that it was close to the incredibly fast rate required if the world is to hit the tripling of capacity by the end of the decade that experts believe is necessary to stay on the 1.5C pathway.It also noted that there had been only a slight increase in emissions in the first six months of the year, compared with the same period a year before.The findings suggest the world may be close to reaching the peak of the global power sector\u2019s carbon emissions, and they could soon even begin to fall in line with global climate targets.The report, by the climate thinktank Ember, compared electricity data from January to June 2023 to the same period last year, across 78 countries representing 92% of the world\u2019s electricity demand.Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, Ember\u2019s senior electricity analyst and the lead author of the report, said: \u201cIt\u2019s still hanging in the balance if 2023 will see a fall in power-sector emissions.\u201d\u2018Staggering\u2019 green growth gives hope for 1.5C, says global energy chiefRead more\u201cThe world is teetering at the peak of power-sector emissions, and we now need to unleash the momentum for a rapid decline in fossil fuels by securing a global agreement to triple renewables capacity this decade,\u201d she said.The report found that global power-sector emissions rose by 0.2% in the first half of the year compared with the same period last year.However, it also found that wind and solar power had climbed to a combined total of 14.3% of the world\u2019s electricity, up from 12.8% last year.Solar power in particular grew by 16% in the first half of the year, compared with the first six months of 2022, after 50 countries set new monthly records for solar generation, according to Ember.Wiatros-Motyka told the Guardian that tripling the world\u2019s renewable energy capacity was the \u201csingle biggest action that governments can take to put the world on a course for a 1.5C-aligned pathway\u201d.Carbon emissions from generating electricity need to fall to net zero by 2045 globally, and by 2035 in advanced economies, in order to reach the Paris agreement\u2019s goal of limiting the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, according to modelling by the International Energy Agency (IEA).The IEA\u2019s influential net zero roadmap suggests that the combined share of solar and wind power would need to increase from 12% last year to 40% in 2030 to remain on track.To achieve that, global renewable capacity would have to triple by the end of the decade, which would require solar power to grow by 26% every year, while wind power would need to grow by 16% a year.\u201cTo put this in context, last year\u2019s year-on-year growth was 25% for solar and 14% for wind, so almost exactly what is needed,\u201d said Wiatros-Motyka. \u201cRapid growth in solar and wind has so far kept pace with pathways aligned with 1.5C. But to keep up these high growth rates throughout this decade, countries need to deploy bigger and faster.\u201dFossil fuels were also kept at bay by a global slowdown in the world\u2019s growing demand for electricity, according to the report. It found that global electricity demand rose by 0.4% in the first half of 2023 compared with the same period last year, well below the 10-year average of 2.6% before that.",

The group says the phenomenon was filmed at a section of river more than 1km from where similar bubbles have been observed since 2012, prompting a decade of scientific investigation.A viral 2016 video showed the river \u2013 which is in the headwaters of the Murray-Darling system \u2013 being set on fire with a barbecue lighter.It is understood the site shown in the new footage is extremely difficult to access. The existence of gas bubbles at the location was not previously publicly known, including among some local farmers and anti-fracking activists who claim video of the gas seep is \u201cdisturbing\u201d and amounts to evidence that the issue is intensifying and spreading.Origin Energy, the operator of the Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) joint venture, said in a statement that the location shown in the video was a \u201cknown seep since 2015\u201d and the company had monitored it since.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nOrigin said it had \u201cengaged locally with landowners and stakeholders\u201d, but does not appear to have made any public disclosure about a significant seep at the location.Scientific studies, including by the CSIRO, have found that bubbles on the Condamine are naturally occurring and unlikely the direct result of fracking, but that CSG production might affect the intensity of the phenomenon.Queensland government faulted for slow response to gas seep and calling Knitting Nannas a \u2018risk\u2019Read moreA 2021 report commissioned by the Queensland Department of Environment and Science said gas escape may have been \u201cenhanced\u201d by CSG production about 1km away.The same study also cited reports by APLNG, which says mitigation measures are \u201cworking\u201d and have had \u201ca positive impact in significantly reducing the seeps\u201d.Dayne Pratzky, who first raised alarm about gas seeps in the Condamine a decade ago, said he was concerned that more had likely occurred in other places across the Darling Downs, a region in which the gas industry has drilled thousands of wells and continues to expand.\u201cNew areas of the river are now bubbling like a boiling broth, much closer to the Chinchilla Weir than impacted areas of the river first identified about a decade ago,\u201d Pratzky said.\u201cWhat\u2019s really concerning is the seeps that we can\u2019t see. We only know about the Condamine River seeps because the bubbles are visible in water. I\u2019d bet my hat on there being much more intense seeps all across the gasfields.\u201dEllie Smith, the Queensland coordinator of Lock the Gate, said the discovery showed the true extent of fugitive emissions from gasfields was not properly understood. She said this had \u201cmajor implications\u201d for the recent safeguard mechanism deal.\u201cThe safeguard mechanism will require emitters to reduce their net direct emissions year on year,\u201d Smith said.\u201cBut this will be extremely difficult to monitor and enforce when gas activity is increasing the rate of methane coming out of the ground in areas beyond the immediate gasfield.\u201dRiver on fire in Greens MP\u2019s video is natural, not fracking, says CSIRORead moreAPLNG says on its website that it has successfully mitigated the gas seeps by building production wells to extract shallow gas migrating toward natural geological faults.The company says it has a \u201crobust, ongoing program of research into the seeps\u201d, including monitoring bores and other studies. It says gas flow measurements at the main seep site have reduced significantly over time.In a statement in response to the new video, Origin said it has continued to monitor known seeps locations. The company said it had \u201crecently brought online several intercept wells and related infrastructure that were offline for a period\u201d.\u201cOur experience indicates seep volumes typically decline over time as these wells come online,\u201d the Origin statement says.\u201cPrevious reports and studies by independent agencies have also identified no gas safety risk nor environmental harm.\u201d",

Alarms signalling spills at treatment works were not acted upon for several hours at two sites, the investigation found.District Judge Matson, sitting at Plymouth magistrates court on Wednesday, sentenced the company on 13 charges \u2013 six for illegal water discharge activities and seven for contravening environmental permit conditions.Matson said \u201cincidents of pollution will no longer be tolerated by these courts\u201d and fined South West Water \u00a32.15m. The company, which had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing, was also ordered to pay costs of \u00a3280,000 and a \u00a3170 victim surcharge.The EA said chemicals were discharged from the treatment works sites \u201con more than one occasion\u201d, causing significant environmental damage to sites at Kilmington, on the River Axe, and Crediton, on the River Creedy.Thousands of fish died in the Axe after the discharge, including some protected species, the agency said.South West Water breached permit rules in Lostwithiel in July 2016 by pumping raw sewage into the River Fowey. Control room alarms showed there was something wrong with the works but the discharge continued for more than 12 hours.Alarms also went off at at Watergate Bay treatment works in August 2016 but no action was taken and sewage was illegally discharged into the coastal waters for more than 35 hours. E coli levels were found to be 2,000 times higher than the level at which water quality would be classified as poor.On two occasions, effluent from the Torpoint sewage treatment works was pumped into a site of special scientific interest at St John\u2019s Lake and into part of a special area of conservation (SAC), both designated as such for their variety of bird life and invertebrates.Clarissa Newell, of the EA, said failure to apply basic environmental management principles caused pollution incidents at some of the most scenic locations in Devon and Cornwall, including bathing waters and SACs.\u201cHaving alarms to alert you that sewage is spilling is no good if no action is taken,\u201d she said. \u201cEnforcement is intended to prevent these things from happening again, and ensure South West Water improves and meets the expectations placed on it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

On Thursday, dozens of people flocked to Battersea park to take pictures under the blooming row of cherry blossom trees.The National Trust has vowed to plant 4m blossoming trees across England, Wales and Northern Ireland by 2030 as part of its wider tree-planting mission, as well as its Blossom Watch campaign, which encourages people to embrace the fleeting beauty of the trees each year.\u201cWe\u2019ve taken inspiration from the hanami festivals in Japan where there are blossom trees on a huge scale. Certainly, we\u2019ve experienced lots of tourists coming to take photos of the blossoms and share them,\u201d said Tom Grosvenor, a senior project manager for the National Trust in Birmingham.Japanese snack company Sakuraco recently posted a list of the best UK cherry blossom spots for its customers, including a number of London parks and National Trust sites, if they want to experience sakura (cherry blossom) abroad.\u201cThe original idea started during the first lockdown, which just so happened to coincide with blossom season. There was such an appetite for it so the programme celebrating blossom has gone from strength to strength and has become almost like a festival,\u201d Grosvenor added.He is leading the Birmingham Blossom programme, which saw 600 blossom trees planted along the city\u2019s number 11 bus route in January to create a \u201cring of blossom\u201d around the city, with many already in bloom.The project is a reference to Birmingham\u2019s botanical history when it was once known as a \u201ctown ringed by blossom\u201d due to being surrounded by gardens and orchards in the mid-18th century.\u201cWe offered out blossom trees to anyone who wanted one who lived within a 25 minute walk of that bus route, so that could be residents, schools, community groups. We had a really good response,\u201d Grosvenor said.People relaxing under a cherry blossom tree in St James\u2019s Park, 4 April 2023.

        "text": "Delays to the government\u2019s planned consultation on net zero regulations for housebuilding will mean more households being hit with hefty bills for energy, housing experts have said.The future homes standard (FHS), which will stipulate that housebuilders construct new homes to be low carbon, was supposed to be opened for consultation in March, but that slipped to a promise of publication in the summer.At the Tory party conference this week Martin Callanan, the minister for energy efficiency and green finance, told a private gathering that the consultation would not be out until next year.This was later clarified to promise an opening of the consultation by the end of this year. Lord Callanan tweeted: \u201cThe government will publish the consultation on the future homes standard for new homes this year. We will implement the FHS in 2025, ensuring new homes are ready for net zero.\u201dThe delay would cause further problems for homeowners, said Juliet Phillips, senior policy adviser at the thinktank E3G.\u201cThe standard is an essential tool for ensuring all new homes are warm, healthy and highly efficient. Delay to the consultation, which was originally due this spring, had led to concern that the standard had been kicked into the long grass. As a vital policy for ensuring all new homes are green and cheap to run, any further delay to the standard would be costly for homeowners \u2013 and the planet.\u201dLouise Hutchins, head of policy at the UK Green Building Council, added: \u201cThe best developers have spent years and millions gearing up for modern green building standards. This continued delay and uncertainty on new higher standards only benefits those who took a punt that the government would drag its feet on tackling the climate emergency.\u201dAn investigation by the Guardian this week found that housebuilders had benefited by at least \u00a315bn over the last eight years by not having to construct homes to low-carbon standards.Installing heat pumps, solar panels and high-grade insulation on homes while building them is much less expensive than retrofitting them later. But if homes are built to these standards, the costs, which were roughly \u00a35,000 a house before the Covid-19 pandemic and are now about \u00a38,000 a house, are borne by the housebuilder.About 1.5m homes are estimated to have been built without these low-carbon fittings since 2015, when the Conservative government scrapped the zero carbon homes standard. Abandoning the standard has saved housebuilders \u00a315bn by the most conservative estimate.The cost of retrofitting these homes is likely to reach \u00a330bn to \u00a345bn, and will fall on homeowners or taxpayers.Housebuilders and property developers are among the biggest donors to the Tory party. The same Guardian investigation also found that at least 10% of donations to the party since 2010 had come from the sector.Opposition parties called the findings a scandal. Helen Morgan, communities and local government spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said: \u201cThe Conservatives have proven time and again that they cannot be trusted with protecting our environment.\u201cThey have bent over backwards for their developer donors and delayed vital measures to cut bills. All these delays will ensure are higher energy bills for years to come and yet more families having to choose between heating and eating.\u201dCaroline Lucas, the Green party MP, said: \u201cJust as the government slashes vital environmental regulations and kicks low-carbon building measures into the long grass, tens of millions of pounds find their way into Tory coffers. This vicious cycle will destroy nature and frustrate progress on the climate emergency when it\u2019s needed more than ever.\u201dShe added: \u201cWe know every home has the potential to be its own power station \u2013 with mandatory solar panels on all suitable new roofs, insulation and energy efficiency measures providing people with warm homes and cheap energy bills. If the government won\u2019t enforce those regulations, it should make way for one which will.\u201dHutchins said that seeking further delays to the future homes standard could backfire on the housing industry.\u201cThose who have been secretly lobbying the government behind the scenes for delays, or even scrapping a move to better standards, risk turning public opinion against the industry as the water companies have done so spectacularly,\u201d she said.Phillips, of E3G, called for the new future homes standard to come as soon as possible. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had to wait a decade for the government to bring forward a new standard to ensure new buildings are fit for the future. Any further delay would be unacceptable,\u201d she said.The Labour party did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment.",

The aim is to make people think about how they buy and look after clothing in this fast-fashion, throwaway world.\u201cRecycling and reusing clothing has been commonplace throughout history,\u201d said Shelley Tobin, the costume curator at Killerton. \u201cThis exhibition asks the question: can we learn lessons from these past practices and reapply forgotten skills to look after our clothes and make them more sustainable?\u201cThe items exhibited show that we only need look to history to discover ways to ensure that the clothing we buy, make and wear is durable, ethical and avoids waste.\u201dThe exhibition begins with T-shirts emblazoned with sobering facts about clothes waste. They say 300,000 tonnes of clothing is put into landfill every year in the UK and it takes 3,781 litres water to make one pair of jeans.In contrast, the highlight of the first room is a sleeved waistcoat made of silk in about 1690. It was handed down through the generations and at one point the horizontal pocket flaps were replaced with more fashionable vertical ones. In the early 20th century it was turned into a fancy dress costume and in the 1980s someone conserved it by relining it.A woman\u2019s dressing gown made after the second world war from a surplus army blanket and repurposed green woollen cloth. Photograph: Steve Haywood/National TrustTobin said some modern makers were reusing clothes and fabric. So in the same cabinet as the waistcoat is a much more modern piece, a suit made in 2022 out of old denim jeans by the London fashion company ELV Denim.Another highlight is a \u201ctransformation dress\u201d made in 1870 and consisting of a billowing skirt that could be matched with a modest long-sleeved, high-cut bodice for the day or a more risque one for the evening. \u201cIt was made of expensive material so they wanted to get the most use out of it possible,\u201d said Tobin.One feature of the exhibition is the testimony of friends and volunteers of Killerton \u2013 home to the National Trust\u2019s biggest fashion collection with more than 20,000 items of historical clothing and accessories \u2013 about their favourite vintage pieces.Charlotte Eddington, for example, describes her beloved 1970s woollen Guernsey jumper that she persuaded her dad to hand down to her when it became too tight for him.

I would never have imagined then that one day they would be found as far north as Bath as we live with the realities of climate change.\u201dThe Jersey tiger moth used to be found on the Channel Islands, but has become an increasingly common sight across the south of England, including on the farm. Other recent new arrivals include the green meshweaver spider, the ivy bee and the lesser hornet hoverfly.Williams used to work as a professional ecology consultant for organisations such as Natural England and the National Trust.

Electricity prices are linked to wholesale gas costs, which have risen sharply since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Will Gardiner, the chief executive, said: \u201cDrax delivered a strong performance in 2022, and played a significant role in ensuring security of supply during a challenging year for the UK\u2019s energy system.\u201dDrax, which supplies up to 6% of the UK\u2019s electricity, and is seen as a source of when weather conditions preclude significant wind and solar power generation.Climate campaigners have accused Drax of greenwashing, arguing its biomass operations, which burn wood pellets to produce electricity, are far from green and can even increase the CO2 emissions driving the climate crisis.Most of the wood is imported from North America. The former energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng called its business model \u201cnot sustainable\u201d.Drax was the subject of a BBC Panorama investigation over alleged forest destruction and has also been accused of \u201cenvironmental racism\u201d.The power company said it had earned \u00a3837m in subsidies in 2020 and \u00a3885m in 2021. The level of support fell to \u00a3617m in 2022 as electricity prices exceed an agreed \u201cstrike price\u201d agreed to encourage renewable investment.This meant Drax paid out \u00a333m to the Low Carbon Contracts Company, a government-owned firm, compared with receiving \u00a3231m under the same mechanism a year earlier. However, it still received \u00a3650m under an older renewable energy scheme.The thinktank Ember has estimated that, from 2012 until 2027, when the support runs out, Drax would have collected more than \u00a311bn in subsidies.The Conservative MP Pauline Latham said: \u201cThe government pays significant sums in renewable energy subsidies to bioenergy companies making sizeable profits, despite it releasing huge amounts of greenhouse gases and harming forests\u2019 ability to absorb carbon.\u201cThis directly costs bill payers and families through their energy bills.

Their gains led to renewed calls for tougher windfall taxes.Some of Drax\u2019s operations are covered by the electricity generator levy introduced this year but the company said recognition in the construction of the tax that biomass costs were higher than those of windfarms meant the levy \u201cshould not have an adverse impact on biomass generation\u201d.Separately, more than 180 staff at the Drax plant near Selby, in North Yorkshire, have begun a series of strikes that will run through February, March and April after rejecting a proposed pay deal.The company also agreed to extend the life of two coal units through the winter after a government request, amid fears over power cuts.

But what are the options for the country\u2019s largest water and sewerage company?Special administrationThis is a power within the Water Industry Act 1991 to protect essential services for the public if a private company is either on the brink of collapse, or not fulfilling its legal obligations.It arranges to transfer the business as a going concern and, just as administrators do in other financial collapses, it enables them to carry out the functions of the company until that transfer. Crucially it is designed to protect an essential public service first and creditors do not have priority in getting their loans paid off.The company can be eventually transferred to another private company, as in the case of the electricity company Bulb in 2022, when the government subsidised the continued existence of Bulb as a private company and then transferred it to another private company. But it can also be used to transfer a company into public ownership, as in the case of Railtrack. When the privatised company owning the railway network collapsed in 2002 the special administration process resulted in a transfer to public ownership under Network Rail.Public English regional water companyDavid Hall, an expert in public utilities after privatisation, suggests special administration could be used for all three of the failing water companies serving the south-east of England. Southern Water, South East Water and Thames Water could be taken into special administration and transferred into public ownership under the councils in the region as the first regional publicly owned water company.Enforcement under section 18 of the Water Industry ActUnder the Water Industry Act 1991, ministers and the regulator can issue enforcement orders for a company to do their bidding \u2013 whether it is paying down debts, restructuring, reducing payouts to shareholders or keeping water bills down. Nevertheless, this could result in ministers being involved in the running of the company for many years \u2013 effectively a nationalisation under the definition of the National Statistics Office, but without any local accountability and participation. It could be strongly resisted by the private owners.Let Thames Water go bustThis endgame of a solution has been suggested as a way to take the company back into public ownership, by paying a penny for a collapsed company. But when water was privatised, there were safeguards to protect what is an essential public utility. Put simply, ministers and the regulator are not allowed to let this happen.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The full impact of the virus\u2019s arrival is not yet known, but scientists are raising concerns about possible \u201ccatastrophic breeding failure\u201d of the region\u2019s fragile wildlife populations.The virus was found in populations of a scavenging bird called brown skua on Bird Island, which is part of the British overseas territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. These migratory birds probably brought it with them from South America where bird flu is widespread and has already killed an estimated 500,000 seabirds and 20,000 sea lions in Chile and Peru alone.The current outbreak of the highly infectious variant of H5N1 \u2013 which started in 2021 \u2013 is estimated to have killed millions of wild birds. Researchers have long been concerned about its potential impact on Antarctic wildlife, because many species are found nowhere else in the world, and are not known to have been exposed to bird flu viruses before.Researchers from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) took swabs of the birds when they found unexplained mortality and sent them for testing in the UK.Ashley Bennison, the BAS science manager for Bird Island, said: \u201cThis is a particularly sad event to confirm. We will continue to monitor the species on the island as best as we can and keep the science going, but we are unsure of the full impact at the moment.\u201dBird Island is considered one of the planet\u2019s richest wildlife sites, home to many endangered bird species as well as 50,000 pairs of breeding penguins and 65,000 pairs of fur seals. The island lies just off the north-west tip of South Georgia, about 600 miles south-east of the Falkland Islands.Wild birds gain immunity to avian flu in \u2018encouraging sign\u2019 amid deadly outbreakRead moreA risk assessment on the impacts of bird flu reaching the continent, published by Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, said fur seals, sea lions, skuas and gulls were the most at risk, followed by penguins, birds of prey, sheathbills and giant petrels.Dr Meagan Dewar, the chair of the Antarctic Wildlife Health Network \u2013 who was the lead author of the report \u2013 said that the disease could result in \u201ccatastrophic breeding failure\u201d in the region, with a \u201cdevastating impact on many wildlife species\u201d.The report states that \u201congoing disease surveillance programmes should be established to identify new and emerging pathogens\u201d.H5N1 spread almost 4,000 miles down South America in the space of three months, facilitated by migration routes of wild birds. The fact it had already spread down South America made it likely it would arrive in South Georgia at some point, researchers say.As a result of the positive tests on Bird Island, most field work that involves animal handling has been suspended. Staff will have to be extra vigilant about ensuring they have clean clothing and field equipment.The news follows recent research that showed some seabirds in the UK \u2013 where the outbreak was first reported \u2013 are starting to show immunity to H5N1.",

Honeybees need nectar, pollen and water, collected from the surrounding environment, to make honey.The research found that several factors are hampering honeybees\u2019 ability to create honey, including an explosion in the use of herbicides, the conversion of previously flower-rich land into monocultural farmland and a decline in soil productivity.A major factor, since the early 1990s, in honey production has been the changing climate, with rising temperatures, altered rainfall patterns and extreme weather events wreaking havoc upon many beekeepers and their broods.\u201cIt\u2019s just so weather-dependent,\u201d said Christina Grozinger, study co-author and Penn State entomologist. \u201cIt\u2019s not just getting warmer and wetter, there are also these extreme events that mean you don\u2019t know what weather you\u2019ll be getting.\u201cYou can\u2019t really manage for that. We can manage the land in terms of reducing pesticides but long term we are going to have to think about what plants we can plant with these changing climatic conditions.\u201dHoneybee colonies have suffered severe losses during winters in recent years, with habitat loss, the climate crisis, pesticides and disease all taking their toll. There is a broader crisis among bees and insects more generally due these factors, which researchers have warned will affect food yields and cause the decline of ecosystems unless they are urgently addressed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Those include detections to the west of the Great Dividing Range for the first time, at Kleinton near Toowoomba, in the Moreton Bay area north of Brisbane, and on the Gold Coast.\u201cThe current eradication program is underfunded and this is leading to fire ants regularly breaching containment,\u201d Pianta said.The Invasive Species Council welcomed the NSW move to enact movement controls around the Tallebudgera site, but warned that it would only \u201cbuy some time\u201d before fire ants spread farther south.A strategic review of Australia\u2019s efforts to control an outbreak of red fire ants warned almost two years ago that an \u201curgent change of strategy\u201d was needed to prevent uncontrolled spread of the species.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was 88.Payne made the discovery in 1967 during a research trip to Bermuda when a navy engineer provided him with a recording of curious underwater sounds documented while listening for Russian submarines. Payne identified the haunting tones as songs whales sing to one another.The sound ecologist capturing a disappearing world: \u201870% of habitats I recorded are gone\u2019Read moreHe saw the discovery of whale song as a chance to spur interest in saving the giant animals, who were disappearing from the planet. Payne would produce the album Songs of the Humpback Whale in 1970. A surprise hit, the record galvanized a global movement to end the practice of commercial whale hunting and save the cetaceans from extinction. It remains the best-selling environmental album in history.Payne was conscious from the start that whale song represented a chance to get the public interested in protecting an animal previously considered little more than a resource, curiosity or nuisance.Payne died on Saturday of pelvic cancer. He lived in South Woodstock, Vermont, with his wife, the actor Lisa Harrow. Payne was born in New York City and educated at Harvard University and Cornell University.Payne had four children from a previous marriage to zoologist Katy Payne, with whom he collaborated. The two used primitive equipment in the late 1960s to record the sounds of humpback whales, which sometimes sing their eerie, complex songs for longer than a half hour at a stretch.The impact of the whale song discovery on the nascent environmental movement was immense. Many anti-war protesters of the day took on saving animals and the environment as a new cause, and the words \u201csave the whales\u201d became ubiquitous on tote bags and bumper stickers.Researchers have long debated how humpbacks use song, but there is broad agreement that they are sexual signals that male humpback whales use in an attempt to increase their mating opportunities.\u201cIt took time for me to notice, because while the whales do repeat themselves, several minutes often pass before the same stanza comes around again. Also, there are no breaks in their songs. Unlike birds, they sing a river of sound that flows on and on, sometimes for hours,\u201d Payne told Nautilus Quarterly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Mid Sussex district council has proposed a \u201cgreen path\u201d through the lush fields and pretty woodland of the nearby area, where people could walk and cycle.It would also give schoolchildren a healthy and safe way to travel to and from class, and reduce traffic on the main roads. This will become even more pressing as a secondary school is soon to be built between the two towns to accommodate 900 pupils and 70 staff.But while some landowners have granted permission for these pathways, the most realistic routes proposed by the council would have to partly depend on the permission of a local estate, owned by a baronet.Sir Richard Kleinwort has blocked permission for the viable routes proposed by the council, arguing it would take productive farmland from the estate to have a path running through, and that it may affect his agricultural activities.The estate is now closed to the public, but is available for film and TV crews to hire as a location. According to the website his Arts and Crafts mansion is \u201cset in 1,200 pristine acres\u201d, and offers formal gardens and woodlands in the rolling countryside.Labour government would pass right to roam act and reverse Dartmoor banRead moreThe estate has been owned by the Kleinwort banking dynasty since the 1800s. The family formed the investment bank Kleinwort Benson, which helped the British government with privatisation in the 20th century, advising on the flotation of British Aerospace, Cable & Wireless, Associated British Ports, British Telecom and Enterprise Oil.Sir Richard\u2019s grandfather, Ernest Kleinwort, played a vital role in the formation of the World Wildlife Fund, now World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), and Sir Richard has been a member of its UK council of ambassadors since 2000.Council documents show that for the routes to go ahead, they need \u201cconsiderably more landowner support\u201d, citing the lack of permission from the estate. There is one route the Kleinworts would allow, which is next to a busy railway line and the council has deemed too unsafe. Another, which they would allow in principle, is through an area that floods, so the council is unsure it can deliver it safely.The council said: \u201cThe appraisal process has emphasised the fact that to enable any feasible route between the two towns, cooperation is required from the Heaselands estate. Most routes, including the two preferred routes K and L, were not necessarily supported by the Heaselands estate due to loss of agricultural land or interference to estate activities.\u201dWhen appointed vice-lord lieutenant of West Sussex, Kleinwort, who like his ancestors is also a banker, said he wanted to \u201cgive to Sussex, as much as possible\u201d, adding: \u201cWe like to make a difference.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Colombia floats new strategy for Escobar\u2019s hippos: ship them abroadRead moreThe beasts escaped following Escobar\u2019s death, and with no predators in the Colombian countryside, they have multiplied into a plague of 150, becoming a threat to local people and a headache for Colombia\u2019s environment ministry.Hippo attacks on people have become more common in recent years, as the animals are highly territorial.Residents in the state of Antioquia live in growing fear of the invasive animals, who are jeopardising the livelihoods of local fishers and endangering the many animal species that inhabit Colombia\u2019s principal river.The aftermath of the crash. Photograph: TwitterThe accident reveals yet another danger that the invasive hippos pose to the local community, said Luz D\u00e1maris Luj\u00e1n, a community leader in Estacion Pita, a municipality 10km away from the scene of the crash.\u201cEveryone around here is terrified because we are flooded with these hippopotamuses. Now we\u2019re at the point where we can\u2019t even go out at night any more,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government needs to hurry up and do something, because we are getting tired of this.\u201dLast month, local fishers warned that it was likely only a matter of time before local residents killed one of the animals \u2013 although they predicted that it would be with bullets, not a 4x4.Other Colombians mourned the loss of the giant herbivore on social media and lamented the dark legacy of Escobar.\u201cYou feel sad for an innocent being that was just passing by. We should all feel guilty, because it is the work of us human beings,\u201d posted Luisa Lozano in response to a video showing the scene of the accident.The invasive species has been a thorny issue for successive Colombian governments. Studies estimate the population could rise as high as 1,400 by 2034, and ecologists warn that they must be culled before they cause more irreversible damage to the delicate ecosystem of the Magdalena river or cause their first human fatality.Recently, local officials have proposed shipping 70 of the animals to zoos and sanctuaries in Mexico and India, though experts are sceptical that the plan will succeed.An\u00edbal Gaviria Correa, the governor of Antioquia state, who is heading the plan to export Escobar\u2019s hippos, tweeted gruesome images of the crash and called for the president, Gustavo Petro, and the environment minister, Susana Muhamad, to support him in his plans to fly the beasts abroad.\u201cThis painful accident reaffirms the importance of urgently translocating the hippos from Doradal to India and Mexico \u2026 Please help us with permits for the transfer of these majestic animals,\u201d he said.",

They argue that a \u201csuper rate of air passenger duty (APD)\u201d should be applied to account for the damage caused to the planet. The CfBT also called on the government to strip private flights of their current VAT-free status.A glamorous and gilded New Year\u2019s Eve to you: how UK\u2019s wealthy can usher in 2023Read more\u201cPrivate jets are hugely damaging to the environment and are the preserve of the super-rich,\u201d said Norman Baker, the CfBT\u2019s director of external affairs and a former Liberal Democrat MP.Currently, private jet passengers are charged the same rate of APD as business or first-class passengers, with a higher rate applied to aircraft of 20 tonnes or more with fewer than 19 passengers onboard.The campaigners said the new super rate of APD on private jet travel should be set at 10 times the current higher rate for domestic and European trips, which would apply to all private jet passengers, regardless of the size or capacity of the aircraft or distance travelled. They said the tax could raise \u00a31.4bn-a-year \u2013 roughly equal to Network Rail\u2019s entire annual maintenance costs.In addition, CfBT said the government should charge VAT each time a private jet lands or takes off, regardless of size or distance travelled, which would raise a further \u00a379m-\u00a3623m.The number of private jets in operation rose by 7% last year and was up 47% on 2020, according to data from the private jet consultancy Wing-X. This contrasts starkly with scheduled passenger airline activity, which remained 35% below pre-pandemic levels.\u201cWith the UK responsible for 19% of Europe\u2019s carbon emissions from private jets \u2013 more than any other European country \u2013 Campaign for Better Transport is calling on the government to ensure that private jets pay for the pollution they cause and that the money is invested into public transport services,\u201d the charity said.A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cSince 2017, we have almost doubled transport spending to \u00a327.1bn to help strengthen road and rail connectivity, and from April 2023 air passenger duty will be lower for commercial domestic flights to further bolster links within the UK.\u201cLarger private jets will not benefit from the new lower domestic duty, and they will also pay more from the new ultra long-haul band on international flights, which ensures that those who fly the furthest contribute the most.\u201d",

        "text": "Returning to coal-fired power generation in some parts of Europe has not prevented strong progress on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, data shows.Emissions for November for the EU were at their lowest in at least 30 years, as were gas consumption, carbon from the power sector, and power generation from fossil fuels, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.This month\u2019s freeze may result in more coal and gas being burned in December, after an unusually mild November. Germany missed its targets on cutting consumption of gas under the cold conditions, the German grid agency said.But only a small proportion of last month\u2019s drop in fossil fuel use should be attributed to the weather, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air analysis. The mild temperatures contributed a 6% reduction in gas demand outside the power sector \u2013 mostly for heating \u2013 while actual demand fell 26%. Within the power sector, milder temperatures can account for two percentage points of the 12% drop in demand, the analysts found.Lauri Myllyvirta, a lead analyst and author of the report, said the data showed that accusations against the EU of falling back on climate commitments were wrong. \u201cThere has been a very widespread perception that Europe is going backwards on climate change, because of the Ukraine war,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were frequent remarks to that effect at Cop27, saying Europe was going back to coal. We are showing that has not been the case \u2013 there was a misreading of coal consumption.\u201dSome member states, including Germany and Poland, have sought a limited return to burning coal for power generation in the face of soaring gas prices and supply constraints in after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The UK has also put coal-fired power plants on standby.In November, the EU as a whole used less coal than in the same month last year, and than in the same month for the past three decades. Germany and Poland both used less coal than a year ago, though Finland slightly increased its coal use.There were dramatic reductions in output from nuclear reactors in Germany and France. In Germany that was made up for by an increase in wind and solar generation, while France reduced its power demand substantially.However, this month\u2019s cold spell, with temperatures about 5C lower than usual for the time of year, and snow and icy conditions across much of northern Europe, could stall progress on cutting fossil fuel use this winter.Myllyvirta said: \u201cEverything is conditional on the weather. If we have a big cold spell, we will see more gas burning.\u201dHe said early signs for December were that the trend for lower emissions was holding up. The first half of December had colder weather than the year before, he added, but total emissions remained well below 2021 levels, showing that the reduction in gas and electricity use was not mainly because of the weather.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Myllyvirta said the sector continued to be plagued by the poor performance of nuclear, and wind conditions were also poor, but reduced gas use outside the power sector kept emissions falling overall.He added that the transformation of Europe\u2019s energy this year showed that the underlying trend was strongly away from fossil fuels. \u201cIf anyone had said a year ago that Europe could nearly eliminate reliance on Russian fossil fuels in 10 months, they would have been taken for a complete lunatic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have come quite close to doing so, and that is quite remarkable.\u201dHe added that governments should seek to protect their most vulnerable citizens from the dangerous effects of the energy price rises that have forced such a sudden change. Europe could go further in weaning itself off Russian energy, and fossil fuels in general, but that should be managed equitably, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that so much of this reduction [in fossil fuel use] has happened through high prices, which is having major social and economic impacts,\u201d Myllyvirta said.",

Photograph: Arterra Picture Library/AlamyConservationists warned last month that the lynx population in Europe could collapse unless immediate efforts are made to protect the animals. Tests on the remaining cats in France show that their genetic diversity is so low they will become locally extinct within the next 30 years without intervention.There are around 1,450 lynx spread across Sweden, about 300 fewer than 10 years ago. Naturv\u00e5rdsverket, the Swedish environmental protection agency, argues that the country needs only 870 animals to maintain a healthy population.The Swedish hunters\u2019 association, Svenska J\u00e4garef\u00f6rbundet, admits the lynx do not pose a danger to humans. Henrik Falk, an adviser to the association, told the Guardian: \u201cThe hunt is absolutely not linked to any danger to humans. Neither is wolf hunting \u2013 there are no documented cases of wolves attacking humans in Swedish modern times.\u201cThe lynx hunt is more about the excitement, and for some hunters, of course, the skin is the motivation.\u201dLynx in Sweden are hunted using dogs. In France, they face extinction within 30 years. Photograph: Johner Images/AlamyLynx, like most other game animals in Sweden, are hunted using dogs. The EU Habitats Directive specifies that hunting may be allowed either to prevent damage to livestock or in the interests of public safety.It is \u201cstrongly questionable\u201d that either of these conditions applies to lynx in Sweden, said Benny G\u00e4fwert, a predator expert at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). \u201cWe do not think the hunters can invoke these exceptions, and we have notified the EU Commission,\u201d G\u00e4fwert said.Sweden just had the biggest wolf cull of modern times, where 54 of the animals were killed.  Photograph: Deco/Alamy\u201cThat hunting occurs, we do not, in itself, have a problem with, but the extent to which it occurs in relation to the low damage caused by the lynx is unwarranted.\u201dThe WWF is also challenging Sweden\u2019s explanation for its ongoing wolf cull, G\u00e4fwert said.Historically, lynx have ranged across Eurasia but have come under intense pressure in many countries from habitat loss, inbreeding, poaching and traffic collisions. In Britain, calls to reintroduce lynx to the wild were rejected last month by the environment minister, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey.Conservationists point to the role of lynx in controlling Sweden\u2019s large population of deer, moose and boar.The lynx hunt in Sweden is taking place during the mating season when their fur is thickest, making it particularly attractive to hunters, said Marie Stegard Lind of anti-hunting group Jaktkritikerna. \u201cThis is completely unnecessary \u2013 a pure trophy hunt,\u201d she said.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

The operation was described as the biggest evacuation ever carried out in Greece. A state of emergency was declared in some areas of the popular tourist destination this week.The fires killed at least five people and burned almost 50,000 hectares (124,000 acres) of forest and vegetation, according to estimates by the Athens Observatory.Two pilots died on Tuesday when their waterbombing plane crashed while battling a blaze in Evia, while three more bodies were recovered in fires in Evia and near the industrial zone of the port city of Volos in central Greece.The fires have also put political pressure on the conservative government of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, which was re-elected last month.The citizen\u2019s protection minister resigned on Friday after it emerged that he had taken a holiday as the country battled the wildfires.On Friday the country\u2019s senior climate crisis official said most of the 667 blazes in Greece were started \u201cby human hand\u201d.Vassilis Kikilias, the Greek minister of climate crisis and civil protection, told reporters: \u201cDuring this time 667 fires erupted \u2013 that is more than 60 fires a day \u2013 almost all over the country. Unfortunately, the majority were ignited by human hand, either by criminal negligence or intent.\u201dExperts have said the heatwave in Greece was the longest recorded in July for decades.Temperatures, which reached 46C (115F) this week, have since begun to fall.The national weather forecaster, EMY, predicted temperatures would not climb above 37C on Saturday, but that wind gusts could reach 37 mph.Fires have also flared in Croatia, Italy and Portugal this week, and blazes killed 34 in Algeria in extreme heat that has left landscapes tinder-dry.",

Now, scientists are warning that it is at risk of extinction and calling for action to save it.The blooms of the Rafflesia have become famous for their odour of decaying meat, produced to attract flesh-eating flies. But the genus \u2013 which includes the largest flowers in the world, at more than a metre across \u2013 is at risk due to the destruction of forest habitats in south-east Asia. There are 42 species of Rafflesia, and researchers warn that all of them are under threat, with 25 classified as critically endangered and 15 as endangered.More than two-thirds are not being protected by current conservation strategies, according to a new study published in the journal Plants, People, Planet. It is the first global assessment of the threats facing these plants.Chris Thorogood, an author of the study, with Rafflesia arnoldii, the largest flower in the world, in Sumatra. Photograph: Dr Chris ThorogoodDr Chris Thorogood, from the University of Oxford Botanic Garden, an author of the study, said the study \u201chighlights how the global conservation efforts geared towards plants \u2013 however iconic \u2013 have lagged behind those of animals\u201d.\u201cWe urgently need a joined-up, cross-regional approach to save some of the world\u2019s most remarkable flowers, most of which are now on the brink of being lost,\u201d he said.Due to their being largely hidden throughout their life cycle, the flowers are poorly understood, with new species still being found. Many populations are believed to contain only a few hundred individuals. \u201cAlarmingly, recent observations suggest taxa are still being eradicated before they are even known to science,\u201d researchers warn in the paper.Rafflesia is a parasitic plant that has no leaves, stems or roots, and does not photosynthesise. Instead, it uses long filaments that look like fungal cells to extract food and water from tropical jungle vines across Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. Rafflesia spends most of its life hidden within the vine, but then produces a cabbage-like bud that turns into a giant rubbery flower. The flower pollinates via a thick, sticky liquid that dries on to flies.After European explorers first discovered these plants in the late 18th century, seeing \u2013 or collecting \u2013 the flower became a goal of many expeditions, with scholars particularly fascinated with how it connected to the jungle vines.Rafflesia bengkuluensis with its custodians in Sumatra. Photograph: Dr Chris ThorogoodJust one species (Rafflesia magnifica) is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but researchers want all species to be added to the IUCN red list of threatened species.They are calling for greater protection of its habitats, better understanding of species that do exist, and new methods to propagate them. Currently, attempts to do this in botanic gardens have had limited success.Scientists also want to encourage ecotourism so local communities can benefit from Rafflesia conservation. \u201cIndigenous peoples are some of the best guardians of our forests, and Rafflesia conservation programmes are far more likely to be successful if they engage local communities,\u201d Adriane Tobias, a forester from the Philippines, said. \u201cRafflesia has the potential to be a new icon for conservation in the Asian tropics.\u201dFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X (formerly known as Twitter) for all the latest news and features",

But in August, just as a tugboat was about to tow it into the Mediterranean Sea, Turkish environmental authorities blocked the plan.Brazil then brought the aircraft carrier back but did not allow it into port, citing the \u201chigh risk\u201d to the environment.",

These policies are destructive for the planet, which is already boiling, and they will be negative for the UK\u2019s economy.\u201dHe added: \u201cWhile the US, the EU and China engage in a race to become leaders in clean technology, these decisions will scare off investors from modernising the UK\u2019s industry.\u201dPeter Liese, a German MEP with the centre-right group, said: \u201cGreat Britain is gambling with its pioneering role in international climate policy and risks confusing market participants on important technologies.\u201dHe added: \u201cMy group and I have always opposed the ban on combustion engines, and I also take a critical view of the ban on individual heaters.

        "text": "The endangered marsh fritillary butterfly is thriving again in a Lake District valley after ponies and cattle replaced the grazing of sheep.The butterfly became extinct in Cumbria 19 years ago but is spreading across the landscape again after an official reintroduction programme.This summer it has flown into the Swindale valley, part of Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) Haweswater, where conservationists were considering reintroducing the species.But they did not have to give it a direct helping hand because of radical changes in the grazing on the site, which is managed by the RSPB in partnership with the landowner, United Utilities.There were 1,600 breeding ewes on the 3,000-hectare site when the RSPB took over. There are now 280 and they are restricted to rotational grazing of lowland farmland, allowing many more wildflowers and plants to flourish.The butterfly returned to Swindale because of a big increase in its food plant, devil\u2019s-bit scabious. Previously, the valley meadows had become dominated by coarse grasses that the sheep refused to eat. When the RSPB introduced native fell ponies to graze every late autumn, they devoured the coarse grasses.\u201cThe next spring, it was absolutely carpeted in heath spotted orchids and later in the summer masses of devil\u2019s-bit scabious,\u201d said Lee Schofield, a senior site manager for the RSPB at Haweswater.\u201cThese flowers have spread and spread over the last few years. The fell ponies are the key to this success \u2013 if we hadn\u2019t changed the grazing and used these big native herbivores we wouldn\u2019t have the scabious and we wouldn\u2019t have the butterfly.\u201dHighland and belted Galloway cattle have also been brought back to lightly graze the meadows, and a more natural hydrology has been restored, creating more damp ground where the flowers thrive.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen so much devil\u2019s-bit scabious and I\u2019d be surprised if we don\u2019t see the marsh fritillary popping up throughout Swindale valley,\u201d said Schofield, whose book, Wild Fell, documents the transformation of the Lakeland reserve and the wider landscape.The grazing changes have also benefited grasshoppers, grass-feeding moth species and other butterflies, including the dark green fritillary and the small pearl-bordered fritillary.The marsh fritillary has been controversially reintroduced to many isolated sites across Britain by maverick breeders. Schofield said he could not rule out some \u201cskulduggery\u201d over the butterfly\u2019s reappearance at a few locations in Cumbria but it appears to have naturally spread into Swindale from the neighbouring valley, where it reappeared last year.The marsh fritillary\u2019s natural spread through Cumbria is a triumph for the original reintroduction programme overseen by Butterfly Conservation. The caterpillars form distinctive and often numerous larval webs but there was just one batch of caterpillars on one site in Cumbria by 2004, when the final 150 wild caterpillars were taken into captivity.Captive breeding revealed the isolated Cumbrian population had entered a genetic bottleneck whereupon most caterpillars failed to transform into adult butterflies. So, caterpillars were collected from southern Scotland to increase the genetic vigour of the species before nearly 50,000 captive-bred caterpillars were returned to four sites in 2007.Since then, the butterfly has begun to spread to suitably restored wet meadows in the region, creating a more resilient \u201cmeta-population\u201d, which the species requires so it does not become isolated and genetically restricted.Its prospects have further been boosted by the Cumbria Connect project, which is seeking to restore nature-friendly farming across 33,000 hectares \u2013 an area larger than Birmingham. The project, funded by the Endangered Landscapes Programme, is working with farmers who want to change their land management to restore more natural rivers and diverse grazing to revitalise a wide range of declining plants and animals.\u201cWe absolutely recognise the value of grazing and if we stopped I don\u2019t think the marsh fritillary would last very long,\u201d said Schofield.",

The severe heat and prolonged nature of this heat \u2013 ocean temperatures are likely to remain elevated for another month \u2013 has placed Florida\u2019s corals, particularly around the Florida Keys region, at severe risk.\u201cThe temperatures have clearly been higher than anything ever recorded before,\u201d said Derek Manzello, coordinator of Noaa\u2019s coral reef watch program. \u201cYou hear the word \u2018unprecedented\u2019 get thrown around a lot but Florida\u2019s corals have never been exposed to this level of heat stress before.\u201cThe big concern here is that the Florida Keys corals will experience a mass mortality and that will push the reef ecosystem towards a trajectory of degradation, with severe ramifications in terms of the ecological services it provides.\u201dFlorida\u2019s reefs are some of the most visited in the world by scuba divers and, as a treasure trove of marine life, a prized site for species such as spiny lobsters, snappers and stone crabs favored by fishers. But the corals have suffered deterioration over the past 50 years due to pollution and, increasingly, bleaching events due to the rising ocean temperatures caused by the burning of fossil fuels \u2013 there have been eight bleaching events since 1987.Scientists estimate that about 70% of Florida\u2019s reefs are losing material, with this erosion hastened by bleaching, which occurs during periods of spiking heat. When it gets too hot, algae leave the tissue of corals, leaving them white, or bleached, in color. If this persists, the coral is vulnerable to disease and can die. At the current rate of global heating, the world is on track to lose almost all of its corals.Despite efforts to manually replant some lost corals on Florida\u2019s increasingly threadbare reef, the current heatwave roiling oceans around the world looks set to be a hammer blow to the ecosystem, risking not only the many species that rely upon it but also the protective buffer to storms it provides to people living near Florida\u2019s coast.Florida is the epicenter of an extreme phenomenon that means that the region is \u201cmarching towards a Caribbean-wide heat stress event in a matter of days of weeks\u201d, according to Manzello. The risk to corals extends all the way down to South America, with confirmed coral bleaching off Mexico, Costa Rica, Cuba and Colombia.\u201cThe heat event unfolding along the Meso-American Reef is literally off the scale,\u201d tweeted Terry Hughes, a coral reef scientist at James Cook University in Australia. \u201cA devastating blow to Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras, and elsewhere in the Caribbean.\u201dThe loss of corals could be even more widespread, with Noaa forecasting that the world may soon be in the grip of a coral bleaching disaster on the scale of, or even surpassing, the huge bleaching event that occurred in 2016. \u201cWe are concerned we are potentially moving towards a global event. All the indicators are in line with that happening,\u201d said Manzello.The stark warning over the world\u2019s corals, which sit on the frontlines of the climate crisis, came as Noaa outlined the extreme heat that has enveloped much of the world. July was the hottest month ever recorded by modern instrumentation, the agency confirmed, with a nearly 50% chance that 2023 will be the hottest ever year.The heat, driven by human-caused climate change, is fueling disasters such as flooding and deadly heatwaves. In the US alone, Noaa said, there have been 15 disasters that cost at least $1bn in damages in the first seven months of the year, which is a record. This doesn\u2019t include the catastrophic fires in Maui, Hawaii, where at least 110 people are thought to have died in an event scientists say was worsened by hot, tinderbox-like conditions.\u201cThis has been the summer of extremes,\u201d said Sarah Kapnick, Noaa\u2019s chief scientist. \u201cClimate change is enhancing certain extreme events. We will see these events increase in magnitude for every additional ton of greenhouse gas we put into the atmosphere.\u201d",

If Shell finds a buyer who wants more than 30%, then Ithaca could add a further 19.99% of its own interest to create a working interest of almost 50%.Alan Bruce, the Ithaca CEO, said the Shell agreement was a meaningful step towards developing the Cambo field, which could be \u201ca key asset in helping maintain the UK\u2019s future energy security\u201d.Shell announced in late 2021 it would pull out of any future investment in Cambo in what many climate campaigners had believed would deal a \u201cdeathblow\u201d to the project.The oilfield\u2019s prospects were revived last year when Ithaca Energy became the majority owner after paying about $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) to buy private-equity backed Siccar Point Energy, the operator of the field.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

China imported Japanese seafood worth 149.02m yuan ($20.43m) in August, the data showed.China, Japan\u2019s biggest market for seafood, has condemned the discharge, with the customs agency saying it risks the \u201cradioactive contamination of food safety\u201d. China\u2019s foreign ministry said it was an \u201cextremely selfish and irresponsible act\u201d.Britain and the US have voiced support for the water release and the European Union commended the Japanese authorities for \u201cproviding regular updates on the Fukushima status in a timely and transparent manner\u201d. South Korea\u2019s government has said it accepted the science behind the IAEA\u2019s report, despite safety concerns among a large section of the South Korean public.The US ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, drew an angry response from Beijing after he accused China of using \u201ceconomic coercion\u201d in imposing the seafood ban while its own boats continued to fish off Japan\u2019s coast.\u201cEconomic coercion is the most persistent and pernicious tool in their economic toolbox,\u201d Emanuel said last week. \u201cChina is engaged right now in fishing in Japan\u2019s economic waters while they are simultaneously engaged in the unilateral embargo on Japan\u2019s fish.\u201dIn response, China\u2019s foreign ministry said Emanuel should stop encouraging Japan\u2019s \u201cirresponsible\u201d behaviour.Tokyo protested against the ban in a document it submitted this month to the World Trade Organization, describing it as \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d.The ban is already having an impact on businesses in Japan, where there are reports of scallops and other seafood piling up in freezers at processing plants in the northernmost main island of Hokkaido, where 64% of seafood exports went to China.The Fukushima water became contaminated after it was used to cool three nuclear reactors that melted down after Fukushima Daiichi was struck by a powerful tsunami in March 2011.",

The ice extent is expected to shrink even further before this year\u2019s summer melting season ends.The impact of the climate crisis in melting sea ice in the Arctic is clear in the records that stretch back to 1979. Antarctic sea ice varies much more from year to year, which has made it harder to see an effect from global heating.However, \u201cremarkable\u201d losses of Antarctic sea ice in the last six years indicate that the record levels of heat now in the ocean and related changes in weather patterns may mean that the climate crisis is finally manifesting in the observations.Scientists were already very concerned about Antarctic ice. Climate models suggested as far back as 2014 that the giant West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), which sits on the continent, was doomed to collapse due to the levels of global heating already seen then.Rising seas threaten \u2018mass exodus on a biblical scale\u2019, UN chief warnsRead moreThe increasing loss of sea ice exposes ice sheets and their glaciers to waves that accelerate their disintegration and melting, researchers warned. A recent study estimated that the WAIS would be tipped into gradual collapse \u2013 and four metres of sea level rise \u2013 with a global temperature rise as low as 1C, a point already passed.\u201cI have never seen such an extreme, ice-free situation here before,\u201d said Prof Karsten Gohl, from the Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in the Alfred Wegener Institute, Germany, and who first visited the region in 1994.Gohl, on board the research vessel Polarstern in Antarctica, said: \u201cThe continental shelf, an area the size of Germany, is now completely ice-free. It is troubling to consider how quickly this change has taken place.\u201dProf Christian Haas, also at the Helmholtz Centre, said: \u201cThe rapid decline in sea ice over the past six years is quite remarkable, since the ice cover hardly changed at all in the 35 years before.\u201dScientists at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in the US have also said a new record low has been set.

Earlier studies have linked low sea ice cover with wave-induced stresses on the floating ice shelves that hem the continent, leading to break up of weaker areas.\u201dThe German scientists said the \u201cintense melting\u201d could be due to unusually high air temperatures to the west and east of the Antarctic peninsula, which were about 1.5C above the long-term average. Furthermore, there have been strong westerly winds, which increase sea ice retreat. The result is \u201cintensified melting of ice shelves, an essential aspect of future global sea-level rise\u201d, the researchers said.Historical records also show dramatic changes in Antarctica, they said. The Belgian research vessel Belgica was trapped in massive pack ice for more than a year in the Antarctic summer 125 years ago, in exactly the same region where the Polarstern vessel is now sailing in completely ice-free waters.Prof Carlos Moffat, at the University of Delaware, US, and recently returned from a research cruise in the Southern Ocean, told Inside Climate News: \u201cThe extraordinary change we\u2019ve seen this year is dramatic.

The subsistence farmer struggled to make ends meet and used to catch fish illegally from the lakes of nearby Akagera national park until a government crackdown on poaching in 2010 pushed him and others to Gishanda.The unchecked plundering depleted the lake\u2019s stocks of tilapia. Soon there were no fish left to either eat or sell.Now Ndagijimana is on a mission to reverse the damage. He manages Gishanda Fish Farm, which is based on the banks of the lake to cultivate tilapia and restock the waters.In April, the first fingerlings (young fish) raised in the farm were released into the water. More than 100,000 have been released so far and the ambition is to produce 1.5 million fingerlings each year.My father was a fisher who poached for money.

I wanted to carry on his legacy but in a way that is legal, professional and would benefit the community as a whole,\u201d says Ndagijimana, as he sprinkles granules of fish food into one of 16 tanks in the farm\u2019s main building.The farm opened in October with funding and support from the conservation organisation African Parks; FoodTechAfrica, a public-private partnership of 21 companies and universities; and the Dutch government.Ndagijimana wants the farm to produce about 30 tonnes of tilapia annually, of which at least 10% will be sold to the 600 households who live around the lake at half the market price \u2013 1,500 Rwandan francs (\u00a31.13) for a kilo, instead of 3,000. It is hoped the move will not only deter illegal fishing but improve nutrition for the villagers.Powered by solar energy and using a recycled water system, Gishanda Fish Farm aims to produce 30 tonnes of tilapia a year.\u201cIt is exciting for me to work as a fish farm manager where I was born. When my father congratulates me, seeing how our community is changing positively with my intervention, I am motivated further,\u201d says Ndagijimana, who studied aquaculture at the University of Rwanda and spent a year in Israel researching sustainable agriculture.He always had ambitions to return home to work.

It shows that the crises experienced by children, and by the adults coming to terms with those crises, are part of a larger ecosystem of emotional difficulty in the extended family.Ane (Patricia L\u00f3pez Arnaiz) is a sculptor living in south-west France. She has money worries and problems in her marriage to Gorka (Martxelo Rubio). They have three children, of whom the most troubled is Coc\u00f3 (Sof\u00eda Otero). Eight-year-old Coc\u00f3\u2019s worries and self-questioning emerge when Ane has to take the kids away for a summer break over the border in the Basque Country of Spain, staying with her widowed mother Lourdes (Ane Gaberain), who is now devoted to her beekeeping hobby but whose main occupation was once managing financial accounts for her husband, an artist, like Ane.Coc\u00f3\u2019s given name was in fact originally the boy\u2019s name Aitor, but switched to the indeterminate nickname Coc\u00f3 \u2013 though even this now feels wrong and Coc\u00f3 asks Ane to use the name \u201cLuc\u00eda\u201d. And it turns out that Luc\u00eda only really feels calm and happy in the company of her grandmother and her bees, of which there are, significantly, many different sorts. But there are troubles ahead when a family christening looms at which Luc\u00eda and the other children are expected to wear special formal clothes and Luc\u00eda will want to wear a dress. Heartsinkingly, Luc\u00eda even asks if she can die and be born again as a girl.Ane does not wish to deny Luc\u00eda\u2019s gender identity, although it is never exactly phrased in these terms, but she has concerns, and her husband worries that it is too early to be thinking like this in the first place. But Ane has identity issues of her own: her identity as an artist. Over the summer she wants to work on sculpture projects in the workshop that her late father used, and it is clear that this is a subject of some pain to her mother, because Ane\u2019s father became notorious in the locality for taking naked photographic studies of young girls. And her grandmother, calmly content to use Luc\u00eda\u2019s female pronouns, tells Ane not to \u201cturn a blind eye\u201d to Luc\u00eda\u2019s wishes in the same way that she turned a blind eye to what was happening with her husband.There is food for thought in that analogy. And the confrontation between Ane and her mother over the value of Ane\u2019s vocation as an artist has, in its way, a sharply human dramatic point that the rest of the movie perhaps does not. But it is a warm and generously performed film. 20,000 Species of Bees screened at the Berlin film festival and is released on 27 October in UK cinemas and on Curzon Home Cinema.",

It makes up 60% of our cartilage and accounts for 70 to 80% of the dry weight of skin, also featuring in other connective tissues such as tendons, muscles and bones.It gives our bodies elasticity and resilience, but its production slows down as we age, leading to more aches and pains and making us look older and more wrinkly. Factors such as sun exposure and smoking, along with chronic stress, lack of sleep or exercise, can speed its decline.The desire to mitigate these ageing effects has contributed to a global industry estimated to be worth $4bn (\u00a33.32bn) in 2022. There are 28 different types of collagen, and collagen products range from texture-enhancing food additives and meat casings to health supplements and beauty products.Collagen can be sourced from pigs, chicken and fish \u2013 but collagen from cows makes up 34% of the market. Grand View Research attributes this to \u201cthe high availability of cattle and lower prices\u201d.For anyone lamenting the loss of suppleness in their skin, a nicely packaged cream loaded with collagen might seem worth a try, but it\u2019s unlikely the ingredient will be effective in this form.Topical collagen would need to penetrate deep beneath the skin\u2019s surface to be useful, but its fibres are too large to get through the outer layer. Despite the science, however, it remains a popular product at beauty counters, with all the big brands including it in their ranges.Collagen types I, II and III are the most important in skin and musculoskeletal health.

However, it has now largely been replaced by hyaluronic acid fillers which, unlike collagen, break down after a few months and carry less risk of an allergic reaction.There are supplements labelled \u201cvegan collagen\u201d that don\u2019t contain actual collagen. What they mean is that they are vegan alternatives that contain vitamins and minerals that may help jumpstart our own collagen production, or the same amino acids found in collagen, from plant sources.Researchers are genetically modifying certain yeasts and bacteria to produce human type I collagen in a process similar to how medical insulin is made.

It implemented a hosepipe ban and blamed increased working from home for growing demand.Southern Water and Thames have remained on Ofwat\u2019s financial watchlist despite receiving significant investment in recent years. Southern has been handed \u00a3905m of equity investment since September 2021, and Thames Water has received \u00a3500m with shareholder agreement for further equity support.

While in Tunisia, temperatures are 6C to 10C above the average for this time of year.Athens is expected to be hotter than 40C for at least six to seven days, according to the meteorologist Panagiotis Giannopoulos. Successive days of extreme heat are unusual for the Greek capital.Government ministries have advised people to work from home where possible and not to go out unnecessarily. Key tourism sites will be closed during the hottest part of the day, including the Acropolis, a world heritage site, which will be shut from midday to 5.30pm every day until Sunday.A 46-year-old man was reported to have died from heat stroke after being admitted to Chalkida hospital on the central island of Evia.

        "text": "Two years after the government banned plastic straws, cotton buds and microbeads in some beauty products in England, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey is set to ban single-use plastic plates, cutlery and polystyrene cups. That means possibly 1.1bn plates and 4.25bn items of cutlery in England will no longer be made each year.That sounds impressive, as if the environment secretary is getting on top of the plastics that are used only once but last for centuries, breaking down into innumerable tiny pieces and polluting rivers and seas in the process. But the new ban barely scratches the surface of a problem that has been known about for decades and is now out of control.Not only has Coffey been shamed into taking action by the Scottish and Welsh governments, which both moved last year on plastic waste, but the English ban mysteriously appears to apply only to plastic used in takeaway outlets and not in supermarkets or shops.There are few pollutants more insidious \u2013 or urgent to tackle \u2013 than plastic. Micro-plastics extend from ocean trenches to mountain tops. Plastic is found in human bodies and the food we eat, and it literally rains down on people and animals. But the ban is too narrow in its scope. It won\u2019t cover single-use plastic water bottles, makes no mention of plastic bags and does not even try to control the burning of plastic waste in incinerators. There is still no deposit return scheme for drinks containers and no crackdown on the export of plastic waste to poorer countries.\u201cA plastic fork can take 200 years to decompose,\u201d trumpeted Coffey when announcing the ban. Yet by the time the new law is passed, it will have taken about 18 months of consultation, numerous environment secretaries and immense public pressure just to achieve this minimal advance. At this rate it will take more than 200 years to stop plastic pollution altogether.Clearly the government has little intention of acting comprehensively anytime soon. There is no financial incentive for catering or fast-food companies to switch out of single-use plastic and nothing to encourage the catering industry or households to recycle more. Local authorities are not to be helped in any way to clean up the plastic that litters beaches or roadside verges. There will be no curb on the production of single-use plastic, only of certain ill-defined items in selective places. It seems like the legislation will be full of loopholes.Quite simply, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, plagued by claims of inaction and delay over sewage being pumped into English waterways and hammered for its slow and weak air pollution targets, has been politically embarrassed enough to introduce minimal legislation that will give the impression of taking action. Undermined by an ideological commitment to let big industry do what it likes, it has picked on fast-food outlets, many of which provide cheap food, and framed plastic waste as litter created by the public. The real problem is the production of plastic by an immensely powerful global petrochemical industry that produces the materials to make the world\u2019s plastics.Plastic has been on an unstoppable roll for 70 years. Unrestrained by governments, the petrochemical industry is bucking the global recession and building vast new plastic plants, such as a giant new Shell plant in Pennsylvania, to create lucrative new markets for populations in industrialising countries. Today, the fossil fuel industry relies on profits from plastic to offset expected future losses from a transition to renewable energy.The scale of plastic pollution, especially in the marine environment, is now huge, though well known to governments. Roughly half of all plastic goes to single-use items, of which about 40% is packaging. Yet under 10% is recycled. The shocking fact is that virtually every piece of plastic made still exists in some shape or form, with the exception of the small amount that has been incinerated.England and Wales\u2019s broken water system can be fixed \u2013 here\u2019s what to do first | Dieter HelmRead moreBritain took the global lead when it passed its Climate Change Act in 2008. It set up a powerful independent advisory committee and committed to a net zero strategy. It now has the opportunity to lead UN negotiations to pass the first global plastics pollution treaty, intended to eventually reduce plastic production by half.But it must not wait for UN consensus, which is painfully slow to achieve and will inevitably be strongly opposed by the fossil fuel lobby. It could take the moral high ground and lead by example. Reining in the plastics industry would cost the public purse nothing, restore confidence in governments\u2019 ability to address these urgent problems, and stop Britain looking like an eco-laggard.\nJohn Vidal is a former Guardian environment editor\n",

        "text": "Countries, companies and cities need to establish environmental justice targets to counter the impact of the climate and other crises on global inequality, according to the authors of the most comprehensive study of the issue to date.From floods in Pakistan to air pollution in India, the Earth Commission researchers say the poorest parts of the world are being disproportionately harmed by environmental problems, which is adding to global injustice and threatening social stability.To counter this, they propose the creation of environmental justice targets similar to those submitted by governments on reaching the Paris agreement goal of limiting global heating to between 1.5C and 2C.Their plan, which was outlined at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, is billed as the first attempt to factor justice into an assessment of the state of the planet. It is based on a three-year Earth Commission study that brings together dozens of the world\u2019s leading nature scientists and social scientists to understand Earth\u2019s capacity to sustain life, and the role humans play as guardians. Their findings and recommendations will be published over the coming months.UN head accuses fossil fuel firms of business models \u2018inconsistent with human survival\u2019Read more\u201cPlanetary stability is not possible without a justice approach,\u201d said Joyeeta Gupta, a professor of environment and development at the University of Amsterdam, who is one of the lead authors. \u201cIt took a long time to persuade the nature scientists.\u201dShe said the concept of justice needed to be applied between generations and species, as well as within the current human population. It should minimise harm and define minimum levels of access to food, water, energy and infrastructure.Her co-chair of the study, Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, said the inclusion of social science was the next step in his work to define a safe operating space for humanity. Previously, he led teams that defined a range of planetary boundaries, including for climate, land system change, freshwater use, chemical pollution, ocean acidification and biodiversity. With the new study, he is collaborating with social scientists to map where just boundaries are different from safe boundaries.The initial papers are expected to launch a debate about the fairest as well as the safest way to use the planet\u2019s remaining space for development. Or in the cases where boundaries have already been crossed, to minimise impacts. Some of the proposed measures can be applied immediately, the authors said, such as ensuring every square kilometre in cities has a minimum area of green space.In future, the Earth Commission will examine whether there are social tipping points that can lead to rapid collapse. \u201cThis is an area of active research right now,\u201d Rockstr\u00f6m said. \u201cWe need to ask what is the point when social systems break rather than continuously coping. My personal assessment is the first social system that is breaking may be small-scale farming. We\u2019ve already see signs of that among farmers in Tanzania who have abandoned cultivating because the rains are so delayed. It is not gradual, they just give up and abandon the whole operation.\u201d",

It found 22% of the items in a typical British grocery shop were at risk.Some effects have been seen already. Earlier this year, UK supplies of tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce, peppers and citrus fruits ground to a halt as drought hit parts of Spain and Morocco.Yadira Lemus\u2019s family has been farming coffee in the hills of Honduras for generations, with their farmland almost perfect for the crop. \u201cWe would plant coffee and it produced almost by itself,\u201d she said.But old certainties can no longer be relied upon. \u201cIt is harder to predict the weather,\u201d Lemus told researchers from Christian Aid. \u201cBefore we could say which is winter or summer, and when we can plant. Not any more.\u201d\u2018There will be fewer British tomatoes on the shelves\u2019: soaring energy costs force growers to quitRead moreLemus, who is part of a women\u2019s group working with the support of Christian Aid partners to implement climate adaptation projects, said the difficulties she and fellow coffee cultivators were facing were \u201cobviously related to climate change\u201d.She said: \u201cWho was going to predict that we were going to have the storms and hurricanes we had last year? Now you see there is a lack of rain. We are more vulnerable to these types of changes.\u201dFurther global heating would mean more harvest-destroying extreme weather events, researchers say, leaving consumers facing further shortages and long-term prices rises. In March, annual food price inflation in the UK reached an all-time high of 19% \u2013 the second highest figure in the G7, after Germany.\u201cThe UK may be an island but in an ever more interconnected world we cannot escape the damage caused by climate change,\u201d said Patrick Watt, chief executive of Christian Aid.He said: \u201cOur record on carbon emissions has helped cause the climate crisis. Farmers in some of the world\u2019s poorest countries are now struggling to cope with droughts, storms and rising temperatures.\u201cThe climate crisis is increasingly disrupting the supply chains of the food in British shopping baskets and risks adding to the cost-of-living crisis. The case for action has never been clearer. The UK government must work with others to provide the financial support needed to help vulnerable communities adapt to a fast-changing climate.\u201dSmallholder farmers in low-income countries were suffering the most extreme consequences of the climate crisis, said Alexander Carnwath, head of public affairs at the Fairtrade Foundation.He said: \u201cThis is an important and timely report from Christian Aid, drawing the connection between the threat that climate change poses to the livelihoods of farmers, and the food we eat in the UK.

        "text": "BP\u2019s climate goals must not \u201cevaporate\u201d along with another chief executive, campaign groups have said after the shock resignation of Bernard Looney.The chief executive is stepping down after three years at the helm of Britain\u2019s biggest petroleum company after failing to disclose full details of relationships with colleagues, although many old-school shareholders had also reportedly been putting pressure on him over his plans for a net zero energy transition by 2050.Looney had already been forced to backtrack on those plans earlier this year, but BP remained the only major oil company aiming to cut fossil fuel output by the end of the decade.Tessa Khan, the executive director of Uplift, said: \u201cLooney understood that the industry\u2019s social licence is hanging by a thread. Any rowing back on his already desperately inadequate plan would sever it completely.\u201cIf people inside BP are baulking at even this, which is so out of step with what\u2019s needed to stay within habitable climate limits, it exposes the enormous gulf between what the industry is saying publicly and what they really think.\u201dThe International Energy Agency has said none of the oil supermajors are moving fast enough to prevent dangerous levels of global warming. Under Looney, BP had put a little more meat on the bones of the company\u2019s net zero target. He increased investment in renewable energies, hired more clean-tech specialists, and astonished many industry analysts by stating the company did not expect to pump all of the fossil fuels in its reserves.Petroleum investors have been hard to convince. Despite record profits of $28bn last year, BP\u2019s share price has performed poorly compared with rivals who have used the Ukraine war as an excuse to scale back their climate commitments and talk up the need for increased production.According to the Wall Street Journal, shares in BP have risen by about 7% since Looney became chief executive in February 2020, compared with a 25% climb for Shell. \u201cHowever, Chevron, up 51%, and Exxon Mobil, which has gained 87%, leave both in the dust,\u201d the report said.The pressure on Looney, 53, was evident earlier this year when he announced a watering down of his energy transition plan. Instead of the previous target of a 40% cut in oil and gas production by 2030, he said BP would aim for 25%.This frustrated climate activists, but Looney pointed out that his company was still ahead of its peers. \u201cWe\u2019re holding our nerve on the transition,\u201d he told reporters earlier this month. \u201cI believe that\u2019s what the world needs. And I believe it\u2019s our job to prove that is in the long-term interests of our shareholders.\u201dLooney was the last of a generation of BP managers to be mentored by the former chief executive John Browne, who also promised bold steps towards a clean energy transition at the start of the century. He too was forced to quit after admitting he had lied to court about a relationship. After this, BP delayed climate action and increased its cash-cow business of hydrocarbon extraction.Climate campaigners said the oil company must not repeat this mistake. Charlie Kronick, of Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cWhoever takes the reins at BP must significantly build on Looney\u2019s green ambitions, not walk them back. Too often, corporate climate pledges evaporate with a CEO\u2019s departure; their choice of a new CEO will be a litmus test of the BP board\u2019s climate credentials.\u201cThe departure of any chief executive can\u2019t be an excuse for oil and gas giants to avoid taking the action needed to prevent the worst impacts of climate change.\u201dGreenpeace urged BP to move forwards because it said its policies were still far behind what was needed to prevent dangerous levels of global heating.Market analysts, however, said the change in leadership would give BP the space to rethink its approach, and push back the trajectory of emissions.The interim chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, told staff BP would stay the course. \u201cOur strategy hasn\u2019t changed. And our focus remains on performance \u2013 quarter by quarter,\u201d he told an internal meeting, according to Reuters.",

It found the lungs of the rodent residents of Richmond fare far better than those of central Westminster.The research \u2013 published last week in the journal Environmental Pollution \u2013 highlights the extent of air contamination in cities and suggests that many other species, including wild animals and birds as well as pet cats and dogs, could be affected by particles in the air from traffic and other sources.\u201cIn recent years, there have been sharp drops in populations of species that had previously adapted quite well to city life,\u201d said researcher Patricia Brekke of the Zoological Society London. \u201cThese have included butterflies, bees, sparrows, starlings and hedgehogs. All have suffered massive recent losses of numbers.\u201dOne possible explanation has been the effect of air pollution, although there has been a lack of direct evidence to support the idea in wild mammals. The squirrel research aimed to fill that gap.UK study adds to evidence of air pollution link to long-term illnessRead moreThe grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) \u2013 which is native to North America \u2013 was introduced to Britain in the late 1800s and has since spread over most of England and Wales at the expense of the native red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris).Apart from being bigger, grey squirrels often carry the squirrelpox virus which rarely affects them but often kills red squirrels. As a result, the grey is now considered to be a pest and culls are carried out regularly. Researchers used these animals as the subjects for their research.The team studied 106 culled animals from five London boroughs \u2013 Camden, Greenwich, Haringey, Richmond upon Thames and Westminster \u2013 as well as two rural sites at Alice Holt, Surrey and Penrhyn Castle, north Wales. The squirrels were examined for symptoms of lung disease; for the presence of black carbon particles in their lung tissue; and for the signs of damage to lymph node tissue that is known as bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue.\u201cWe found that squirrels who had come from the inner city had a lot more black carbon in their lung tissue but less lymphoid tissue in their lungs compared with those that had been culled from outer regions of London,\u201d said Simon Priestnall, of the Royal Veterinary College, London.\u201cIn short, the lungs of those squirrels that were culled in Westminster in central London were much worse off than those that came from the city\u2019s outskirts, like leafy Richmond. And of course, air pollution is at its worst in the heart of a city as opposed to its outskirts.\u201dA main cause of this tainting of the air occurs in the city when microscopic particulates are pumped into the atmosphere from construction work and traffic. Sources include diesel fumes as well as particulates from tyres and brake linings. This makes humans highly vulnerable to its impact. It was estimated in one recent research study that air pollution contributed to around 6,000 excess deaths in London in 2019.It is also known that neurodegenerative diseases have higher rates among people who live in city centres compared with those who live elsewhere,\u201d added Brekke. \u201cThe question is: are other species affected this way?\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Without a formal spending cap, it could eventually top $US1trillion ($1.44tn).\u201cIt\u2019s not just money,\u201d Debelle told a gathering of business economists in Sydney on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s actually people, it\u2019s expertise and knowhow, which [are] migrating to the US.\u201dOil-rich Middle Eastern nations had also \u201cseen the writing on the wall\u201d of a shift off fossil fuels and were pouring resources and making land available for firms to tap renewable energy resources and develop a hydrogen sector.\u201cThere\u2019s a risk that, despite Australia\u2019s great comparative advantages in green energy, the US and the Middle East are going to eat our lunch,\u201d Debelle, who was also formerly a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, said.The Australian\u2019s back-of-the-envelope green hydrogen figures are overblown and forget climate impact | Temperature CheckRead moreMany nations are investing heavily in hydrogen as an alternative fuel to oil, gas and coal. Debelle said the US spending had the potential to lower the cost of making hydrogen from $6/kilogram to $2.50/kg. That would be comparable to fossil fuels.One outcome for Australia, if governments didn\u2019t provide \u201ca more targeted response\u201d, was that markets to the north such as Japan and South Korea \u2013 which had relatively poor renewable energy resources \u2013 would be snapped up by the US or other rivals.\u201cI\u2019m really concerned that we are missing out on a huge opportunity,\u201d he said.Debelle also warned Australian businesses to focus on reducing their greenhouse gas emissions directly, rather than relying on buying carbon offsets to try to cancel them out.Those \u201cmisaligned decarbonisation incentives\u201d could leave firms vulnerable to higher costs as carbon credits \u201cwill get more expensive\u201d, he said. Future market restrictions, such as from the European Union, could also leave them vulnerable if they had not cut emissions.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about people waiting for long \u2026 and that means we don\u2019t get the nascent industry off the ground here,\u201d Debelle said, adding he could foresee companies scrambling to find alternatives \u201cbut the solutions take three or four years to build\u201d.In Australia, scale could determine which localities succeeded in fostering a hydrogen industry. Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia were more likely to have the size for exports, given their solar and wind resources.States such as NSW, though, had the scope to supply local industries. Fortescue Future Industries, for instance, was working with AGL Energy to repurpose its Liddell coal-fired power station after it shuts completely by April.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "A scientist has started a national investigation into curlews, after noticing in a small-scale study that some of the eggs being laid by the endangered birds were unusually fragile and crumbly.If it emerges that the problem is widespread, the fragile eggs could pose a grave risk to the future of the species, which has declined significantly in Scotland, England and Wales and by 42% between 1995 and 2008 in the UK overall.Dr Nicola Hemmings, a researcher in the school of biosciences at the University of Sheffield, started working with the Curlew Recovery Partnership (CRP) conservation group last year.She said: \u201cI looked at a very small number of eggs because the CRP thought there might be some fertility issues. All of them were fertilised and showed some sign of embryo development but at least half of them had flaky, brittle or crumbly thin fragile shells. We have this hint there could be a problem here. It\u2019s worth noting that those eggs with particularly thin shells had embryos that died in particularly late development.\u201dThis finding worried her, so she asked the partnership to get samples from across the UK to see if it was widespread and whether there was any pattern with regard to egg quality and hatching success.Nest monitors have been asked to send failed eggs and egg fragments to Hemmings, who will be analysing them to find out why they are becoming so crumbly. \u201cWe want to assess what degree this is a threat to the recovery of the curlew,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThe first step is to find out if this issue is widespread, then the next step will be to try to identify what the problem is, so what\u2019s causing the problem with these eggshells. We will analyse eggshell samples to look for environmental contaminants that might be leading to poor eggshell quality and also look for evidence of poor nutrition.\u201dSign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am BSTIf researchers are able to identify a problem, conservation teams could work with landowners in the area to reduce the pollution near curlew sites, or help the birds that are not finding enough food.If the issue is inbreeding because of the constricted population, rather than something that is easier to fix, such as environmental pollution, the outlook would be poor. However, there are hopes inbreeding may not be the problem.Hemmings said: \u201cThe one thing that did seem quite hopeful from our analysis last year was that the fertility issue didn\u2019t seem to be a massive problem. These eggs were fertilised, which is the first thing people think of with respect to genetic or inbreeding problems. Doing this kind of UK-wide assessment will help us identify whether there are any problems with particular pockets and if there are any fertility issues arising.\u201dIt is important that members of the public do not disturb nest sites, but conservationists involved in the study have been asked to keep an eye out for failed eggs, which they need to get into a fridge before sending them for analysis. They have also been asked for larger fragments from hatched eggs, to enable analysis of shell thickness at a range of locations.The loss of the curlew has been most dramatic in the lowlands, and it is estimated there are most 300 pairs below Birmingham . It is thought these birds could die out in eight years if nothing changes. The curlew was added to the UK red list in 2015.Prof Russell Wynn, who runs the CRP, said: \u201cThe UK and Ireland holds a quarter of the world\u2019s breeding curlews, mostly concentrated in upland areas of northern England and Scotland. However, after dramatic declines in recent decades, they are now at real risk of extinction as a breeding bird across Ireland, Wales, and much of lowland England.\u201cIn these areas we are seeing existing populations becoming increasingly isolated, and a lack of breeding success means there is a risk that they are now dominated by ageing and potentially infertile birds. This new research project will therefore inform conservation efforts in these areas by identifying causes of egg failure, and potentially also alerting us to impacts of chemical pollutants and/or poor nutrition on curlew breeding and wintering grounds.\u201cThere was a recent study that basically showed the biggest kind of block for population recovery in the curlew is the early reproductive stages \u2013 the hatching and successful survival of young chicks. Every egg is crucial and every clutch is crucial.\u201d This article was amended on 3 February 2023 to remove an image that was used in error.",

This inaccurate characterisation sowed discord within communities. A lot of people care about our street trees and gave their time and energy to try to protect them for the benefit of the whole city.\u201dThe council accepts it repeatedly gave out misleading information about the 25-year contract it signed with the outsourcing firm Amey.\u201cWe are sorry for developing and adopting a flawed plan and including the aim to replace half of the city\u2019s street trees,\u201d said Hunt and Josephs. \u201cWe would like in particular to apologise for repeatedly saying in the media, and in correspondence, that there was no target for the tree replacement programme, that felling was always a last resort and that any change to the tree replacement programme would result in catastrophic costs. It is clear that this was not the case.\u201dThe pair said the plan involved \u201cthe removal of healthy trees which should still be standing today\u201d.They wrote: \u201cThese healthy trees were important to residents and gave communities and the city benefits which were overlooked. Residents should not have had to fight their council to retain and value healthy trees, particularly not those with special significance such as memorial, rare or veteran trees. We recognise that we got so much of this wrong and we apologise unreservedly.\u201dThe statement offered a special apology to Alison Teal, a former Green councillor. In 2017, the council took her to court for allegedly breaking an injunction that was enforced to stop protesters from protecting the trees from chainsaws. She was ultimately found not guilty.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

She tweeted: \u201cIt outlines the blindness of hubris and the unjust inclination of those with too much power to abuse it. A perfect case study for others to learn from.\u201dThe council accepts that it misled two high court judges via the council\u2019s five-year tree management strategy, which it knew was flawed. \u201cMisleading the courts is a serious matter and we will write to them to apologise,\u201d Hunt and Josephs said.",

Our Birdata monitoring website now has 750 records of the koel in Victoria.\u201dDooley said there were 121 recorded sightings of koels in 2022, according to Birdlife Australia\u2019s latest annual bird count.The \u2018devil bird\u2019 koel, which lays its eggs in other bird\u2019s nests, may be moving south as temperatures increase, researchers say. Photograph: Bikas Das/AP\u201cThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there were 121 birds in the state, as their call is so loud that multiple counters may have heard the same bird,\u201d he said.Michael Clarke, an emeritus professor in zoology at La Trobe University, has been conducting bird surveys at Victoria\u2019s most southerly point, Wilsons Promontory, for 17 years. He says koels, which are a cuckoo species, leave their eggs in the nests of other birds to feed them.\u201cIn 2017 we got the first record of [koels] down there. There\u2019s been another sighting this year \u2026 and that was noteworthy because the host, the red wattlebird, was noticeably abundant in my surveys,\u201d Clarke said.\u201cThe number of sightings are going up and they are being detected more than they were in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are clearly exploring territory that we have never seen before and what\u2019s driving that is really puzzling.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These include the Australian Industry Group, the Investor Group on Climate Change and the Australian Conservation Foundation.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nLast week the Greens called for a national energy transition authority in a Senate inquiry backing their private senator\u2019s bill. The move was rejected by Labor senators on the basis it would duplicate the work of existing agencies.The ACTU, with its 38 affiliated unions and 1.8 million workers, has much greater institutional sway within Labor. The call for an energy transition authority is backed by the mining union and the Electrical Trades Union, both affiliates of the Labor party.According to excerpts of her speech, O\u2019Neil says the authority would \u201csupport the workers at fossil fuel facilities that will phase down in the transition to a net zero carbon future\u201d.\u201cThat means individualised labour adjustment packages to guarantee workers affected by the transition have access to quality, secure, and safe jobs,\u201d she says.\u201cThese should include industrywide pooled redundancy and redeployment schemes, education and training opportunities, income replacement and relocation packages where necessary, and early retirement packages where voluntary and appropriate.\u201dAustralia\u2019s white paper industry is dead, leaving rural communities to pick through the pulpRead moreAccording to O\u2019Neil, the government has \u201cconcluded rightly that it can\u2019t just rely on high carbon industries to reduce their emissions at the pace required by climate science \u2026 That is why we needed legislation\u201d.\u201cLikewise, we cannot rely on these industries to simply do the right thing by their workers when a facility is closing down.\u201d\u201cThe authority has to make sure employers are doing their fair share \u2013 not just turning their back after doling out the bare minimum redundancy payments.\u201dO\u2019Neil\u2019s speech says the authority would also \u201chelp fund robust economic diversification plans for regions transitioning away from fossil fuel industries\u201d and make sure that education and training is in place.Diversification could include \u201cleveraging federal and state incentives and investments to drive new renewable infrastructure into those regions \u2013 whether a factory manufacturing batteries, an electrolyser producing green hydrogen, or a processing plant refining Australian cobalt for export\u201d.The speech notes say some of this work is already occurring \u201cin the absence of federal leadership\u201d and the authority would complement existing work \u201cby conducting analyses of feasibility and comparative advantage only possible at the national level; and by compelling participation from all of the key players, including industry\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has been welcomed by green groups, clean air campaigners and some businesses, although Conservatives have opposed the charge and said most people in outer boroughs do not want it.Khan said the capital\u2019s toxic air, and the climate emergency, made it a public health imperative, and that revenue raised would go into public transport.New ultra-low emission zone mapAnnouncing the decision at Bonus Pastor school in Lewisham, an area with dangerously poor air quality, Khan said: \u201cThe latest evidence shows that air pollution is making us sick from cradle to the grave. Londoners are developing life-changing illnesses such as cancer, lung disease, dementia and asthma. And it\u2019s especially dangerous for children.\u201dHe said the zone, which was expanded from the heart of the city to boroughs within the north and south circular roads last October, had been \u201ctransformational\u201d, reducing harmful pollution levels by almost a half in central London. \u201cExpanding the Ulez London-wide will mean 5 million more people will be able to breathe cleaner air and live healthier lives,\u201d he said.Khan said the rising cost of living was a major consideration and that the \u00a3110m scrappage scheme would help people who most needed it to scrap or retrofit non-compliant vehicles.Alex Williams, Transport for London\u2019s chief customer and strategy officer, said the scheme would offer \u201cunparalleled support\u201d, extending the grace period for some types of vehicles and groups, including disabled people, and offering more free bus passes.He said it would be \u201ccomplemented by significant improvements to the outer London bus network, making public transport a more attractive alternative to the car\u201d.While London has struggled financially, TfL and the mayor say the Ulez expansion is designed to get the most polluting vehicles off the road rather than to raise revenue, with compliance now at 94%.About 15% of vehicles driving in outer London boroughs would currently be liable for the charge \u2013 160,000 cars and 42,000 vans entering the zone daily, according to TfL estimates.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said: \u201cWhen we had the inquest, we got the experts in Ella\u2019s case to give some recommendations and all of them agreed Ulez expansion was something that needed to be done to clean up the air in London. Clean air should be a human right.\u201dMuniya Barua, the deputy chief executive at BusinessLDN, welcomed the move but said the mayor and TfL\u2019s next step should be to accelerate plans for a smarter road pricing scheme. \u201cWith congestion costing the economy over \u00a35bn a year and a 27% reduction in car miles required to hit our net zero targets, this has to be a priority.\u201dConservatives in the Greater London Assembly condemned the move and warned it could still be stopped by a legal challenge, with about 60% of respondents to the consultation opposed to the expansion.Nick Rogers, the GLA Conservatives\u2019 transport spokesperson, said: \u201cNow is not the time to hammer Londoners with a \u00a312.50 daily cost of living charge.

But in one small corner of the far flung north \u2013 Svalbard \u2013 Rudolph and his friends are thriving.Warmer temperatures are boosting plant growth and giving Svalbard reindeer more time to build up fat reserves; they also appear to be shifting their diets towards \u201cpopsicle-like\u201d grasses that poke up through the ice and snow, data suggests.Smaller and plumper than their Lapplandish cousins, yet boasting impressive antlers nonetheless, Svalbard reindeer inhabit almost all non-glaciated areas of the Svalbard archipelago, which sits just 500 miles (800km) from the North Pole.Like other Arctic regions, Svalbard has experienced thicker snowfall, and more frequent rain-on-snow events \u2013 where rain falls on an existing snowpack and freezes \u2013 in recent years, making it harder for reindeer to dig for food.Reports of mass reindeer starvations in Russia, and declining caribou populations in Canada and Alaska, have also prompted concern for Svalbard\u2019s reindeer. Yet, in the most productive parts of the archipelago, reindeer populations have flourished in recent decades.Two Svalbard reindeer battle for control of a harem. Photograph: Stefano Unterthiner/PATo investigate what might be driving the population increase, Tamara Hiltunen, a doctoral student at the University of Oulu in Finland, and her colleagues turned to annual blood samples collected in late winter as part of a long-term monitoring study. By comparing the proportion of carbon and nitrogen isotopes in these samples, they could infer what kinds of plants the reindeer had been eating in preceding weeks.The research, published in Global Change Biology, suggested that between 1995 and 2012 \u2013 a period marked by the normalisation of rain-on-snow events, increased summer temperatures and a growing reindeer population \u2013 there was a dietary shift away from low-growing mosses and towards grass-like \u201cgraminoid\u201d plants.\u201cThe erect nature of the graminoid stems allows that forage to be available to the animals, even though you might have a centimetre or so of ice,\u201d said Prof Jeffrey Welker at the University of Oulu, who supervised the research. \u201cYou have the equivalent of popsicle sticks, which are nutritious enough that those animals can sustain themselves, even during these stressful periods of winter.\u201dHigher soil temperatures and greater amounts of reindeer droppings and urine falling on the ground are also boosting the growth of graminoids, which may further benefit the Svalbard reindeer.\u201cThis is definitely encouraging news,\u201d said Prof Jaakko Putkonen at the University of North Dakota, whose research previously predicted an increase in Arctic regions affected by rain as the century wears on. \u201cHowever, nature is an endless web of interdependent variables. Some of the upcoming changes may be good to the reindeer and some may be detrimental.\u201cFor example, from Scandinavia there are reports of rain on snow promoting the growth of fungi (eg toxic moulds) under the snowpack due to warmer conditions which has led the reindeer to avoid those areas. They may be trading one challenge for another one.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Events that are happening in one place are not identical to those that are happening in others.\u201dHowever, for Svalbard\u2019s reindeer, the future looks bright \u2013 and the archipelago a promising recruitment ground should Santa need further helpers. Given their diminutive size, though, he may need to invest in a smaller sleigh.\u201cI\u2019m sure they could do it, they just might be a little bit obese,\u201d said Hiltunen. \u201cBut maybe if they lived with Santa, they wouldn\u2019t need so much fat to keep themselves alive.\u201d",

The PM\u2019s focus, and those of cabinet and other ministers and members of government, on claiming the CCC is recommending policies that are unaffordable to the general public. They are clearly not government policy, and can only become policy under this government. When asked where these ideas came from, the response has been that the CCC recommended them.\u201dThe government is in charge of appointing the new chair of the committee, and there are fears among the scientific community that Sunak will choose someone who allows him to weaken the next carbon budgets, or that the prime minister will stoke public distaste for the committee in order to change the carbon budgets in parliament.A spokesperson from No 10 responded by sending comments Sunak made to broadcasters earlier in the week in which he said: \u201cLots of people will have lots of different views on this. We\u2019ve been through the numbers. we\u2019re confident that we are on track to deliver all our targets. And I would point out people have predicted we would miss our carbon budgets in the past, but we\u2019ve actually met every single one of them.\u201d",

Photograph: VeoliaDonald Macphail, the chief operating officer of Veolia\u2019s treatment\u200b\u200b division, said the project would have \u201cminimal ground-level impact\u201d, meaning that \u201cthe wildlife that has repopulated the restored land can continue to coexist with the technology\u201d.There could be hundreds of hectares of closed landfill sites across the UK that could play host to solar arrays, according to Philippe Queruau, the electrification services manager at Veolia UK. In addition, thousands of hectares of active landfill sites could be used for solar arrays in the future.\u201cWe\u2019re just scratching the surface for now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need a lot more solar, and landfills are a prime location.\u201dThe government aims to increase the UK\u2019s existing 14 gigawatts (GW) of solar power capacity fivefold to 70GW by 2035. This would require a project on the scale of Ockendon being installed roughly every five days for the next 12 years.Frank Gordon, the director of policy at the Association for Renewable Energy and Clean Technology, previously known as the Renewable Energy Association, said: \u201cWe urgently need more solar in the UK to help meet our legally binding net zero goals, and this summer\u2019s extraordinary global weather has further underlined the need for climate action.\u201dVeolia is one of many companies installing solar power in urban rooftops such as hospitals and car parks. The company is also exploring the potential for floating solar installations atop water reservoirs as well as solar modules fixed to the top of diesel refuse trucks to help power the bin lifts or air conditioning.The Ockendeon solar farm includes more than 100,000 solar modules covering 70 hectares of land. Photograph: VeoliaThe greatest barrier to the UK\u2019s solar ambitions is the high demand for a connection to the National Grid, which has led to a backlog of applications and a queue with a wait-time of between 10 and 15 years.National Grid\u2019s electricity system operator and the industry regulator have taken steps to address the problem in recent months in an attempt to halve the wait for renewable energy developers to connect to the grid.Queruau said the Ockendon solar farm did not face a lengthy delay for a grid connection \u2013 and will share parts of the grid infrastructure with another major solar farm nearby.",

She took early retirement and relocated from east London to a 47-hectare organic farm near Bath. Swapping the office for rolling hills dotted with grazing sheep, Vickerie now raises animals and manages events on the land for a living.\u201cThe ability to be outdoors and see the seasons coming in is an absolute joy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been so good for my mental health and since I\u2019ve always been a very busy person, I wouldn\u2019t have done retirement well. It\u2019s good that I\u2019ve found another busy job to do.\u201dNot much of Vickerie\u2019s life has gone according to a plan. Growing up in London in the 1970s, she dreamed of training as a vet but was instead encouraged by her headteacher to enrol in teacher training college and soon began working at a secondary school. She then relocated to South America to teach, before returning to London in the 1980s and the world of local educational policy, eventually working her way up to become senior education officer for the borough of Tower Hamlets.\u201cMy philosophy was always to go through the open doors that presented themselves,\u201d the 69-year-old says. \u201cBut I never imagined I\u2019d end up leaving the city altogether for a different life.\u201dHer route to rural living began with romance. With her three children from a previous relationship having flown the nest, Vickerie decided to try online dating and, in 2011, signed up to a match-making site that paired users with high compatibility scores. \u201cI never managed more than a 34% match with anyone until Richard came back with 96%,\u201d she says. \u201cI had been looking for someone who liked jazz and lived in London, while he loved opera and was living on a farm in Somerset, but I had to find out more.\u201dVickerie and Bean. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/The GuardianWhen Vickerie arrived for their date, she felt an immediate chemistry. \u201cHe\u2019s such an interesting person. He\u2019s older than me, now 81, but he\u2019s disgustingly fit \u2013 he used to sail racing yachts in the US when he was younger but he came to the UK and ended up buying a local mill before expanding into this farm,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought he just worked here; I didn\u2019t realise he owned the place.\u201dOver the next five years of travelling from her east London home to visit Richard on the farm, the commute began to take its toll. In 2017, she took the plunge and moved to the country to help run the business full-time. \u201cIt seemed like the right thing to do and I haven\u2019t looked back since,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I was younger I wanted to work with animals and loved events \u2013 now these are the two things I spend all my time doing.\u201dInitially pitching in with the farm\u2019s main business of growing organic vegetables, Vickerie soon brought in a flock of wiltshire horn sheep to graze on the land and provide meat for sale. \u201cWe started off muddling along with 20 sheep and now we\u2019re up to 70 with the help of a brilliant young shepherd called Josh,\u201d she says. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be able to lead a lambing season but the first time I pulled a lamb out of a ewe, I danced around the stables and felt like it was the most wonderful moment of my life.\u201dWhile the farm is a perfect fit for this stage of Vickerie\u2019s life, she is open about the challenges running a business can have on a relationship. \u201cWe can be polar opposites sometimes, but we compromise and Richard has taught me to slow down,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re also both getting older, so we\u2019ve recently begun letting other people take over spaces and parts of the business.\u201dThe couple have a long-term plan to place the farm into a trust so that it can continue to be run by people with a passion for organic produce. Until then, there is plenty more work to be done and Vickerie is relishing every opportunity.\u201cThis move has been a life-saver,\u201d she says. \u201cI needed a new challenge and I haven\u2019t regretted it at all.\u201d Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?",

I just hope people are smart enough not to do it. There are much safer ways to get just as much attention.\u201dThe managing director of Silverstone, Stuart Pringle, was equally blunt in his statement that protesters such as the Just Stop Oil group that have targeted sporting events, such as the Ashes Test at Lord\u2019s, the Premiership rugby final and the World Snooker Championship, would be taking a severe risk in attempting similar actions at the race this weekend.\u201cYou are not putting your life in danger when you sit on a snooker table or protest at a flower show,\u201d Pringle said. \u201cA motor racing track is not the place to go. It is extraordinarily dangerous and people will be putting lives at risk if they go there, and any sensible, right-thinking person can extrapolate what the ultimate risk here is. My strong, strong message is: \u2018Do not put your life in danger. This is not the place to go and sit on a floor\u2019. It is absolute madness if someone climbs on to a live racing track.\u201dThe British GP is one of the biggest sporting events of the year and last year attracted Formula One\u2019s largest global attendance. This year 480,000 are expected to attend over the weekend, with 140,000 on race day. It garners enormous attention both in the UK and globally and has been targeted by protesters before.Just Stop Oil climate change protesters during a track invasion at Silverstone in 2022.

There were large queues on the opening day of Wimbledon as the tournament increased security in an attempt to deter Just Stop Oil protesters, including bag searches for cable ties, glue, chains and padlocks.The problem Silverstone faces is that protesters do not have to attach themselves to anything to make a statement but rather just invade the track like last year.

Until the late 1960s it was thought that whale noises were nothing more than expressive sounds or calls. But in 1967, a discovery by the marine biologist Roger Payne, who died last Saturday, changed our understanding \u2013 ushering in a new way of looking at the world\u2019s largest mammals.As the young Payne listened on repeat for days to recordings made of humpback sounds captured underwater off the coast of Bermuda, he noticed the calls were organised in repeating patterns. Speaking to Guardian Seascape in 2020, he described it as his \u201cwow\u201d moment, spurring on the discovery \u2013 made alongside other researchers \u2013 that all whale species \u201csing\u201d in some rhythmic form, even in the \u201cclicks\u201d of toothed whales, such as sperm whales.00:01:06Sound of a solo whale captured underwater \u2013 audioSome whales even use the sonata form, common to human music: a theme, followed by a variation, then a return to the theme. The zoologist Katy Payne \u2013 Roger\u2019s collaborator (and former wife) \u2013 would go on to prove that whales use what can be described as rhyme, a technique whales seem to use to remember long and complex sections of repeating patterns, topped and tailed with \u201cend phrases\u201d.Katy Payne showed humpback whales in a given area sing different versions of the same song \u2013 essentially a \u201chit\u201d \u2013 that changes slightly throughout the course of the season. Indeed, it was the humpback \u2013 toothless baleen whales, with fleshy, concertina-like jaws \u2013 that quickly stood out as the most prolific cetacean singer, creating songs that are also emotionally affecting to human beings.00:01:06Sound of distant whale captured underwater \u2013 audioWhy whales sing is still not comprehensively clear, but Roger Payne soon observed differences between their songs and their other social sounds: for example, between the \u201calmost whispering\u201d tone of mothers communicating to calves, and the long, loud broadcasts of males seeking a mate.Roger Payne, conservationist and popularizer of whale song, dies age 88Read moreIt is primarily males that sing songs, though there are some recordings of females singing, too. The role of whale song in mating is still not fully understood. In 2020 Stanford University researchers found that blue whales sing at different times of day and night as their migration behaviour changes \u2013 though, again, precisely why is unclear.00:01:06Sound of three whales captured underwater \u2013 audioWhat is known is that, given the distances whales travel in deep ocean, the volume and \u201cbroadcast\u201d quality of song is key. Roger Payne\u2019s assertion, early in his career, that a blue whale, in deep ocean free from human noise pollution, could transmit a song that might be heard by another whale as far as 13,000 miles away, was so controversial among biologists that he described the reaction as almost \u201ccareer-ending\u201d. Another theory of his was that music might predate human life, given that whales predate humans in evolutionary terms.In his later years, Payne became interested in how technology might help to decipher a vocabulary of \u201cwhale speak\u201d, if enough samples could be gathered \u2013 though he stopped short of using the term \u201clanguage\u201d as it was too open to being misconstrued.",

Higher temperatures have also been linked to lower hatchling success rates.In a \u201cdoomsday scenario\u201d, said study co-author Prof Graeme Hays, \u201cthere may be only females being produced from certain populations, which obviously would then lead to population extinction\u201d.Previous research has linked warmer seas to overwhelmingly female green sea turtle populations in parts of the Great Barrier Reef. A 2018 study found that females accounted for 99.1% of juvenile turtles originating from nesting beaches in the north of the reef.Hays emphasised the new research wasn\u2019t \u201call doom and gloom\u201d, but highlighted the potential need for conservation strategies to cool the temperatures at nesting beaches.\u201cThere\u2019s lots of good news going on around the world with sea turtles,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a number of sites around the world, populations are going up; conservation is working really successfully.\u201cWith the climate warming feminisation [research], what we\u2019re trying to do now is to get the information so that we can prevent problems down the line \u2026 [so] if turtles do need help down the track, we\u2019re not caught off-guard.\u201dSea turtles tend to nest in the area they hatched from, a behaviour known as natal philopatry. It means, the researchers suggest, that they \u201ccannot readily change their range to accommodate warming temperatures\u201d.The study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, used a projected 1.5C increase in sea temperatures, \u201cas this warming is very likely to happen before the end of the century\u201d.It was also based on existing research showing that warming temperatures can result in earlier nesting. A study on loggerhead turtles in the Mediterranean had previously found that in extreme cases turtles laid eggs about 18 days earlier when waters warmed by 1C.Christine Madden Hof, the global marine turtle conservation lead at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), said: \u201cWe need more data to understand how the different species of marine turtles in different localities around the world are going to fare in the face of climate change.More than 1.1m sea turtles illegally killed over past 30 years, study findsRead more\u201cWhere we know those populations aren\u2019t going to fare well, we should be really seriously considering scientifically based [interventions].\u201dWWF is a collaborator on trials that have successfully used seawater and freshwater to artificially cool turtle nests.Increasing shade cover on beaches using marquees or by planting vegetation has also been suggested as an approach that could improve sex ratios. It would require care to ensure that nesting habitats were not disrupted, Hays said.\u201cYou\u2019re playing god when you put an intervention in place,\u201d Hof said. \u201cIt might be that a really cool rainy year or number of years might produce enough males to sustain the population, so we don\u2019t want to intervene when it\u2019s not necessary.\u201dWWF is also currently investigating how many male turtles are needed at a minimum to sustain populations.Of the seven living marine turtle species, six are included on the International Union for Conservation of Nature red list of threatened species.",

A closeup image shows the fungus wrapped around the body of a trapdoor spider, poking out of the burrow from which the arachnid grabs insects.Researchers said there was no evidence that the new parasitic fungus controlled the behaviour of trapdoor spiders before killing them, like their zombie-ant fungi relatives, which overcome the insects and trick them into leaving their nests to go to places where they can spread their spores and have been made famous by the post-apocalyptic TV drama The Last of Us.\u2018A really beautiful thing\u2019: the purple fungus infects and kills the spiders. Photograph: Jo\u00e3o Ara\u00fajoThe fungus was found in November during a field trip to forests north of Rio de Janeiro to document the area\u2019s biodiversity and search for new species. It will need a formal scientific description before it is confirmed as a new species.\u201cIt\u2019s a really beautiful thing,\u201d said Dr Jo\u00e3o Ara\u00fajo, a Brazilian mycologist with the New York Botanical Garden, who made the discovery but has not yet decided on a name. \u201cThey infect trapdoor spiders, and it\u2019s one of the very few cordyceps that are purple, which is a cool feature.\u201cWe don\u2019t know much about this fungal group because it\u2019s very understudied. This kind of fungus has been collected very few times in the world, mostly in Thailand. This will likely be the first time we sequence a species like this from Brazil.\u201dThe Atlantic rainforest is one of the most threatened ecosystems in the world. It once covered 15% of Brazil but has become highly fragmented, with only 20% of the original area now left. A biodiversity hotspot, it boasts several species that are found nowhere else on Earth, including the golden lion tamarin monkey and the painted tree rat.The expedition, which was a collaboration between Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, the New York Botanical Garden, Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden and other organisations, included experts on plants, fungi, frogs, snakes and birds who wanted to see what remained in the forest. Scientists used the latest portable technology to sequence the genome of the fungus on site.Another potentially new parasitic fungus on a harvestman spider.

Auckland airport reported 249mm of rainfall in a 24-hour period on 27 January, with a month\u2019s worth of rainfall in less than an hour. At another station, Albert Park, there was 280mm in one day, with 211mm falling in less than six hours.These totals are more than 8.5 times higher than a typical January, and more than 2.5 times higher than an entire typical summer. Overall, Auckland has had the wettest January since records began, with more than half a metre of rain falling in places. The rainfall has caused numerous landslips, flooding and damage to roads and properties with four people killed and 350 in need of emergency accommodation. More than 9,000 people are still stranded as flights in and out of Auckland experiencing delays and cancellations.Last weekend in the US, a strong cold front progressed southward into Texas, with sites in Oklahoma recording a 10-20F drop in temperature within an hour. Cold air lingered at and near the surface in the Southern Plains into this week, but south-westerly flow at higher altitudes advected warmer air over the top of this shallow cold layer.This combination helped produce freezing rain, a phenomenon where rain becomes supercooled through the cold surface layer, landing and turning to ice as it hits any surfaces. The freezing rain coated roads and weighed down trees with a glazing of ice, causing many road accidents. Where the cold layer was slightly deeper, the droplets froze into ice pellets, with \u201cthundersleet\u201d observed in Dallas, Texas earlier this week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I\u2019m hopeful more progress can be made.\u201dA report from Debt Service Watch, a coalition of debt campaign groups, said the outlook for developing countries was worse than during the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s and during the two rounds of multilateral debt relief in the late 90s and mid-2000s.Debt service was absorbing 54% of budget revenue and 40% of public spending in Africa, the report said. Spread across all continents, 35 countries were paying more than half of their revenue servicing their debts, and 54 over one-third.The figures were more than twice the levels faced by low-income countries before the heavily indebted poor country initiative of the 1990s and the multilateral debt relief initiative of 2005; and slightly higher than those paid by Latin American countries in the 80s.According to the Debt Service Watch report the five countries with the highest debt servicing costs as a share of revenue are Egypt, on 196%, Sierra Leone (169%), The Gambia (165%), S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe (137%) and Malawi (133%).Four countries \u2013 Chad, Zambia, Ethiopia and Ghana \u2013 have applied for debt relief through the common framework.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Current debt relief deals were failing to provide poor countries with the scope to spend more on achieving the UN 2030 sustainable development goals, with the latest restructuring deals leaving debt service at an average 48% of revenue over the next three to five years.\u201cThe international community must take urgent steps to reduce debt service much more sharply, through enhanced debt relief and reduced borrowing costs,\u201d the report said.Matthew Martin, the director of Development Finance International, said: \u201cThis is a silent crisis.

The script is, essentially, a cri de coeur, staged with footage of endangered flora and animal life. This is affecting in itself but the lessons are too brief and basic.

Although Italy and Poland oppose the law and Bulgaria is abstaining, it is expected to be approved by a majority of EU countries on Tuesday.The row blew up after Germany\u2019s Free Democratic party, a member of the three-way governing coalition, withdrew support from an EU plan to ban the sale of new cars powered by internal combustion from 2035 without stronger guarantees for e-fuels.After going back on a deal agreed between EU ministers and the European parliament last October, the German government secured further concessions over the future use of e-fuels, which are not yet commercially available.Germany\u2019s transport minister, Volker Wissing, said: \u201cVehicles with internal combustion engines can still be newly registered after 2035 if they fill up exclusively with CO2-neutral fuels.\u201dThe European Commission vice-president, Frans Timmermans, tweeted that after the agreement with Germany, the commission would follow up \u201cswiftly with the necessary legal steps\u201d to implement what had been agreed and get the regulation adopted \u201cas swiftly as possible\u201d.The dispute was a sign of growing tensions about the EU\u2019s green deal, a set of laws intended to ensure Europe achieves net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Berlin\u2019s U-turn on a done deal also triggered concerns among some countries of copycat behaviour that would undermine EU decision-making.The pro-business FDP\u2019s last-minute revolt reflected concerns in the powerful German car industry among companies that have specialised in manufacturing parts unique to combustion engines such as exhaust pipes.E-fuels, which can be made from captured carbon dioxide and hydrogen, or the chemical or thermal treatment of biofuels or biomass, are thought likely to remain scarce for years to come.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They are known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down, and they have been linked to cancer, high cholesterol, liver disease, kidney disease, fetal complications and other serious health problems.The new study analyzed data from three studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at different periods since 2013.The EPA found all but one of the 501 samples it checked had elevated PFAS levels. Farmed freshwater fish typically had significantly lower levels of PFAS than wild caught, which David Andrews, one of the study\u2019s coauthors, said might be due to farms using groundwater as a source to fill ponds instead of contaminated rivers or lakes.The highest levels were found in several species of bass and catfish, while the lowest relative levels were found in chinook and coho salmon. Fish caught near urban areas typically had higher levels.Investors pressure top firms to halt production of toxic \u2018forever chemicals\u2019Read moreThe FDA tested commercially caught fish bought at grocery stores. The median levels of PFAS detected in wild caught fish from streams and rivers were 280 times higher than those sold in grocery stores.The study\u2019s authors note the issue represents an especially challenging problem for low income residents who cannot afford to buy fish from stores, or groups that fish for cultural practices.Despite the findings, the EPA and the FDA have not warned consumers or those fishing about the dangers of eating what they catch. Fish advisories are typically issued at the state level and differ across the country, and most are based on outdated EPA health advisories that allow much higher levels of chemicals than do the revised levels issued this year.The situation is \u201cfrustrating because there\u2019s no clear solution\u201d beyond eliminating any further sources of PFAS pollution, Andrews said. Lakes that don\u2019t regularly turn over water could be contaminated for decades, he added.\u201cI don\u2019t want to tell people not to fish because I love fishing, but I would recommend, if at all possible, to avoid consuming freshwater fish unless you have clear information that it\u2019s not contaminated, because this study indicates nationwide contamination of freshwater fish,\u201d Andrews said.",

        "text": "For the first time ever, the executives from four major oil companies and two of the industry\u2019s most powerful front groups testified before Congress about their decades-long effort to spread climate disinformation and block legislation that would reduce US dependence on fossil fuels.Republicans vehemently opposed the premise of Thursday\u2019s House oversight hearing. Yet within the first round of GOP questioning, led by one of the industry\u2019s staunchest defenders, ranking committee member James Comer of Kentucky, the executives inadvertently proved why they were summoned to testify under oath in the first place.Comer asked each oil executive if they had \u201cever approved a disinformation campaign\u201d. Then, one after another, the heads of Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP all repeated that no, they had never approved any such effort.Here\u2019s the problem: that\u2019s a lie.There can be no doubt that Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP have all engaged in false advertising, aka disinformation campaigns, during the tenure of their current CEOs. In fact, one could argue that the vast majority of the industry\u2019s advertising fits this definition.Take Exxon. For years, Exxon has been spending millions of dollars to run ads about its investments in algae fuel, even though it has spent very little on the actual research and has no plan to bring the product to market. The company hopes to create a \u201cnet impression\u201d among consumers that Exxon is in the business of climate solutions, when it\u2019s really still in the business of climate destruction. It\u2019s textbook false advertising \u2013 which is one reason Exxon is being taken to court for this disinformation.Or look at Chevron. In the 2020 ad \u201cButterfly,\u201d Chevron highlighted its commitment to carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) as a climate solution. According to the New York Times, however, Chevron is only spending \u201cpocket change\u201d on these technologies as it \u201cdoubles down\u201d on oil and gas production. Worse yet: the technology Chevron is touting doesn\u2019t actually work. Chevron\u2019s largest CCS project in Australia has been \u201ca disaster from the beginning\u201d and is now just venting CO2 into the atmosphere.Shell provides a company-wide example. Over the last year, Shell has touted its new net zero commitment as evidence that the company is committed to climate action. Company documents, however, say, \u201cShell\u2019s operating plans and budgets do not reflect Shell\u2019s Net-Zero Emissions target.\u201d Translation: our advertising is false.Finally, BP. The company that once tried to rebrand itself \u201cBeyond Petroleum\u201d, faced legal complaints in 2019 about running false advertising in the UK that misled the public about the company\u2019s commitment to renewable energy.Those are just a few of the more recent examples from decades\u2019 worth of disinformation that big oil companies and their front groups have been pumping into our information ecosystem. As the journalists Molly Taft and Emily Atkin wrote recently, this disinformation campaign played out around the hearing itself: in the days leading up to the event, the top energy and climate newsletters in DC were all inundated with big oil advertisements touting the companies\u2019 supposed climate commitments.Americans can assume these CEOs are lying about their company\u2019s practices, but in order to really hold them accountable, we need documents that show that lie in clear, black ink.That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that at the end of Thursday\u2019s hearing, committee chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said that she would issue subpoenas to get more documents out of the oil companies and their front groups. Whether we get the evidence via subpoenas or leaks from an industry insider, the truth is likely to come out eventually: big oil has been lying to the public about the damage fossil fuels are doing to the climate, just like big tobacco lied about the damage cigarettes were doing to our health.At Thursday\u2019s hearing, each oil executive said they had never approved a disinformation campaign, even though we can see those campaigns with our very own eyes. Whether that moment becomes as iconic as when the tobacco executives lied about cigarettes is all up to what happens next. Stay tuned.\nJamie Henn is the founder and director of Fossil Free Media, home of the Clean Creatives campaign, which is pressuring advertising and PR firms to stop working with the fossil fuel industry.\n",

Dartmoor was the last place in England or Wales where there was a right to wild camp.Alexander Darwall, a hedge fund manager and Dartmoor\u2019s sixth-largest landowner, brought the case against the national park, arguing that the right had never existed.

There is to be a map on the national park\u2019s website showing visitors where they have permission to camp.Kevin Bishop, the chief executive of Dartmoor National Park Authority, confirmed to the Guardian: \u201cThere will be a transfer of money between the authority and the landowners, it could be as little as a pound but it could be much more, we don\u2019t know yet. Individual wild campers would not have to pay, you wouldn\u2019t have to take your credit card on a wild camping trip, but you would know from the map that would be on our website that you could camp there and the landowner had granted authority.\u201dCampaigners have said this agreement is not good enough as it means only a small portion of Dartmoor will be available for wild camping, when until recently they had access to the whole park.Annie Dare, a wild camping campaigner, said: \u201cThis rolling back of our rights to nature has galvanised thousands of people up and down the country to come together to fight to overturn this ruling: to defend and extend and deepen public access to public land.\u201cWe will not be appeased by the deal announced today, under which any landowner may withdraw permission for wild camping at will; under which we understand wild camping will no longer be free; and under which the public would have access to a much smaller area of our beloved Dartmoor.\u201cWe will not stop until wild camping is free and enshrined in law.\u201dGuy Shrubsole from the Right to Roam campaign referred to the deal as a \u201cstitch-up\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is a ransom note from landowners who will be allowed to revoke permission at any time.

Why the pairing could have huge benefits for wildlife in ScotlandRead moreTo mark its 60th birthday earlier this year, the magazine asked 60 conservationists, writers, presenters and photographers to nominate their favourite UK nature destination, which were voted on by 5,000 participants on its website. Views on the 10 most popular destinations were then canvassed among 2,000 people by YouGov to arrive at the overall winner.One local person, Richard Lafferty, whose company Aquaholics runs diving training and wildlife boat tours from Portstewart, said he wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cThe waters off the north coast here are very rich in marine life because we have quite strong tidal currents and our waters are full of plankton. It feeds the soft corals and the sponges underwater, which bring in the small fish, the birds and the bigger predators like our dolphins, porpoises, whales and basking sharks.\u201dVisitors were often surprised by the abundance of wildlife in the deep, warm Atlantic waters, said Lafferty. \u201cFor years, we\u2019ve been taking people out [who say], \u2018We\u2019ll learn to scuba dive here so when we go abroad, we can do it.\u2019 And then they come back to us after being abroad and they say, \u2018We saw more marine life here.\u2019\u201d Of four trips on Tuesday, three included dolphin sightings, he said, while guests on one trip this week spotted six minke whales.Several stretches of the coastline are owned by the National Trust, which said it was \u201cdelighted to be one of the custodians who help encourage wildlife along the Causeway coast\u201d.The Giant\u2019s Causeway itself is the home of \u201csome very special species, including the pygmy sorrel moth, one of the world\u2019s smallest moths; the northern colletes bee and the black-tailed skimmer dragonfly, as well as the narrow-mouthed whorl snail,\u201d said the trust, adding that stromatolites \u2013 stony structures built by colonies of bacteria that it called \u201cone of the earliest known life forms on Earth\u201d \u2013 were another surprise find at the Unesco world heritage site.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Bird protection campaigners have accused the French government of flouting European regulations after it rescinded a ban on traditional hunting.They accuse ministers of giving in to lobbying by powerful hunting groups to allow the trapping of thousands of birds as part of an \u201cexperimental study\u201d.Most traditional trapping methods were banned in France in 2021 under the threat of fines from the European Commission.The ministry of ecological transition has now temporarily overturned the embargo on two practices: using large nets placed horizontally in the path of birds \u2013 usually attracted by the calls of a caged bird \u2013 and wire or wood traps.The \u201cstudy\u201d began at the start of this month and is due to continue until 20 November. Its stated aim is to establishing whether these methods are selective, with the eventual goal, hunting organisations hope, of allowing them to continue.Hunters are being allowed to catch 6,000 skylarks using pantes (horizontal nets) or matoles (drop cages) in four departments in south-west France and 500 lapwings and 15 golden plovers in the Ardennes in the north-east.Allain Bougrain-Dubourg, the president of the French Bird Protection League (LPO), said: \u201cThis determination to encourage non-selective trapping is unworthy of a country that claims to be a leader in the recovery of biodiversity \u2026 it\u2019s clear the matoles trap a multitude of protected species, and are not selective. Even if the birds are released, they are at best stressed, at worst subjected to mistreatment that is unacceptable in the 21st century.\u201dFrance\u2019s State Council previously outlawed these trapping methods, stating there was \u201ca serious doubt about whether they conform to European legal rules\u201d.The EU has opened proceedings against Malta, which has used the same \u201cexperimental\u201d justification for allowing the trapping of finches, and a court hearing is expected early next year.Yves Verilhac, a former director general of the LPO and lifelong bird protection campaigner, added: \u201cThey have taken the pretext of science for allowing this. It may be only a few thousand birds, but these are species whose numbers are dwindling and these methods have been banned.\u201cWe have reported the government once again to the European court in the hope they will start imposing fines.\u201dVerilhac says allowing the hunters themselves to monitor the \u201cstudy\u201d is akin to \u201cletting the fox oversee the chickens\u201d.\u201cThe hunters know this type of hunting is finished but are fighting to the last to carry on. There is no doubt this \u2018study\u2019 will find the methods selective when we know the nets and cages catch all kinds of birds.\u201dNicolas Rivet, the director general of the National Federation of Hunters (FNC), defended the ban reversal.\u201cThis isn\u2019t about reopening the hunt. The trapping will only happen in three places in each department and will have a time limit. The aim is to objectively establish if these practices are selective,\u201d Rivet told Le Monde.The question of whether these historic hunting methods target specific species or traps birds at random, even protected species, is at the heart of a battle that has divided France for decades.In 2021, European judges gave France a final warning to outlaw the hunting of songbirds using glue sticks, which it did.According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the National Museum for Natural History, the skylark, whose numbers have dropped 20% in 15 years, is \u201csymbolic\u201d of the decline in common birds due to the intensification of farming practices, and in particular the use of pesticides.",

Many are still unable to return home.The strategy contains plans for \u201cimmediate on-ground investigations\u201d at 15 sites across the region, with the goal to provide homes for about 7,800 residents from the areas most affected by the 2022 disasters.The never-ending fallout of the northern rivers floods: \u2018People are just worn down\u2019Read moreA further seven sites have been flagged for medium- to long-term development to support \u201clonger-term community resilience\u201d.While the document does not commit to a timeframe, MPs and mayors have been told the goal would be to see most of the initial plots of land developed by the end of next year.The strategy said the Northern Rivers Reconstruction Corporation would now start detailed investigations and feasibility studies for each of the first 15 sites.The NRRC will look at the types of homes needed in each area, and how to provide housing diversity, including meeting the needs of renters, workers such as teachers and nurses, and social housing.Six of the sites to be developed in the short term are in the Lismore region, with a further four slated for work later on.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe report found about 600 homes were destroyed or severely damaged in the Lismore local government area and proposed that about 2,620 homes could be built in the area at the near-term sites.Byron, Ballina and Tweed shires have been tipped for two developments in the immediate term, with one site each identified in the Richmond Valley, the Clarence Valley and Kyogle.Relevant local and state politicians were briefed on the strategy on Thursday by the head of the NRRC, David Witherdin, before its public release.While there is widespread agreement that the area needs more homes, some have said the plan lacks critical detail and claimed there has so far been insufficient consultation with the affected communities.A mayor who spoke to Guardian Australia on condition of anonymity said they believed the government was being \u201cvery optimistic\u201d with its goals, calling the lack of detail so far provided to councils and the community \u201creally crap\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The money will be used to support feasibility studies, build critical infrastructure and acquire land, rather than build homes \u2013 which the government says would be too costly and see only about 300 properties built.An NRRC spokesperson said community feedback would be an important part of the process that sought to provide relief to those affected by the floods, as well as longer-term housing issues.\u201cThe resilient land program has been designed to complement, not replace, business-as-usual land release and housing development in the region,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAction will continue to be needed to address these complex housing issues.\u201dThe state\u2019s auditor general released a report on Thursday that found the government in 2021-22 spent $1.4bn from a budget of $1.9bn in response to natural disasters. A further $1.1bn was then spent in the second half of 2022.The report also found 36 councils did not identify climate change or natural disasters as a strategic risk, despite 22 of them having at least one natural disaster in 2021-22.",

        "text": "The Conservative chair of the environment select committee has been urged to resign as the Guardian revealed he is also chair of a group endorsing nature policies described by critics as \u201cdestructive and dangerous\u201d.Sir Robert Goodwill, who chairs the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) select committee (Efra), is tasked with holding the environment secretary to account on nature and environmental targets. He became chair of the committee after his predecessor, Neil Parish, resigned after a pornography scandal.However, Goodwill has recently become the chairman of a new rightwing pressure group called Conservative Friends of the Countryside. The group is calling for a range of policies including halting the release of beavers; continuing the burning of peatland; continuing the use of bee-killing neonicotinoid pesticides; and stopping a ban on imports of hunting trophies from endangered animals.Since Boris Johnson stepped down as prime minister, the government has pulled back on a number of nature commitments, including beaver releases and an end to the badger cull, after pressure from backbench MPs. A new ban on the burning of vegetation on deep peat, one of the UK\u2019s most vital carbon sinks, has been criticised by campaigners for including too many loopholes after landowners and backbenchers lobbied for it to be watered down.Members of the Conservative Friends of the Countryside group include Sir Bill Wiggin, MP for North Herefordshire, who has spoken against bans on foxhunting, referring to it as \u201cclass war\u201d; and Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, MP for the Cotswolds and an outspoken shooting campaigner who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on shooting and conservation.Also on the committee are rural PR guru Amanda Anderson, who has long campaigned against a ban on peatland burning; and George Bowyer, who used to run the Fitzwilliam Hunt and chair of a group called Vote-OK, which campaigned for an end to the ban on foxhunting.Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, called for Goodwill to resign from either the group or the committee.She told the Guardian: \u201cThis group is less like friends of the countryside and more like friends of the hunting, shooting and landowning elites. Its destructive and dangerous list of policies will poison agriculture, threaten animal protection and pollute our planet.\u201cI\u2019m appalled that the chair of the Efra select committee, who has an essential role in scrutinising ministers\u2019 and government progress on improving our environment, should be associated with such nature-wrecking policies. If he won\u2019t dissociate himself from this group, he shouldn\u2019t be associated with the select committee.\u201dSome nature-friendly Conservatives are opposing the aims of the new group. Lorraine Platt, who runs the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation, said: \u201cConservative Animal Welfare Foundation does not support objectives such as stopping beaver releases, keeping peat burning, and keeping trophy hunting imports, which we believe all have the potential to damage rather than protect our environment and animals.\u201cWe support the Conservative government\u2019s 2019 manifesto, which includes several world-leading measures on animal welfare and which includes an end to trophy hunting imports.\u201dNature charities have also criticised the group. Beccy Speight, the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, said: \u201cDecision makers in Westminster cannot afford to ignore the tens of millions of nature lovers in the UK who are calling for urgent action to address this loss, or the scientific evidence of its own advisers making the case for stronger environmental protections. Both will be required to hit the targets set in law by the government to halt declines and set about the vital restoration of our natural world.\u201dGoodwill said there was no issue with chairing the select committee and the campaign group, explaining: \u201cMy committee is a cross-party committee. People take different views on things \u2013 it\u2019s different to being in the cabinet, where you have collective responsibility.\u201dHe added that the group sought to improve the environment \u201cbased on decades of practical experience managing the countryside. The issues we are looking at is about being a friend of the countryside, not an enemy of the countryside, and we don\u2019t want to inadvertently damage the countryside with ill-advised government policies. Sometimes the Greens, whether deliberately or not, fail to understand the means of managing the countryside that is beneficial for threatened species.\u201dGoodwill added that burning the vegetation on peat creates an important heather moorland habitat for endangered birds, and prevents wildfires that can spread and burn down into the deep peat, which should be protected as a carbon store. He also said he did not have a problem with beaver releases but there needed to be a management plan in place, offering the means to remove beavers causing flooding, and compensation schemes for farmers.\u201cOur worry is that people may introduce beavers that may escape and there is no management plan if they start to cause problems,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "There is no evidence schemes that try to limit \u201crat-running\u201d traffic along residential streets disproportionately benefit better-off households, research has concluded, contradicting a common view cited by objectors.A study of low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), which have mushroomed as part of efforts to boost walking and cycling amid coronavirus, found that the vast majority of people lived on streets that could be part of such schemes.There was minimal difference on the likelihood of this for households on lower incomes, people from minority ethnic groups, or those with disabilities, said the report, which found \u201cno clear social equity problem related to LTNs\u201d.The report focused on London, where schemes to filter through traffic from residential streets have existed for decades, but which saw a rush of more than 70 LTNs created across various boroughs between March and September. A number of other cities around the UK, including Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester and Bristol, have introduced or are discussing LTNs.A number of these have proved controversial, with critics arguing that filtering residential streets simply pushes traffic elsewhere, notably on to main roads and high streets, forcing congestion, noise, pollution and danger towards poorer residents.The study, by Prof Rachel Aldred and Dr Ersilia Verlinghieri from Westminster University\u2019s Active Travel Academy with climate charity Possible, stresses, however, that measures should be taken to alleviate traffic flow on bigger roads.Q&AWhat is a low-traffic neighbourhood (LTN)?ShowIn essence, low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) are residential roads in which bollards, planters or strategic \u201cpoint closures\u201d allow vehicle access to all addresses in a neighbourhood but reduce through traffic. Along with vehicle barriers, pavement widening and other measures are also often introduced. This is intended to make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists as well as reduce air and noise pollution.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But it notes that across London about 90% of people live on residential streets, with few disparities across demographic differences such as income, age, ethnic background, disability and access to a car. At least 87% of people from each group lived on a residential street.The authors said: \u201cInterventions in general that improve all residential streets within an area should benefit most people living there in each demographic category.\u201dIn mapping the location of LTNs installed across London during the pandemic, the report found they have disproportionately benefited people in lower-income boroughs, such as Lambeth, Hackney and Islington, with fewer set up in wealthier areas.Hirra Khan Adeogun, senior campaigner at Possible, said: \u201cMuch of the controversy around low traffic neighbourhoods is based on the false perception that they only benefit wealthy people living in residential areas. This report not only busts that myth but shows that in fact 9 in 10 Londoners could benefit from these measures - with those living in poorer neighbourhoods first in line.\u201dThe authors also reject another common objection to LTNs and similar schemes that try to nudge people away from short car journeys to other transport means \u2013 that all they do is move congestion to neighbouring streets.Walthamstow, in north London, introduced an early incarnation of LTNs in 2014, and while vehicle traffic reduced on streets within the scheme, it rose on boundary roads. However, the new study compared this growth to more general traffic variations, finding it did not seem beyond normal patterns.'I got it wrong. Since the changes it's become more vibrant': life in an LTNRead moreLondon has seen a series of protests by some local residents against LTNs, with a handful of boroughs reacting by amending or scrapping their schemes in response.But the Department for Transport, which last week released an extra \u00a3175m for councils to create LTNs, cycle lanes and other interventions, is pointing local authorities to polls suggesting such plans tend to be popular with the majority of people.Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has written to councils receiving new grants about the need for consultation on LTNs, while stressing this should involve objective polling rather than \u201clistening only to the loudest voices or giving any one group a veto\u201d.He wrote: \u201cVery few changes to anything will command unanimous support, and we do not ask it for these schemes. But there is clear evidence that for all the controversy they can sometimes cause, ambitious cycling and walking schemes have significant, if quieter, majority support.\u201dThe report\u2019s authors make a series of recommendations, including that boroughs without LTNs introduce them, especially ones with high levels of deprivation. They also say that more needs to be done by boroughs in outer London.Aldred said: \u201cThe report shows us that the large majority of Londoners, whatever their age, ethnicity, or income level, live on residential streets.\u201cThis is, of course, not an argument for forgetting the one in 10 who live on high streets and main roads, but it does highlight the wide reach of low-traffic neighbourhoods, which are most easily introduced in residential streets.\u201d",

In June, a US district court ruled in favor of the youth plaintiffs, allowing that their claims can be decided at trial in open court; a trial date has yet to be announced.The Juliana case names an array of government actors as defendants, including the president and several other agencies and officials.

        "text": "Coastal nations and conservation groups have described an agreement to restrict fishing vessels from using devices that contribute to overfishing as a \u201chuge win\u201d for tuna populations and marine life.The adoption by fishing nations of tough proposals to restrict \u201cfish aggregating devices\u201d (FADs) in the Indian Ocean, follows warnings to EU officials from retailers, including Marks & Spencer, environmentalists and coastal nations that the tools are one of the main contributors to overfishing of Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna, because they catch high numbers of juveniles.FADs have a \u201chigh environmental cost\u201d they said, because endangered turtles, sharks and marine mammals are often caught when the devices are encircled in the purse seine nets of large tuna vessels. Lost or discarded FADs can also cause environmental damage.Greenpeace\u2019s Arctic Sunrise boat retrieves a fish aggregating device from the Indian Ocean. Photograph: Laurel Chor/GreenpeaceAt a tense three-day meeting of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) over the weekend to discuss the issue, a last-minute proposal to reduce the number of free floating or \u201cdrifting\u201d FADs used by EU and other purse seine fleets, was put forward by Indonesia and 10 other coastal states. It was adopted by a two-thirds majority after a secret ballot on Sunday. The unusual move followed a surprise withdrawal of its proposal by Kenya, then the lead proponent of a temporary FAD ban, which was backed by 10 other African and Asian coastal states.Measures to be adopted by IOTC nations by 1 January 2024, include a phased reduction of the number of drifting FADs for each vessel, a mandatory FAD register, to increase transparency and monitoring of the devices and, for the first time and most controversially, a 72-day period where FADS are banned.The closure period received the most opposition from the EU, who threatened to object to the entire proposal and said on Tuesday they were still considering options.An EU commission spokesperson said they were \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the results of the IOTC meeting. The EU share the aims of the proper management of FADs, the spokesperson said, and had submitted a proposal, which had a \u201cstrong scientific\u201d and practical basis, to reduce their use.\u201cWe were looking forward to a constructive discussion,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cUnfortunately the IOTC meeting did not allow for that. Instead, it adopted, without consensus, a measure that according to our assessment lacks scientific basis and that could prove impossible to implement, in addition to having extremely harsh impacts on fishers and local communities.\u201cWe now need to consider our options. We are determined to make sure the IOTC becomes effective once again.\u201dAlthough the Indian Ocean is bordered by Africa, Asia and Australia, the single biggest harvester of overfished yellowfin \u2013 and indeed all tropical tuna over the past three years \u2013 is the EU. A distant-water fleet of EU vessels, mainly Spanish- and French-owned, harvested 243,001 tonnes in 2021, according to IOTC data.M&S joins calls for EU to restrict harmful tuna fishing methods in Indian OceanRead moreCoastal states, the International Pole and Line Foundation and Blue Marine Foundation said the last-minute proposal would curb the harmful effects of FADs on tuna stocks, endangered species and the marine environment. About 97% of the yellowfin tuna caught around drifting FADS in the Indian Ocean are juveniles, according to the Global Tuna Alliance.The organisation urged all IOTC states, including the EU, to abide by the measures.Adam Ziyad, director general of the Maldives fisheries ministry, described the proposal as a \u201cmajor milestone\u201d for fish populations. Ziyad, who is also vice-chair of the IOTC, said: \u201cI\u2019m happy at the outcome, particularly because of the FAD closure measures. The IOTC is the only tuna RFMO (regulatory body for fisheries) without a closure policy so the 72 days will hopefully allow the stocks to recover.\u201dJess Rattle, head of investigations at Blue Marine, said: \u201cThis landmark decision has been three years in the making and is a giant step forward for the conservation of tuna stocks in the Indian Ocean.\u201cIn the face of immense pressure and opposition from powerful actors from the EU, the 11 coastal states and the other supporters of the drifting FAD measure showed true leadership and dedication to protecting the Indian Ocean\u2019s tuna stocks and the countless coastal communities that depend on them.\u201d",

In terms of animals, we keep them as pets, we eat them, we wear clothes made from them, we use them to make vaccines in laboratories \u2013 and we put them on display for entertainment.This was taken in Blijdorp zoo in Rotterdam. There are two polar bears, one to the right and one to the left. They are siblings, named Sizzel and Todz, who used to live with their mother at the zoo. The space is arranged like a theatre. It\u2019s rare for polar bear enclosures to have a dedicated viewing area like this. The window has a history: one bear, Vicks, the older brother of Sizzel and Todz, broke it by hitting it with a rock.This wasn\u2019t the first time I tried to take this picture. I\u2019d been to the location before, in 2014, but wasn\u2019t satisfied with the result. Two years later, I tried again. I stood in this theatre and waited for half a day. Usually, the bears are resting or playing somewhere else in the enclosure. But here there was a moment of theatre, because it was a feeding session, which is a show in itself. The people are watching the bear and the bear is looking back. The little boy in the bottom right balances the image. The photo, and the White Bear series that it\u2019s part of, asks: \u201cWhat brings us here? What brings us to the point where we, as a species, are viewing wildlife behind glass windows? What is the purpose of these animals being in captivity?\u201dPolar bears have become a powerful symbol of the climate crisis. When looking at this photo, viewers often think about that \u2013 and contemplate the role of zoos and aquariums as \u201clast resorts\u201d for a species\u2019 survival. It\u2019s not for me to say if this climate crisis connection adds poignancy to the image. I don\u2019t wish to exploit that symbolism. My humble project aims primarily to explore the potential problems of zoos, such as poorly designed enclosures, lack of space and boredom among the animals. Zoos can play a crucial role in conservation, but no zoo is perfect.I don\u2019t think Sizzel and Todz live in this enclosure any more. They were pretty young when I took this, maybe one or two years old. Young polar bears in zoos usually display playful behaviour. But the older they grow, the more monotonous their life seems to be. Beyond the human-animal relationships, the general point I\u2019m trying to make is that it\u2019s very difficult for me to remind myself that I am a human being. We take our \u201cspecieshood\u201d for granted. We live every day as humans, but we don\u2019t tend to think about it. We don\u2019t wake up and say: \u201cThis is a nice day and I am a human.\u201d But it\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted, because we have so much power to influence the other species in the world.I wouldn\u2019t want to impose my feelings on an animal in an enclosure. If I take a so-called sad image of such an animal, it\u2019s just one picture. Another photographer could take a happy image of the same animal. Here, I just wanted to show a moment of awkwardness. My work is not about reaching a super-wide audience or influencing society. If the project resonates with one person, that\u2019s good enough for me.

This area, spanning around 250,000 sq miles, is critical as a water resource for cities, cropland and wildlife but has withered under the region\u2019s worst drought in at least 1,200 years.A new hydrological model developed for the new study shows that warming temperatures \u2013 the basin is 1.5C (2.7F) hotter on average than it was in 1880 \u2013 has led to a 10.3% reduction in water runoff. Parts of the basin that are usually snow-covered in winter, which builds up vital snowpack that then melts and nourishes the river in springtime, are losing water at twice the rate of snowless regions, suggesting the Rocky Mountain west is shifting to a more arid state rather than experiencing a mere prolonged drought, Bass said.Rising global heat is responsible, in total, for 10tn gallons (or about 40tn liters) of water to be lost from the Colorado River system since 2000, the study concluded. This is enough to fill the entire Lake Mead, which has hit record-low levels due to the drought, or 15bn Olympic swimming pools.The deal struck between California, Nevada and Arizona in May brought a temporary reprieve to the growing crisis around the Colorado River, as did the torrential bursts of rainfall and snowfall over winter that helped replenish many reservoirs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A major marine heatwave had damaged the kelp and a \u201csea star wasting syndrome\u201d killed the urchins\u2019 main predator, sunflower sea stars.Could they be eaten by us or by otters?

Only buses that are zero-emission will be allowed within the city when the entire fleet is operational, with more restrictions on other types of traffic to cut congestion as well as improve air quality.Just over half the money for the \u00a382.5m scheme has come from Go-Ahead and Stagecoach, who put in \u00a343.7m to buy the vehicles, with the rest from the council and government. Oxfordshire county council received a \u00a332.8m grant from the Department for Transport\u2019s \u00a3500m Zebra scheme to fund zero-emission buses.The partnership, in which both Go-Ahead and Stagecoach electric buses will be rebranded in the same livery, will be underpinned by further traffic measures in the city to reduce bus journey times by at least 10% compared with 2019 speeds \u2013 a contractual commitment from the council to ensure the investment is viable for the private companies.The city already has a number of \u201cbus gates\u201d, which prohibit most other vehicles, and more traffic filters will be introduced by the end of 2024 to push people towards public transport or active travel where possible.Oxford has already implemented several low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), which have been the focus of heated protests by campaigners and conspiracy theorists.So far, increased traffic on the edge of LTNs has slightly slowed bus speeds in the city, according to Luke Marion, managing director of the Go-Ahead-owned Oxford Bus Company, who said the company nevertheless supports the zones as a \u201ckey part of the jigsaw\u201d. Accompanying measures to cut traffic had been delayed, partly because of major roadworks, he said, but \u201conce the traffic filters come in, that will cease to be such a problem.\u201dOxford Bus Company, which will provide 104 of the 159 mostly double-decker electric buses, has installed a charging hub at its Cowley House depot that provides enough electricity to charge its entire fleet to drive 170 miles daily.Electric buses are already running for students. Photograph: GoAheadThe first of its electric buses, serving Oxford Brookes University, are already on the roads but Marion described Monday\u2019s launch as a \u201chistoric moment in our journey towards transforming our city services to electric\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After two weeks of lockdown, there was a dramatic increase in bird-related searches.These increases were seen in data from 115 countries spanning six continents. The lead author, Darryl Jones, professor of ecology at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, said the study was the first to investigate interest in bird feeding on a global scale.\u201cIf bird feeding is common in other parts of the world, this could impact migration and disease patterns,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt is imperative that we understand the global extent of bird feeding in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its potential impacts.\u201dBird feeding, he said, had implications for human as well as bird wellbeing. For people, wild bird feeding is one of the most effective ways to connect with nature\u2013 and connection with nature has consistently been shown to benefit human health.Spending as little as 10 minutes in nature can significantly enhance wellbeing, and exposure to nature has been linked to improved attention, lower stress and reduced risk of anxiety and depression.Bird feeding can be beneficial for the birds, too: it can increase birds\u2019 antioxidant levels, reduce their stress, and contribute to faster feather growth. Human feeding can provide a source of food for birds in times of scarcity that they otherwise may not have survived.However, there are also concerns that feeding wild birds could affect their development. The k\u0101k\u0101, a large species of parrot which was successfully reintroduced to Wellington, New Zealand, could develop bone disease as a result of being overfed with foods containing the wrong nutrients, the researchers warned.Because of its potential impact on migration, bird feeding could also lead to a reshaping of the ecological communities of birds, which could affect biodiversity.The authors also examined the link between interest in bird feeding and biodiversity. They found that in areas where there were more different species of bird, people were more interested in bird feeding.Previously, it was thought that people were poor at quantifying biodiversity. For example, a study from Switzerland found that people overestimated the number of species present in their country by a factor of 30. This new research, however, implies that people have a sense of biodiversity, even if they cannot quantify it.This could have its own implications for human wellbeing. Research has shown that people who have a greater awareness of the different species of birds in their own gardens gain more enjoyment from watching them and feel more connected to nature.The study was published in the journal Plos One.",

They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because most do not degrade in the environment.A 2019 state consent order required Chemours to rein in its Fayetteville Works\u2019 site pollution for PFAS compounds produced or released from the facility. But most PFAS tests can only identify a limited number of PFAS.Chemours, which was spun off from DuPont in 2015 to shield the latter from legal liability, is thought to be responsible for contaminating the air, soil, crops and water across potentially hundreds of square miles of south-east North Carolina with PFAS waste, according to public health advocates, regulators and researchers.Many residents allege it has sickened people on a wide scale; a judge recently allowed more than 100,000 residents to move forward with a class-action PFAS lawsuit against DuPont and Chemours and the United Nations has been urged to investigate alleged human rights violations over the company\u2019s pollution.Researchers identified the PFAS compounds downstream from Fayetteville Works, but did not find them in a lake upstream from the plant, suggesting they were produced by Chemours. Some of the compounds are similar in structure to PFAS produced at Fayetteville Works, but others are highly unusual, Baker said.It is possible that PFAS that have been studied are produced at Fayetteville Works and are turning into new compounds once in the environment.\u201cThat\u2019s where some of the questions come in about whether manufacturers are making things that they know can\u2019t be [detected by current PFAS tests],\u201d Baker said.

They say buds suggest trees will be floriferous with blossom this spring because of the perfect conditions last year for bud formation, and also because early flowering has been prevented by the cold this February.This means the blooming season will be potentially longer lasting. Hopefully the risk of them being \u201cgot at\u201d by frost will lessen as the season progresses, and there will be more fruit as a direct result later in the year.Guy Barter, the chief horticulturist at the RHS, said: \u201cSpring blossom is special each year but this year the light and heat of last summer has promoted a very promising crop of flower buds indeed. These buds had plenty of cold this winter, which they require (officially called the chill factor expressed in hours at about 6C) to \u2018release\u2019 them to flower once spring warms up.\u201cOrnamental cherries, arguably the best of all flowering trees, tough out any spring frosts and are reliably glorious. Apples and other fruit blossom, however, are very vulnerable to late frosts. This cold February means fruit trees won\u2019t flower early. This is good as it means they are more likely to escape any late spring frost that can prevent fruit forming.\u201dSome were concerned the intense heat and drought of last year could have weakened the trees, but they managed to weather it well, perhaps because of their deeper roots. The trees also benefited from extra warmth and light. Other plants with more shallow roots were not so lucky, and some trees, including apple trees, did not have enough \u201cchilling hours\u201d in the early winter, because it was mild in September and October, to produce good fruit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Other tortoises in the area have been seen making similar attacks but no tortoise species has been seen actively pursuing prey in the wild before.The Seychelles giant tortoise is a member of the species Aldabrachelys gigantea, which are \u201cgenerally assumed to be strict herbivores\u201d, according to a study published in Current Biology.Dr Justin Gerlach, the director of studies at Peterhouse, Cambridge, and an affiliated researcher at the University of Cambridge\u2019s Museum of Zoology, led the study. He said: \u201cThis is completely unexpected behaviour and has never been seen before in wild tortoises.\u201dResearchers think this new hunting behaviour has been driven by the unusual combination of a tree-nesting tern colony and a resident giant tortoise population on Seychelles\u2019 Fregate island.Previously all tortoises were thought to be vegetarian \u2013 although they have been spotted feeding opportunistically on carrion, and they eat bones and snail shells for calcium.Extensive habitat restoration on the island has enabled seabirds to recolonise, and there is a colony of 265,000 noddy terns that leave the ground \u201clittered with dropped fish and chicks that have fallen from their nests\u201d.In most places, potential prey are too fast or agile to be caught by giant tortoises. But scientists said the way the Seychelles giant tortoise approached the chick on the log suggested this type of interaction happens frequently. On the Gal\u00e1pagos and Seychelles islands, giant tortoises are the largest herbivores and eat up to 11% of the vegetation.Gerlach said: \u201cThese days, Fregate Island\u2019s combination of tree-nesting terns and giant tortoise populations is unusual. But our observation highlights that when ecosystems are restored, totally unexpected interactions between species may appear \u2013 things that probably happened commonly in the past but we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201dGerlach said the video could be evidence of a \u201cpopulation of tortoises that is developing a new type of behaviour with evolutionary implications\u201d, but added that the revival of seabird and tortoise populations may also have \u201crecreated conditions for natural behaviours that people haven\u2019t seen for hundreds of years\u201d.Naturalist Charles Darwin\u2019s encounters with giant tortoises in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands were key to the development of modern understandings of evolution. After visiting a number of islands in the chain, Darwin realised that each island had its own, distinct species of giant tortoise.Gerlach added: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that they enjoy eating terns. Compared to the ease of eating plants, they\u2019re going to quite a lot of trouble.\u201d",

        "text": "Q&AWhat is PM2.5?ShowPM2.5 particles are those less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. They are invisible to the naked eye and small enough to penetrate deep into our lungs. Exposure to these tiny particles dominates the health harm from air pollution and is the leading environment risk factor for early death.\u00a0PM2.5 comes from the burning of solid and liquid fuels, through power generation, domestic heating and motor traffic. It can also form in the air from chemical reactions between other pollutants.A growing body of research shows that these particulates are responsible for a huge range of health problems from lung and heart disease to diabetes and cancer, brain function to premature births. As well as leaving millions of people with life-limiting chronic health conditions, they also lead to the early death of more than 400,000 people across Europe each year. Experts say more than 200,000 of these could be saved if the air in Europe met World Health Organization guidelines.The current WHO guidelines state that annual average concentrations of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 micrograms a cubic metre (\u00b5g/m3).Gary FullerWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The underlying data for the Guardian\u2019s air pollution in Europe investigation is sourced from the Expanse project, coordinated by the Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, the Netherlands, with air quality modelling conducted in collaboration between Utrecht University and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute.The project employed various data sources, including road data, land use data, satellite air pollution retrievals, chemical transport model estimates and meteorological information, which were employed as input for the air quality modelling. The data, methodology and resulting interactive were shared with air pollution scientist Dr Gary Fuller for verification.To account for the dispersion of air pollution, the researchers calculated several variables within circular buffer sizes ranging from 50 to 10,000 metres. Once the buffered values were determined, all predictor maps were re-gridded to a resolution of 25 metres. Regression analysis was subsequently conducted between these predictors and routine exposure data for NO2 and PM2.5 obtained from the European Environmental Agency (2000 to 2019 inclusive).Population weighting was used to give more weight to air pollution concentrations in highly densely populated areas to better represent population exposures: typically a population-weighted exposure is higher than an average concentration because air pollution tends to be higher in areas where more people reside.The data was aggregated at local administrative unit (LAU) level, geographical units used by the EU with an average of 5,500 residents each, of which there are more than 98,000 across the continent of Europe (excluding Cyprus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Kosovo).A small proportion of European districts not located in Europe (for example, the Canary Islands) are not represented in the data.Certain LAUs have relatively high PM2.5 concentrations despite having very small populations. However, these are usually not caused by primary pollution sources but are secondary, such as by chemical reactions in the atmosphere, or are due to broader regional concentrations.No PM2.5 data was available in a small number of areas, equivalent to less than 1% of the LAUs covered by the data.For the purposes of this exercise we have used the areas\u2019 Latin names but the data is also searchable in non-Latin scripts.The break points used in the interactive are based on a rounded Jenks natural breaks interpolation and are displayed at the following intervals:\n<2.5 \u00b5g/m3\nWHO limit (5 \u00b5g/m3) sourced from here\nEU limit (2030 proposed) (10 \u00b5g/m3) sourced from here( PDF)\nEU limit (current) (25 \u00b5g/m3) sourced from here\nMax value (28 \u00b5g/m3 as per the data)\n Join a free online Guardian Live event on Thursday 28 September, 7pm BST, where the Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent, Jon Henley, will host an interactive discussion with MEPs, leading political scientists and experts, to explore the biggest challenges Europe faces today.

Olympic Park in Melbourne and West Terrace in Adelaide have also seen maximum temperatures among the top 10% ever recorded in recent weeks. All three cities have records stretching back more than 100 years.Temperatures have eased off in parts of Adelaide and Melbourne, but forecasts predict the unseasonably hot weather will return.The Australian Bureau of Meteorology declared on Tuesday that Australia is now in an El Ni\u00f1o climate pattern. El Ni\u00f1o has been linked with increased drought, heatwaves and bushfires in Australia.BoM also confirmed a positive Indian Ocean Dipole \u2013 determined by differences in sea surface temperature between the eastern and western Indian Ocean \u2013 is under way. A positive IOD usually results in decreased spring rainfall for central and south-east Australia.\u201cWithout climate change, we would still expect this summer to be hot and dry because of El Ni\u00f1o and the positive [Indian Ocean Dipole],\u201d says Prof Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\u201cHowever, because Australia\u2019s warmed by almost 1.5 degrees celsius, it\u2019s going to be that much worse.\u201dSome of this increasing trend can be seen in the number of hot days and heatwaves Australia has experienced over time. Guardian Australia compared the maximum temperature at Observatory Hill each day to the long term average \u2013 one that stretches back over a hundred years.Days with a max temperature in the top 10% of temperatures were classified as hot. A span of three or more consecutive days in the top 10% were classified as heatwave days. As average temperatures have increased, it appears more and more days surpass these thresholds.Chart showing the number of hot days and heatwave days in Sydney, by year. There are increasing numbers of both as time goes onThe number of hot and heatwave days since the start of the year doesn\u2019t come close to what was experienced during the same period in 2019. During 2019-20, Australia saw the huge black summer bushfires.But Perkins-Kirkpatrick says what Australia is experiencing now is unlike what we saw in 2019.\u201cIt sort of started off in a different way this summer compared to black summer. So black summer, there was that three year drought leading into summer. This summer, because we\u2019ve had the back-to-back La Ni\u00f1as, there\u2019s a little moisture in the system.\u201d\u201cBut that could very well change very quickly.

So when a female was seen apparently caring for the offspring of another species, it came as a bit of a surprise. \u201cI saw straight away there was something weird about it,\u201d says Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Mrusczok, who was working as a spotter on the L\u00e1ki Tours whale-watching boat that witnessed the encounter.The ship\u2019s crew initially thought it was a very small killer whale calf swimming alongside the orca, but photos later confirmed what Mrusczok suspected \u2013 that the female, called S\u00e6d\u00eds, appeared to be looking after a newborn long-finned pilot whale.The unique sighting happened near Sn\u00e6fellsnes, west Iceland, in August 2021, and is now the subject of a research paper published in the Canadian Journal of Zoology. \u201cIt\u2019s another level of empathy we see in these animals if they are capable of caring for another species,\u201d says Mrusczok, who is president of conservation nonprofit Orca Guardians Iceland and a researcher at the West Iceland Nature Research Centre.View image in fullscreenBig fin, little fin: a close-up shot of the adult orca and pilot whale calf together. Photograph: orcaguardians.orgThe question researchers have been unable to answer is whether the calf was adopted after being orphaned or abandoned, or whether S\u00e6d\u00eds stole the calf from its parents. \u201cThere are many possibilities \u2026 but what we can say for sure is that the female showed protective behaviour towards the pilot whale calf,\u201d Mrusczok says.The newborn was seen swimming in the \u201cdrafting\u201d position next to the orca, which means it was getting dragged along by her and needed less energy for swimming. It is not known if the attraction from the calf was mutual, or how long their association went on for.The pair were seen swimming together for 21 minutes, and were accompanied by two other adults \u2013 a female named Dragonfly and a male called Zale who are often together as a group. Dragonfly and Zale tolerated the calf, but it is not known if, or how, they interacted with it directly.View image in fullscreenAn orca swims with her own calf in Norwegian waters. Photograph: Cavan Images/AlamyOrcas and pilot whales have similar social structures, forming strong, long-term bonds between mother and offspring, so researchers believe that caregiving between the species could be a possibility. Although the calf was emaciated, it did appear that it was being cared for by the orca.S\u00e6d\u00eds has never had her own offspring over the nine years researchers have been following her, and so it is unlikely she was producing any milk that would have sustained the calf.One theory is that the orca may have had a miscarriage or lost a newborn just before this encounter, and could have been looking after the pilot whale calf as a substitute, although there is no evidence to support this.Watching orcas has taught me that there is always mystery, there is always more to find outTh\u00e9r\u00e8se Mrusczok, researcherGroups of killer whales and pilot whales are known to chase and antagonise each other. Researchers believe they do this because they are competing over resources \u2013 in Iceland, probably Atlantic herring or mackerel.In 2022, researchers saw something else they had not observed before: pilot whales coming back after being chased away. They did this three times. The researchers wrote in the paper: \u201cIt is possible that the movements of the killer whale group as a whole could have been influenced by an active effort of SN0540 [S\u00e6d\u00eds] to obtain another pilot whale calf.\u201dRob Lott from Whale and Dolphin Conservation, who was not involved in the research, says: \u201cThese creatures spend the majority of their lives underwater out of view and often far out at sea, so maybe this extraordinary encounter isn\u2019t that unusual. But what is exciting is that it\u2019s the first time it has been documented.\u201cIf it was an abduction or kidnap, this may go some way in explaining why long-finned pilot whales are often seen chasing pods of orcas away.\u201dAgony on a Cornish beach: what do whale strandings tell us about our oceans?Read moreAlthough this is the first time this behaviour, called interspecific alloparenting, has been observed in orcas, it has been seen in other cetacean species. Short-beaked common dolphins, common bottlenoses, Indian Ocean humpbacks and Indo-Pacific humpbacks have all been observed looking after the young of other species.Mrusczok says: \u201cAnything is possible \u2013 watching orcas has taught me I never know what\u2019s happening. There is always mystery, there is always more to find out.\u201dS\u00e6d\u00eds was again spotted interacting with long-finned pilot whales in 2022, but the calf was no longer with her, and it is presumed to have died.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

The huge snapping turtle, known to all as Shnappy, weighs an enormous 50lbs and is a fixture in the New York borough of Staten Island, where he has long resided in Clove Lakes Park.And while the rest of New York struggles with many crises, from recent floods to perennial issues like crime and subway violence, it is the currently unknown whereabouts of Shnappy that has many on Staten Island worried.Shnappy, and his almost-as-large friend Jeffrey, went missing two weeks ago, sparking a wave of conspiracy theories as to their fate. Many locals suspect poachers took the pair for soup, but no one really knows \u2013 no turtle thieves were caught on park security cameras.\u201cAnecdotally, we are aware that community members have discussed turtles allegedly being removed from this park, but we have not witnessed this occurring,\u201d said parks department spokesperson Gregg McQueen. \u201cNYC Parks has not directly received any specific accounts or 311 reports regarding people taking wildlife from Clove Lakes Park.\u201d\u201cWildlife plays an important role in our city\u2019s ecosystem, and it is vital that we do all we can to protect the animals that inhabit our city\u2019s parks and green spaces. It is illegal to remove, harm, or kill animals in parks. If New Yorkers see this activity, they should call 911,\u201d he added by email.But there\u2019s little doubt that the disappearance of Shnappy, who was believed to be a male, and Jeffrey, believed to be a female, has left an emotional hole in Staten Island.\u201cJeffrey has been here, like, forever,\u201d said Natacha Beck, a hostess at the Stone House, a restaurant and wedding venue overlooking the lake. They, referring to alleged poachers, \u201cwould have to have known who he was\u201d.For Stone House, the giant turtles had been a marketing tool. But they were also clever enough to swim over whenever there are customers on the deck. \u201cThey\u2019re not stupid,\u201d said Bella Trembone, 20. \u201cThey see people sitting and come over for bread.\u201d\u201cWe definitely didn\u2019t eat them here \u2013 we don\u2019t have turtle on the menu,\u201d she added. \u201cThey were part of our life, part of the the Stone House.\u201dAt between 50 to 75 years old, Shnappy, according to the New York Post, was known for his sexual appetites. His mating with Jeffrey apparently made sounds like the \u201ccrack of a baseball\u201d on a bat, according to the infamous city tabloid which is usually more obsessed with celebrity sexual shenanigans than those of turtles.A parks department spokesperson said they assumed the pair were a couple because they swam around together.If they were taken for their meat, Shnappy and Jeffrey would not be the first turtle-related crime. Five years ago, a Brooklyn wildlife group posted on social media that five women were questioned by police and the park\u2019s enforcement officers for luring turtles out of the water and bagging them up.But in recent months, summons have been issued to individuals illegally clamming on Staten island, with fines issued of up to $1,000. Unwise for other reasons too \u2013 Manhattan\u2019s sewer system doubles as a storm drain and the harbor\u2019s e coli count spikes after heavy rains.Aside from turtles and clams, foraging in city\u2019s parks is seeing an uptick in interest. \u201cWildman\u201d Steve Brill, a vegan who leads foraging tours of Central Park, says his expeditions are now joined by as many as 100 people. In 1982, when he began, just one person signed up.\u201cPeople are more interested in the environment, in nature and ecology,\u201d he says of the boom in urban nature exploration.At this time of year, his customers will likely come across giant, purple-spored, and jetsetter puffballs; bears\u2019 head, chicken and maitake mushrooms; nuts, including white oak acorns, gingko nuts, black walnuts; and sassafras, a root bark with medicinal properties once used to make root beer, and chickweed. The list goes on.But while park officials may turn a blind eye to mushroom foraging, amphibious reptiles are different.\u201cI\u2019ve not seen anyone hunting for animals in the parks,\u2019 Brill says. \u201cIt must be very rare and very bad people. They can come on my tours and get all the renewable herbs, weeds, berries, nuts, mushrooms and dandelions they need. If people are poaching animals, it\u2019s all new to me.\u201d",

        "text": "One of the largest seagrass beds in the UK, home to seahorses, pipefish and scallops and a highly effective carbon sink, has been identified off the south coast of Cornwall.An acoustic study of St Austell Bay carried out by a survey boat pinpointed 359 hectares (887 acres) of seagrass hugging the coastline, and divers sent in to examine the site close up recorded 56 species living in the rich habitat.Cornwall Wildlife Trust described it as a hugely positive find but said work was needed to protect the bed and further surveys should be carried out to find out if there were other beds in nearby areas.Abby Crosby, marine conservation officer for the trust, said: \u201cThe discovery of extensive surviving seagrass beds in St Austell Bay is a very exciting development. Seagrass is one of the largest carbon sinks we have globally, despite covering only 0.1% of the ocean floor.\u201cIt also serves as a shelter, feeding ground and nursery for a host of marine life, including vulnerable species such as seahorses, and the young of commercial fish and seafood stocks. Seagrass beds play an important role in helping to combat erosion of the coastline from the waves, as storms increase in their intensity due to climate change.\u201dSeagrass meadows, which can flower and photosynthesise in shallow seas, are important because they stabilise the sediments in which they grow and provide food and shelter for other species thereby enhancing biodiversity.They also sequester and store carbon in their leaves, branches and root systems, as well as in the sediment below and around them. When seagrass meadows are stable and healthy, they can be highly effective carbon sinks.Among the marine animals seen by divers in the seagrass were the short-snouted seahorse, broadnosed pipefish, little cuttlefish and scallops.The volunteer divers also examined beds of maerl, delicate coral-like algae, a little further out from the coast, where they found an additional 66 species including the curled octopus and streaked gurnard.Some areas within the beds were free of litter and other human impact, though rubbish \u2013 and a large number of golf balls hit errantly from a seaside course \u2013 and some old fishing gear were found in other places.The St Austell Bay blue carbon mapping project is part of the G7 legacy project for nature recovery announced at the world leaders\u2019 summit held in Cornwall in 2021.A report on the project, published by Cornwall Wildlife Trust and Natural England, said that some poor weather and limited financial resources meant that not all the planned surveying work had been completed. It says management measures to protect the seagrass and maerl such as making them more visible to sea users through marker buoys should be considered.Seagrass beds are thought to have surrounded much of the UK before the Industrial Revolution but the wildlife trust said about 92% was lost in the last century. The decline has been caused by pollution, disease and coastal development. Additionally, damage from anchoring, moorings and dredging has affected the seagrass beds.Crosby said the project was a \u201csignificant first step\u201d in understanding the extent and quality of blue carbon habitats in the St Austell Bay area.She added: \u201cWe look forward to collaborating with a wide range of people, from local residents to marine business and government organisations, to ensure we protect these special marine habitats which will benefit all marine life and our coastal communities into the future.\u201d",

California is also running pilot projects to relocate beavers to places where they can be more beneficial.Catch her if you can: viral surfboard-swiping otter is on the loose, and fans love itRead moreThe aim is to preserve more beavers, along with their nature-friendly behaviors, including creating lush habitats that lure species back into now-urban areas, enhance groundwater supplies and buffer against the threat of wildfires.\u201cThere\u2019s been this major paradigm shift throughout the west where people have really transitioned from viewing beavers strictly as a nuisance species, and recognizing them for the ecological benefits that they have,\u201d said Valerie Cook, the beaver restoration program manager for California\u2019s department of fish and wildlife.The push follows similar efforts in other western states including Washington, which has a pilot beaver relocation program, Cook said. It marks a new chapter in Californians\u2019 lengthy history with the animals, which experts say used to be everywhere, but after years of trapping, attempts at reintroduction and then removal, they are found in much smaller numbers than they once were \u2013 largely in the Central valley and the northern part of the state.It is unknown how many beavers live in California, but hundreds of permits are sought by landowners each year that typically allow them to kill the animals. The beaver population in North America used to range between 100 million and 200 million but now totals between 10 million and 15 million, according to the state.Kate Lundquist, the director of the Water Institute at the Occidental Arts & Ecology Center, said she expects California\u2019s changes will lead to fewer beavers killed in the state and a growth in wetland spaces. She said she believed the past three years of drought and devastating wildfires contributed to the state\u2019s shift on beavers.\u201cThere has been increased motivation to identify and fund the implementation of nature-based climate-smart solutions,\u201d she said. \u201cBeaver restoration is just that.\u201dBeavers live in family units and quickly build dams on streams, creating ponds. The pools help slow the flow of water, replenishing groundwater supplies, and can also stall the spread of wildfires \u2013 a critical issue for a state plagued by fires in recent years, said Emily Fairfax, professor of environmental science and management at California State University, Channel Islands.\u201cYou talk to anyone who has lived near beaver ponds. They\u2019ll tell you: these things don\u2019t burn,\u201d said Fairfax, who has researched beavers and the ponds they build.The animals are not a protected species, but they help create habitat that is critical for others, such as the coho salmon, which is listed under the Endangered Species Act. Young salmon grow and thrive in beaver ponds before heading to the ocean, which gives them a better shot at survival, said Tom Wheeler, the executive director of the Environmental Protection Information Center.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Vicky Monroe, statewide conflict programs coordinator for California\u2019s department of fish and wildlife, said her office has long received requests from groups that want beavers, but the state didn\u2019t have a mechanism to legally move them until recently.California has planned two pilot relocation projects, one of which would bring beavers back to the Tule River. Kenneth McDarment, a councilmember for the Tule River Indian Tribe, said the tribe started seeking ways to reintroduce beavers nearly a decade ago due to drought and hopes to see them relocated later this year.\u201cWe\u2019re going to give these beavers a chance to do what they do naturally in a place where they\u2019re wanted,\u201d he said.",

However, there were just seven in Scotland, two in Wales and none in Northern Ireland.Similarly, the Charge myHyundai website showed that there were 37 ultra-fast 350kW charging locations in Great Britain, six in the Republic of Ireland, \u201climited numbers\u201d in Wales and Scotland, and none in Northern Ireland.The bZ4X electric car from Toyota. Photograph: Nathan Leach-Proffer/APThe companies said their claims were not misleading as it was unlikely that drivers would need rapid-charging points on shorter journeys, meaning they could use the more widely available slower charge points, with many people using points fitted at home.However, the ASA said the manufacturers had given the impression it was \u201crelatively straightforward\u201d to access rapid-charging points across the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "The UK is still well off track on meeting its international commitments to cut methane emissions, analysis has shown, despite moves to stop cows from belching out so much of it.Ministers unveiled a host of initiatives to reduce UK greenhouse gas emissions in the government\u2019s \u201cgreen day\u201d of energy announcements more than a week ago, including plans to introduce methane-suppressing feed for livestock from 2025, and to stop biodegradable waste going to landfill from 2028.But these did not go far enough to reduce Britain\u2019s methane emissions by 30% by 2030, the target agreed under the global methane pledge that the UK signed before the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in 2021, according to analysis by the Green Alliance thinktank.It found that the government\u2019s policies would cut UK methane output by about 14%, compared with 2020 levels, by 2030.Ministers have rejected one significant measure to cut methane emissions, an immediate ban on routine flaring and venting from gas and oil drilling platforms in the North Sea. The review of the UK\u2019s net zero strategy by the former energy minister Chris Skidmore, as well as parliamentary committees, recommended bringing in such a ban from 2025, but the practice will be allowed to continue until at least 2030.Offshore operators waste enough gas to power more than 750,000 homes a year through flaring and venting, and enough to power at least 100,000 more from undetected leaks.Measures to cut the UK\u2019s methane in line with the pledge and beyond are still possible, according to the Green Alliance. Bringing forward the ban on flaring and venting, forcing landfill operators to capture methane at a higher rate than what escapes from rubbish dumps at present, mending the UK\u2019s existing leaky gas mains at a faster rate, and encouraging a swifter uptake of methane-suppressing feed for livestock could help the country achieve a reduction of more than 40% by 2030.Liam Hardy, of the Green Alliance, said: \u201cExisting measures to tackle UK methane emissions are wholly inadequate, but it\u2019s not too late to turn things around. The government should be able to put forward a plan to cut methane emissions by more than 43%. This would help get us closer to net zero and put the UK in a clear position of leadership ahead of international climate negotiations later this year.\u201dThe UK is also falling behind on its overall climate pledge to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, according to the government\u2019s own analysis.More than 100 countries are now signed up to the global methane pledge. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, with about 80 times the warming effect of carbon dioxide, though it has a shorter life in the atmosphere.Scientific consensus says cutting methane drastically is one of the quickest and surest ways to stave off the worst impacts of the climate crisis, and could help to reduce global temperature rises by as much as 0.5C within a few decades. But global methane emissions are still rising, and many countries have been misreporting their output of the gas.Satellite imaging is allowing a far clearer picture of global emissions than before. The Guardian recently revealed the existence of more than 1,000 \u201csuper-emitting\u201d methane sites around the world.The UK government disputed the Green Alliance findings. \u201cThis analysis is completely wrong. The UK has adopted early and ambitious measures to tackle methane emissions. Already this means that between 1990 and 2020 UK methane emissions fell by 62% \u2013 more than any other OECD country,\u201d a spokesperson said.\u201cWe recognise the urgency to do more, which is why we are going further and faster to reduce emissions in line with the net zero strategy and carbon budgets, and the global methane pledge, a global reduction target.\u201d",

Among renewable options, offshore wind was found to have the most uncertain pipeline, with the report concluding first power from offshore wind projects needed to occur in 2030.But the report concludes nuclear power should not be factored in to net zero plans and states that to \u201creduce renewable targets in the belief that nuclear will be deployed later at scale would create a material risk of not achieving net zero, or doing so at an excessive cost\u201d.Richard Bolt, principal at Nous Group, said: \u201cNuclear power should not be in our plans, because it\u2019s too expensive and slow. Only a dramatic fall in costs and prolonged renewable constraints would prompt a rethink.\u201d\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe report warns that Australia\u2019s path to net zero carbon emissions in 2050 will require faster, broader and more innovative decarbonisation efforts and the pipeline of large-scale solar and onshore wind projects risks falling short of the required build rate.The report modelled six scenarios, all of which included a fleet of gas-fired peaking plants to provide back-up to renewables and storage but with \u201cminimal\u201d actual use of gas.The report also finds carbon capture utilisation and storage is a \u201ccrucial component of a net zero strategy\u201d despite the technology not having delivered meaningful emissions cuts to date.In a scenario in which renewable energy deployment is constrained, the report finds blue hydrogen, which is hydrogen made using fossil fuels but with the C02 captured and stored, would be the dominant use for CCUS up to 2060. In scenarios where there is unconstrained use of renewables, the dominant use would be to offset emissions from the land use and aviation sectors.The report was produced by the University of Melbourne, the University of Queensland, Princeton University\u2019s Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment, as well as Nous Group.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Work on HS2 was halted on Saturday after a mysterious five-metre square pool of bubbling foam emerged above the ground where tunnelling was being carried out.The area on a rugby pitch in Ruislip, in a west London borough, has been cordoned off, danger signs have been erected, and an investigation is under way. Local residents described it as a \u201csinkhole\u201d, but a HS2 spokesperson said what had emerged from the ground was a slurry pool.The spokesperson said that tunnelling work has resumed at the site after it was halted on Saturday. It is understood that Environment Agency officials came to the scene and are monitoring the situation.The incident began when a brown, bubbling substance emerged from the ground. HS2 said the foam has now been cleared, but on Sunday afternoon lumps of white foam could be seen emerging from the grass on the playing field, which is owned by Hillingdon council and leased to Ruislip Rugby Club.SCS, a Skanska Costain Strabag joint venture, is constructing 13 miles of twin-bore tunnels on the HS2 route to its southern terminus at Euston. The West Ruislip tunnel is being created using a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM).When the contractors saw what was happening, they sealed off the area and started extra ground monitoring with the aim of preventing subsidence resulting from the leak. Additional ground anchors are being installed to protect against subsidence.The contractors believe the leak was the result of an existing borehole, which caused slurry to travel up the borehole and pool on the surface. They will continue to monitor the area over the next few days.The chair of the rugby club, Jatin Radia, said: \u201cLocal residents have been up in arms about the HS2 project. When something like this happens, it raises concerns about unintended consequences.\u201cThis happened on a field, but what about houses which are being tunnelled under? How can HS2 reassure residents? The question is, is it safe?

The pool appears to have come out of an existing borehole, causing foam to travel up and pool on the surface. The area is safe, the leak has been sealed, and the foam has been cleared.\u201dAccording to HS2 sources the borehole is now sealed behind one of HS2\u2019s tunnel rings. This article was amended on 20 February 2023 to clarify that Ruislip is in a west London borough.",

        "text": "Ministers were warned about the dangers of private equity taking over the water industry in a briefing that has been kept secret for 20 years, the Guardian can reveal.Details of the analysis are still being withheld as sewage pollution and the failure of water companies to invest in infrastructure are under national scrutiny.On Thursday the water industry \u2013 after more than three decades running a privatised model \u2013 apologised for its failures to properly manage and invest in water, and for the scale of raw sewage discharges that have fuelled huge public anger.It promised to triple funding in pipes, treatment works and infrastructure over the next decade to \u00a310bn and apologised for polluting beaches and rivers with raw sewage. But all of this will be paid for by increased customer bills.The report being withheld from publication predicted the state of the privatised water industry today, and warned against private equity being allowed to move into water firms.It was prepared for the Competition Commission (now the Competition and Markets Authority, CMA) in 2002 and has never been published in full. It should have been released under the 20-year rule last summer, but despite repeated attempts to have it published it is being kept secret.Today, as private equity dominates ownership of the water sector in England, bringing with it high levels of debt and underinvestment leading to sewage pollution, water shortages and leaks, the author of the report has called for full disclosure of his warning two decades ago.Sewage pollution being discharged into rivers was a major issue in the May 2023 English local elections. Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianChris Goodall, who wrote the report for the Competition Commission investigation into a proposed takeover of Southern Water, said: \u201cMy real concern was about the financial structure of the proposed deal. In my view the transaction created an entity which would prove impossible to regulate.\u201cLarge external private equity shareholders would load the company with debt and Ofwat inevitably would lose any regulatory control. For example, it would prove extremely difficult to ensure that water companies invested enough in sewage control.\u201cThis report should be published in full now because it helps to show why the last 20 years of increasing private equity dominance of the water industry has proved so disastrous.\u201dThis year the chief executive of Thames Water, Sarah Bentley, admitted high levels of pollution in rivers were the result of \u201cdecades of underinvestment\u201d by the privatised water company. New data from the Financial Times shows the 10 biggest water companies more than doubled their dividend payments to shareholders in 2022 to \u00a31.4bn, despite an outcry over sewage pollution in rivers and a failure to invest in infrastructure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But eight months on from the date it should have been published, it has not been released.The CMA has warned it would be exempt from releasing the report under freedom of information laws if a request to do so was submitted.

        "text": "Brazilian activists have voiced outrage after congress moved to drastically dilute the powers of the environment and Indigenous peoples ministries in what campaigners called a potentially crippling blow to efforts to protect Indigenous communities and the Amazon.Hopes that Brazil could turn the page on Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s era of Amazon devastation were sky-high after the far-right leader lost last year\u2019s presidential election to the leftist Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. During his campaign Lula vowed to stamp out environmental crime and champion Indigenous people, and after taking power in January put the veteran environmentalist Marina Silva in charge of environmental affairs and made the Indigenous activist S\u00f4nia Guajajara head of a new ministry for Indigenous peoples.But that optimism received a dramatic reality check on Wednesday as members of the conservative-dominated congress \u2013 where the ruralista caucus representing agribusiness interests remains a powerful force \u2013 moved to severely weaken both ministries.By 15 votes to 3, a congressional committee approved draft legislation that would strip the environment ministry of control of the rural environmental registry, a key tool in the fight against illegal deforestation and land-grabbing, and water resources. The rule change would also strip the ministry for Indigenous peoples of responsibility for delimiting Indigenous territories, handing those powers to the justice ministry.Silva and Guajajara both denounced the moves, amid anger and alarm that members of Lula\u2019s administration had not done more to oppose the changes, which are likely to be voted on by the lower house and senate in the coming days.\u201cThey are fleecing the environment ministry,\u201d Marina Silva told the newspaper O Globo.\u201cThe Brazilian people elected President Lula but it seems congress wants a repeat of the Bolsonaro government,\u201d Silva added, warning the moves would undermine Brazil\u2019s international claims to be committed to fighting deforestation and climate change.Guajajara told AFP that attempts to erode her ministry\u2019s powers went \u201ctotally against what president Lula is defending\u201d and represented a \u201cstep backwards\u201d for Indigenous rights.A prominent political columnist, Miriam Leit\u00e3o, claimed the changes were tantamount to \u201cthe demolition of the [two] ministries\u201d.In a separate move, the lower house also approved plans for an imminent vote on legislation which activists fear would annul all Indigenous claims to land Indigenous people were not physically inhabiting when Brazil\u2019s constitution came into force in 1988.On Twitter, Guajajara called that manoeuvre \u201cgenocidal\u201d and a direct attack on Indigenous rights, territories and the fight against climate change.\u2018A war society doesn\u2019t see\u2019: the Brazilian force driving out mining gangs from Indigenous landsRead moreThe developments came as a shock to environmentalists who had hoped South America\u2019s largest country was entering a new, greener era after four bleak years under Bolsonaro during which illegal deforestation soared.Greenpeace Brasil called the moves an act of anti-environmental \u201cbarbarity\u201d. Opi, the campaign group founded by Bruno Pereira, the Brazilian activist murdered last year with the British journalist Dom Phillips, denounced \u201ca terrible day for Indigenous rights\u201d.Marcio Astrini, the chief executive of the Climate Observatory environmental watchdog, said the moves \u2013 if approved in their current form \u2013 would deal a severe blow to the environment ministry and an even greater one to the Indigenous ministry, whose raison d\u2019\u00eatre was the demarcation of Indigenous lands.\u201cIt would be like having a finance ministry that couldn\u2019t handle fiscal or tax policy. It would be like having a health ministry that didn\u2019t run the NHS,\u201d Astrini said, urging Lula\u2019s administration to find ways to block or alter the proposed changes.\u201cThe government is going to have to take some decisions \u2026 Will it cave in to all the demands of the ruralistas and Bolsonaristas in congress? Or will it stick to President Lula\u2019s campaign promises? It seems very clear to me it can\u2019t do both,\u201d he added.Amid a major outcry on Wednesday, one report suggested Lula\u2019s administration was considering a legal challenge to the changes. Speaking on the television network GloboNews, the minister of institutional relations, Alexandre Padilha, insisted: \u201c[People can be] absolutely certain sustainability is at the heart of president Lula\u2019s government\u201d.",

No nos vamos a detener. pic.twitter.com/we0TVqD7us\u2014 Rodolfo Delgado (@FiscalGeneralSV) January 11, 2023\nRights groups fear that the community leaders, who are being held at a police station in the capital, San Salvador, could languish in overcrowded cells for months before formal charges are filed in court. The ongoing state of emergency has suspended a wide range of civil liberties and led to widespread arbitrary detentions and other abuses, according to United Nations experts.The detained men are renowned community organisers and water protectors, who helped lead the historic and successful campaign that convinced the Salvadoran legislature to unanimously pass a ban on metals mining in 2017 to save that nation\u2019s rivers. Amid worsening drought caused by the climate crisis, El Salvador could run out of drinking water by the end of the century unless radical action is taken to rehabilitate its contaminated waterways.Environmental organisations fear that the arrests were a calculated attempt to destabilise community opposition as the economically stressed government seeks to overturn the mining ban.Bukele is under enormous pressure to find new revenue streams after his ill-advised embrace of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin failed spectacularly.In recent months, local officials in Caba\u00f1as have reportedly been approached about mining projects, while unknown individuals have offered to buy land where former mines are located.Detainee Antonio Pacheco, director of the Association of Economic and Social Development (Ades) and former guerrilla leader, had alerted officials and organizations about these suspicious activities.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the arrests are politically motivated,\u201d said Pedro Cabezas, coordinator of the Central American alliance on mining. \u201cAll five leaders were part of the anti-mining movement which started in Caba\u00f1as, where it\u2019s clear the current government wants to restart mining.\u201d",

This equates to an average of 64 sewage dumps a day, or a new sewage dump taking place every 22 minutes.The sewage scandal has become a hot topic at the local elections, and the government recently released a plan to tackle the issue of raw waste being dumped into waterways. However, the environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, has said she believes the infrastructure needed to stop the spills is too expensive.She also wrote this week in the online magazine ConservativeHome that she believes Labour and the Liberal Democrats have been \u201cscamming\u201d the public by drawing attention to the issue.The shadow environment secretary, Jim McMahon, said: \u201cThe first duty of any member of parliament is to the people that send them to Westminster. That Tory cabinet ministers allow the areas that they represent to be sullied in tonnes of filthy raw sewage shows they have no respect for the places where their constituents live and work.\u201cThe next Labour government will build a better Britain, ending the Tory sewage scandal by delivering mandatory monitoring on all sewage outlets, introducing automatic fines for discharges, setting ambitious targets for stopping systematic sewage dumping and ensuring that water bosses are held to account for negligence.\u201dMcMahon recently introduced the water quality (sewage discharge) bill, which proposes four measures: setting a legal requirement for the monitoring of all sewage outlets and penalties for failures in adhering to monitoring requirements; imposing automatic fines for sewage dumping; implementing a legally binding target to reduce sewage dumping events; and a requirement for the secretary of state to publish a strategy for the reduction of sewage discharges and regular economic impact assessments.A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said:  \u201cBy bringing in proper monitoring of storm overflows \u2013 up from 7% in 2010 to 91% now \u2013 this government has enabled the extent of sewage discharges to be revealed so that we are better equipped to tackle it.\u201cOur new Plan for Water sets out the increased investment, tougher enforcement and tighter regulation to tackle the issue.

        "text": "Listening to the chatter at Delhi\u2019s vegetable markets, only one question is on everyone\u2019s lips: just how much will a tomato cost today?Prices of tomatoes, a staple of Indian cooking, have soared by more than 400% in recent weeks as the country has been gripped by a nationwide shortage.The shortage has been attributed to the irregular weather that has ravaged India during this year\u2019s season for tomatoes, including unseasonable high rainfall in recent months, which devastated the growing crops and fuelled a deadly fungal disease.While those in cities such as Mumbai or Delhi used to pay 40 rupees (40p) for a kilo of tomatoes, prices have shot up to 160 rupees and higher, making them largely unaffordable for an average low-income household.Traders have warned prices could hit record highs of 200 rupees a kilo in the next few days as the recent heavy monsoon rains have spoiled more stock.While July is often a more expensive season for buying tomatoes, as it falls between harvests, consumers said they had never seen prices so high.The shortage has even hit outlets of the fast-food chain McDonald\u2019s in India. In branches of McDonald\u2019s across north, east and south India, signs were put up to state that tomatoes would no longer be put in burgers and other dishes, due to a lack of availability.A spokesperson for a McDonald\u2019s operator in north India confirmed they had removed tomatoes temporarily from food in some branches, due to \u201cseasonal crop issues arising out of farm fields in a few regions\u201d which meant there were \u201cnot enough quantities meeting our quality specifications\u201d.\u201cWe should be able to bring tomatoes back to the menu soon,\u201d they added.The human-caused climate emergency is making extreme rainfall more common and more intense, while heatwaves are increasingly likely to happen.Several small-scale tomato farmers said this had been one of their most devastating seasons in terms of production and profit.Arvind Malik, 34, a tomato farmer from Kheri Dabdalan village in the Kurukshetra district of Haryana, described how disease began to strike this season\u2019s crop.\u201cIn February, the leaves of tomato plants started drying up,\u201d he said. \u201cThe experts told us that irregular weather \u2013 sudden rise and decline in temperatures \u2013 is the reason behind the disease in our tomatoes. We got expensive fungicides and sprayed them on our crop. Somehow the disease stopped but only after ruining a lot of crops.\u201dMalik said that while they usually sold 30,000kg of tomatoes every year, this year they could only harvest half of that and he was now heavily in debt.The current shortage, and high prices now commanded for the few tomatoes left on the market, have been particularly galling for farmers such as Malik, who just a few months ago were having to dump their produce on the streets because the commercial prices of tomatoes were so low, often just 1.5 rupees a kilo \u2013 not even enough to cover costs.India floods: monsoon rains leave 22 dead in north as Delhi sees wettest July day in decadesRead more\u201cWe stopped picking tomatoes and selling them because it was a total loss,\u201d said Malik. In June, prices began to surge as the shortages hit, but by then Malik had nothing to sell except rotten leftovers.Other staple produce, including onions, ginger and chillis have been affected by rising prices due to weather-related issues damaging the crops.Traders said it could take up to three months for supplies and prices to normalise, likely to fuel increasing discontent among consumers who are already dealing with rising prices due to inflation, and anger with the government.\u201cI had to sell my produce for less than two rupees a kilogram, and now the same is being sold for 160 rupees in the market,\u201d said Malik. \u201cToday, I cannot afford to buy even one kilogram of tomatoes.\u201d",

In 2015, Climate Heroes listed Hong as a hero working tirelessly to protect the environment.On 25 October 2022, Hong announced that she would be closing Change after running it for 10 years, amid wider fears of a crackdown on civil society. On 10 May, as Vietnam reported a record-breaking temperature of 44.1 degrees, Hong tweeted: \u201cYeah, I am melting like a piece of butter on frying pan. Climate change is happening no matter what we do. But we should still do everything to not make it worse. I had to shut down my NGO due to pressures, but I\u2019ll find another way.\u201dAt the Cop26 conference in Glasgow in 2021, prime minister Pham Minh Chinh said Vietnam will commit to reaching net zero carbon emission by 2050, even though Vietnam still gets more than 50% of its energy from coal.Despite such bold claims, other prominent environmentalists such as Dang Dinh Bach, who heads the Law and Policy of Sustainable Development Research Center, remain in prison.

At Stoke Fleming, near Blackpool Sands beach in Devon, there were 63 sewage spills lasting 1,014 hours; and at Meadfoot beach in Torquay, Devon, there were 79 dumps lasting 946 hours.The figures come from an analysis of Environment Agency data done by the Liberal Democrats.The environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, will announce government plans to clean up Britain\u2019s waterways on Tuesday, but critics say the headline policy of banning plastic in wet wipes was first announced in 2018.Coffey will also say her team is looking at reducing PFAS substances \u2013 known as forever chemicals \u2013 in materials. But her Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) admitted it did not yet have a \u201cfirm course of action\u201d.The Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson Tim Farron said: \u201cYet again, the Conservative government is taking the public for fools by re-announcing a wet wipe policy from five years ago. This is a complete farce. The government is all talk and no action when it comes to protecting our rivers and oceans from foul pollution.\u201cThe main cause of water pollution is the water firms. Ministers are still letting water companies get away with an environmental scandal and today\u2019s pathetic announcement will do nothing to stop that.\u201dCoffey has been under pressure to show that the government is acting on the sewage dumping scandal as it is becoming an issue in local elections, with rising public anger over the situation.Farron called again for Coffey to resign. The Lib Dems previously said she should leave her post over sewage statistics released last week. He said: \u201cThis is further proof why Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey should resign. We need an environment secretary who actually cares about the environment. Instead, the environment secretary plans to let water companies dump sewage for decades to come whilst stealing wet wipe policies from years ago.\u201dOther measures in the government\u2019s water plan include allowing unlimited fines for polluting water companies, and launching a national policy statement to allow water infrastructure to be built more easily.

These nutrients, when untreated, cause algal blooms that choke the life from rivers.Under the current system, which is derived from EU law, developers are not allowed to add more pollution to already-polluted protected areas, unless they buy \u201ccredits\u201d that are used to improve nearby wetlands.In a letter to the secretaries of state Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey and Michael Gove, the chair of the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP), Dame Glenys Stacey, said their proposed amendment, which they claim will unlock 100,000 new homes, would degrade the environment.She wrote: \u201cThe proposed changes would demonstrably reduce the level of environmental protection provided for in existing environmental law. They are a regression. Yet the government has not adequately explained how, alongside such weakening of environmental law, new policy measures will ensure it still meets its objectives for water quality and protected site condition.\u201dCampaigners have previously called the OEP, which replaces the EU in enforcing environmental law, \u201ctoothless\u201d. It has written to the environment secretary and her predecessors on numerous occasions to express concern that her department\u2019s plans will contravene environmental law.However, Coffey has been able to ignore it and proceed with her plans regardless.Stacey has demanded the ministers face parliament to explain themselves and tell colleagues how they plan to prevent rivers being choked by pollution.The solicitor and civil servant said the ministers were contravening their promises to parliament, referring to \u201cGove\u2019s statement to parliament, under section 20 of the Environment Act 2021, that \u2018the bill will not have the effect of reducing the level of environmental protection provided for by any existing environmental law\u2019\u201d. She said the \u201camendments now run counter to these commitments\u201d.She said: \u201cIt is essential to clarify the section 20 statement made to parliament in light of the government\u2019s intention to weaken the habitats regulations. If necessary, ministers should make a statement equivalent to that required by section 20(4) and confirm that they are no longer able to say that the bill would not reduce the level of environmental protection provided for by any existing environmental law, but that the government nevertheless wishes parliament to proceed.\u201dShe said England\u2019s important wildlife areas were already at risk, writing: \u201cMany of England\u2019s most important protected wildlife sites are in a parlous state, with their condition well below where it needs to be. This is often due to nutrient pollution, and development can be a significant contributor to this.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They still said there would be no regression in environmental standards, despite the ditching of the legislation, because Natural England would be able to offset any pollution with the new funding.The government has faced a backlash from nature groups since the announcement, with the RSPB calling Gove and Coffey \u201cliars\u201d. The charity accused them of breaking their promises that Brexit would improve the UK\u2019s environment and that they would not weaken EU-derived environmental laws.A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always been clear we will never compromise our high standards and we are fully committed to our ambitious and legally binding commitments on the environment.

But new research indicates that exposure to parks, trees and other green spaces can slow the rates at which our cells age.The study, published in Science of the Total Environment, found that people who lived in neighborhoods with more green space had longer telomeres, which are associated with longer lives and slower ageing.New York will plant thousands of trees using new tech to maximize foliage impactRead moreTelomeres are structures that sit on the ends of each cell\u2019s 46 chromosomes, like the plastic caps on shoelaces, and keep DNA from unraveling. The longer a cell\u2019s telomeres, the more times it can replicate. When telomeres become so short that cells can\u2019t divide, the cells die.\u201cResearch is now showing that where we live, what we are exposed to, how much we exercise, what we eat, each of these can impact the speed of telomeres degrading and again our ageing process,\u201d said Aaron Hipp, a professor of parks, recreation and tourism management at North Carolina State and a co-author of the study. \u201cA longer telomere is usually a younger telomere, or a more protective, helpful telomere. It is protecting that cell from the ageing process.\u201dGreen space promotes physical activity and community interaction, which are both associated with better health outcomes. Neighborhoods with plenty of trees and greenery are also often cooler, more resistant to flooding and have lower rates of air pollution.However, Hipp noted, participants who lived in green neighborhoods that were also plagued by pollution and segregation did not have longer telomeres than similar communities with less greenery. \u201cGreen space [still] matters,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just shows how important it is that we get to a level playing field first, so that people have the time and space to go out and enjoy green spaces.\u201dHipp and his colleagues looked at the medical records (that included measures of telomere lengths from biological samples) and survey responses from more than 7,800 people who participated in a national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey conducted between 1999 and 2002. The researchers connected that information with census data to estimate the amount of green space in each person\u2019s neighborhood. They found that a 5% increase in a neighborhood\u2019s green space was associated with a 1% reduction in the ageing of cells. \u201cThe more green the area, the slower the cell ageing,\u201d said Hipp.Scott Ogletree, a lecturer in landscape and wellbeing at the University of Edinburgh and the report\u2019s lead author, said that green spaces had little impact on telomere length when participants lived in low-income or segregated areas, raising new questions about the relationship between human health and the environment. \u201cIt does seem that the neighborhood context\u201d of pollution and segregation \u201cmight be washing out any benefit we see from the green space on this particular aspect of people\u2019s health.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Until relatively recently, Dutch farming prowess was hailed as one of the wonders of the global economy. In 2017, a National Geographic article headlined \u201cThis tiny country feeds the world\u201d encapsulated a sense of national pride at the Netherlands\u2019 status as the second-biggest exporter of agricultural products by value behind the United States.These days, Dutch farmers are in the headlines for less upbeat reasons. As the climate emergency and a related biodiversity crisis belatedly take centre stage in policymaking, the prime minister, Mark Rutte, has committed to halving the country\u2019s overall nitrogen emissions by 2030. A large proportion of these are generated by the manure and urine produced by more than 100m cattle, pigs and chickens. To reach the target, and protect biodiversity in the polluted countryside, the government has announced plans to reduce livestock numbers by a third. Reluctant farmers have been warned they could be subject to compulsory buyouts.That, at least, is the policy. Turning it into a reality is proving a challenge. As other European countries also look to overhaul their agriculture sectors, Dutch farms have become a test case in navigating the vital politics of the green transition. Last week, protesting farmers confronted the finance minister, Sigrid Kaag, with burning torches. Tractors have blockaded roads, and slurry has been dumped at the home of the minister for nature, Christianne van der Wal. Meanwhile, the far right has successfully co-opted the farmers\u2019 cause, and promoted a toxic conspiracy theory that targeted farmland is being sequestrated in order to build homes for asylum seekers.The intimidation tactics used by elements of the farmers\u2019 protest movement have been rightly condemned. But the rural backlash has generated widespread public sympathy \u2013 particularly outside the major cities. Ahead of crucial regional elections this month, a new Farmer-Citizen party is running third in the polls. If it wins enough seats in the Dutch senate to form a blocking alliance with the far right, the aims of the \u201cnitrogen law\u201d could be thwarted.This would send a terrible signal. UN researchers estimate that, without decisive action, agricultural greenhouse gas emissions alone will take the world beyond the tipping point of 1.5C of warming. The emblematic standoff between Dutch ministers and the country\u2019s farmers demonstrates that achieving the necessary reductions will require working collaboratively with those whose livelihoods and way of life are affected; that also means battling the insidious influence of the far right and providing resources to ease the transition.In the Netherlands, some progress on these fronts has been made. But for years, governments in The Hague celebrated intensive farming as a Dutch success story. Mr Rutte is now playing catch-up by imposing a revolution from above. More should have been done earlier to address the brewing crisis and get support for change from farming organisations. Meanwhile, a \u20ac24bn government fund \u2013 which would help some farmers diversify and relocate away from pollution hotspots \u2013 is yet to be signed off by the EU, which has concerns over state aid implications.That deal should be swiftly expedited. As extreme political forces seek to leverage the green transition for their own ends, the stakes are huge. In farming, as with car manufacturing and in other industries, meaningful progress towards net zero will only come if those at the sharp end are persuaded to come on board for the journey.",

        "text": "The new energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, has followed a path well trodden by high-profile Tories, from Oxford University, via the City and the thinktanks of Westminster, to the cabinet table.She takes over a department created only six months ago, which faces both the immediate challenge of overseeing the energy sector through another tough winter; and a slew of longer-term questions about the government\u2019s net zero strategy.Like many of the fresh batch of Conservative MPs catapulted into parliament after 2019\u2019s \u201cget Brexit done\u201d election, Coutinho is staunchly behind Britain\u2019s exit from the EU \u2013 she once said she wanted to be an MP so she could deliver Brexit \u201cfrom the inside\u201d.She has also highlighted the environment as an issue she cares about \u2013 as a member of the Conservative Environment Network before joining government.But she will have to walk a difficult path, between her party\u2019s stated commitment to net zero, a position enshrined when Theresa May committed the UK to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 in one of her last acts as prime minister, and Rishi Sunak\u2019s apparent belief that a more sceptical position could win his party much-needed votes.Sunak repeatedly reaffirmed his enthusiasm for the environment during last year\u2019s leadership election, attributing it to his daughters\u2019 concerns for the planet\u2019s future.But after the Tories narrowly won July\u2019s Uxbridge byelection \u2013 ostensibly because of the unpopularity of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) there \u2013 Sunak used a photo-op inside Margaret Thatcher\u2019s old Rover to promise to review \u201canti-car\u201d policies.Coutinho will now have to navigate this tricky political territory \u2013 other contentious issues within her party include onshore windfarms and the rollout of heat pumps.Like Sunak, the 38-year-old Coutinho has spoken with pride about her Indian background, using her maiden speech to praise her grandmother, describing her as \u201cthe single greatest emblem of Conservative values that I know,\u201d a teacher, who \u201ctook her fashion lead firmly from the queen\u201d.Also like Sunak, Coutinho\u2019s parents worked in the NHS, and she attended a private school \u2013 in her case, James Allen\u2019s girls\u2019 school in Dulwich, south London. From there, she went on to study maths and philosophy at Oxford.After graduating, she crisscrossed between the private sector and the world of politics \u2013 including two years at Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s thinktank the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) and a stint at the big-four accountancy firm KPMG.She inherited the super-safe Conservative seat of East Surrey from Sam Gyimah \u2013 who was a rising Tory star himself before he defected to the Liberal Democrats over Brexit, just months before the 2019 general election.Claire Coutinho with Rishi Sunak, to whom she once served as a special adviser at the Treasury. Photograph: Simon Walker/No 10 Downing StreetBefore that, she had served as a special adviser, including to Sunak at the Treasury, at an earlier stage of his own fast-track cabinet career.Liz Truss had already brought Coutinho into government, giving her a junior role at the Department for Work and Pensions during her short-lived tenure at No 10 last year.Sunak then made her a children\u2019s minister at the Department for Education, where she championed the expansion of free nursery care.Green campaigners will hope her track record will now help her to secure the backing of the Treasury \u2013 notorious at Westminster as a roadblock against environmental policies. Her work at the CSJ also suggests a glimmer of interest in the challenges of low-income families facing high energy bills this winter.But observers hoping Coutinho will be prepared to rock the boat may well be disappointed: another key characteristic of her time at Westminster has been determined loyalty to the prime minister.On entering parliament, she served as his parliamentary private secretary, a role that involves liaising with backbench MPs. And just as Sunak benefited from his staunch support for Boris Johnson, Coutinho\u2019s loyalty appears to have served her well.",

But conservationists have found the habitats to be bare, with no amphibians or their young to be seen.Kathy Wormald, the chief executive of the amphibian charity Froglife, told the Guardian: \u201cWe are receiving a lot of reports of no amphibians \u2013 frogs, toads and newts. We are also getting reports from our toad patrollers of lower numbers migrating, but we will not know for definite until later in the year when we have all of their data.\u201cWe have noticed a steady increase in low numbers being reported by the public over the past few years. We think that the variable climate patterns, with warmer winters but then cold well into the spring months, when they would migrate to the ponds, is having an impact on their behaviour patterns.\u201dRare natterjack toads have been struggling due to changing weather patterns, with populations devastated.Emily Lake, who looks after the toads at the Cheshire Wildlife Trust, said: \u201cChanging weather patterns and lack of rain means we are seriously worried for the long-term survival of the natterjack toad colony at Red Rocks nature reserve on the Wirral.\u201cRare and protected natterjacks live in the sand dunes, spawning in shallow freshwater pools, fed by rainwater and runoff from surrounding land, and where pools are warmed by the sun. However, over the past few years with changing weather patterns and drier winters the ponds are not filling up properly over winter.\u201dShe said last year was particularly devastating because the lack of fresh water caused the natterjack pools to be filled with saltwater, and all 41 toadspawn strings in them were lost.\u201cThe passionate group of Our Dee Estuary citizen science volunteers who monitor the natterjack toad pools for spawn and tadpoles were visibly upset at the devastation of the potential natterjack population last year,\u201d Lake said.\u201cWe hope that a few brave toads are spawning in small pools amongst the reedbeds. However, this is risky. The tadpoles of common toads, also in the reedbeds, will eat natterjack tadpoles who are competing for the same habitat.\u201dRangers at the National Trust said they had also noticed a lack of frogs, toads and their spawn this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

What we do have is ponds that are still dry from last year, so there is a considerable reduction in habitat. This is also due to abstraction rather than just lack of rain.

Del Naja, also known as 3D, said Massive Attack hoped the gig would be a \u201cproof of concept\u201d to the music industry that low-carbon festivals are possible.The event, which will take place on 25 August 2024 on Clifton Downs, will be 100% powered by renewables. Every energy source will be battery or solar on the site, food vendors will be vetted to ensure they use locally sourced produce and a \u201cclimate-resilient woodland plantation in the south-west region\u201d will be created after the show.The festival is the group\u2019s latest intervention on the subject of touring and sustainability. In 2019, they teamed up with the University of Manchester\u2019s Tyndall Centre to map the carbon footprint of tours, producing a \u201croadmap\u201d for the industry that encouraged acts to reduce the amount of kit they brought with them and stop travelling by private jet.Festivals and groups have already made some changes, such as single-use plastic being banned from many sites. In 2000, Glastonbury began planting trees in the local environment, which absorb 800 tonnes of greenhouse gas a year and ensure the festival has a \u201cnet positive impact on the climate\u201d. Morrissey has insisted on venues he plays being \u201cmeat free\u201d, while Pearl Jam began offsetting their carbon emissions in 2003.But the Massive Attack event is targeting the biggest source of carbon emissions related to gigs: transport for the crowd itself.Mark Donne, a filmmaker and climate activist who has worked with Massive Attack on several projects, said 65% to 85% of emissions for large-scale shows comes from audience travel. He said it was something the industry did not want to face up to. \u201cThis will be the first show that meaningfully deals with that,\u201d he said.Massive Attack will give local fans priority when it comes to tickets, train travel will be encouraged, and the organisers are putting on free electric buses to ferry crowds back to Bristol Temple Meads station if they\u2019ve come from farther afield.Del Naja also called on artists to stop being \u201cgreenwashers\u201d for the music industry. \u201cWe\u2019ll wear \u2018the climate has changed\u2019 T-shirts and make declarations from the stage,\u201d he said, while suggesting some groups might be playing at events where the sponsors have connections to fossil fuels. \u201cUltimately, artists need to \u2026 [do] a bit more research on what they\u2019re getting into.\u201dIn 2021, the band had hoped to play a sustainable gig in Liverpool, but cancelled when it was revealed the venue was also due to host an arms fair.In October this year the group\u2019s \u201cbrilliant and eccentric\u201d guitarist Angelo Bruschini died aged 62 from lung cancer.",

In my spare time, I have also sprayed chalk paint on civic structures in protest at the lack of action on climate. So at first I expected to view the latest attacks on art as shocking but justifiable. After all, do these attacks not also reveal the fragility of what we hold dear? Do they not make us think about what we want to save for the next generation? Yet the answer to these questions, I decided, is mostly no. Instead, these attacks feel part of a helpless careering towards climate chaos.As splash after splash of acidic liquid hits the glass casings of art works by Van Gogh, Monet, Klimt, and now Emily Carr, everyone around the world who sees the photographs and footage is going through the same mental process: an astonished intake of breath, followed by the realisation that everything is actually fine. The art work is safe behind glass, tightly sealed by expert conservators. What looks dangerous is a mere spectacle, not a reality.They prove that the experts have everything in hand; that despite terrifying appearances, we don\u2019t need to worrySo much depends on context. In 2022, this mixture of fear and complacency is becoming a habit. It is all around us in the ongoing pandemic, and it is also fuelling climate breakdown. We are all aware of the disaster of climate breakdown, and most of us are fearful or worried, according to the recent census. But our governments are acting as if there is no rush. If the last few years have proven anything, it is that many people find it possible to be scared about a future of storms, floods, and unliveable temperatures \u2013 and also to decide that they need to buy a bigger car anyway.Learning to live in fear and complacency is an art; it takes practice. The Covid-19 pandemic was a terrifying warm-up, and the Just Stop Oil protests are now helping us keep it up. The protests prove that in an age of supersize institutions, even culture\u2019s most raw and fragile expressions of existence can be set behind sealed glass, such that real disasters seem almost impossible other than as spectacle. They prove that the experts have everything in hand; that despite terrifying appearances, we don\u2019t need to worry.As the repeated attacks on art begin to bore us, they prove what many people have come to believe: that the system will save us. Somehow. Because it has to. Surely someone, somewhere will have thought of this or that eventuality. My house won\u2019t just fall into the sea. The migration of a billion people from unliveably hot places will just be images on the telly.Writing not as an art historian, but as someone trying to resist the lure of complacency, I implore Just Stop Oil and other anti-art protesters to stop their performative attacks for this simple reason. So long as you keep on throwing soup at protective glass around great art works, you will just keep proving again and again, that \u201cthe system\u201d will save us. But eventually it won\u2019t. One day, the seal around the protective glass will not work, and then at last you will have proven disasters do and can happen, and not just in images.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Art WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "A major global deep ocean current has slowed down by approximately 30% since the 1990s as a result of melting Antarctic ice, which could have critical consequences for Earth\u2019s climate patterns and sea levels, new research suggests.Known as the Southern Ocean overturning circulation, the global circulation system plays a key role in influencing the Earth\u2019s climate, including rainfall and warming patterns. It also determines how much heat and carbon dioxide the oceans store.Melting Antarctic ice predicted to cause rapid slowdown of deep ocean current by 2050Read moreScientists warn that its slowdown could have drastic impacts, including increasing sea levels, altering weather patterns and depriving marine ecosystems of vital nutrients.\u201cChanges in the overturning circulation are a big deal,\u201d said the study\u2019s co-author, Dr Steve Rintoul, an oceanographer and expert on the Southern Ocean at the Australian government\u2019s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).The climate crisis: A three-week masterclass with academics, journalists and activistsRead more\u201cIt\u2019s something that is a concern because it touches on so many aspects of the Earth, including climate, sea level, and marine life.\u201dThe finding comes months after modelling, which Rintoul was involved in, that predicted a 40% slowdown in the circulation by 2050.\u201cThe model projections of rapid change in the deep ocean circulation in response to melting of Antarctic ice might, if anything, have been conservative,\u201d Rintoul said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing changes have already happened in the ocean that were not projected to happen until a few decades from now.\u201dThe overturning circulation originates in the cold and dense waters that plunge down deep off Antarctica\u2019s continental shelf and spread to ocean basins globally. It brings oxygen to the deep ocean and returns nutrients to the surface ocean.\u201cWhat\u2019s driven the slowing is the fact that that dense shelf water is not as dense as it used to be because it\u2019s not as salty as it used to be,\u201d Rintoul said.The melting of Antarctic glacial ice, the researchers found, has resulted in additional freshwater, increasing buoyancy.The study looked specifically at changes in overturning circulation in the Australian Antarctic basin, but the researchers believe a \u201ccircumpolar slowdown\u201d is occurring.\u201cThe Australian Antarctic basin is the best ventilated of all the deep basins in the sense that it gets more \u2026 oxygen-rich water getting to the the bottom,\u201d Rintoul said. \u201cThe signal in that basin might provide a kind of early warning of changes that might happen around Antarctica.\u201dDr Ariaan Purich of Monash University, who was not involved in the research, said the Australian Antarctic basin was downstream of the region in Antarctica experiencing the greatest melt of ice shelves and loss of land ice. \u201cIn that sense, it makes it an important region to study to see these meltwater impacts on the ocean circulation.\u201dPurich described the paper as significant for providing observational evidence for the slowing of large-scale ocean overturning as a result of the melting Antarctic ice sheet.\u201cWe\u2019re now seeing lots of lines of evidence that this melt water isn\u2019t only increasing sea levels \u2013 it\u2019s affecting the climate system in lots of different ways,\u201d Purich said.\u201cThis is pretty confronting. These are big changes that are happening in Antarctica that can affect our global climate.\u201dBetween 1994 and 2017, there was a net slowdown in the circulation by 0.8 sverdrups per decade, the study found. One sverdrup is a flow rate equivalent to 1 million cubic metres per second.The researchers found a temporary increase in the overturning circulation between 2009 and 2017, as a result of increased sea ice formation. \u201cThat was enough to compensate for the melt from glacial melt for a few years,\u201d Rintoul said.\u201cWe expect in the longer term that while there will be ups and downs related to sea ice formation, the overall trend is that Antarctica is losing more ice, is melting more, and that will gradually slow down this overturning circulation.\u201cUnless we act soon we will commit ourselves to changes that we\u2019d really rather avoid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to act to reduce emissions and we need to do everything we can as fast as we can.\u201dThe study, whose first author is Kathryn Gunn of the CSIRO and the University of Southampton, was published in the journal Nature Climate Change.",

        "text": "MPs have voted to support a controversial ban on importing hunting trophies from thousands of species into the UK, preventing British hunters from bringing the body parts of lions, elephants and giraffes into the country.A private member\u2019s bill put forward by the Conservative MP Henry Smith and backed by the government received the support of parliament after years of divisive debate on the issue. MPs from across the political spectrum spoke in favour of the legislation before it passed.The government says the law, which will now move for debate in the Lords, will strengthen the conservation of endangered species and has widespread support from the British public. The ban was part of the 2019 Conservative election manifesto and comes after a high-profile anti-trophy hunting campaign backed by celebrities including Ricky Gervais, Brian May, Ed Sheeran and Joanna Lumley.But many scientists, environmentalists and African community leaders have said the new law could inadvertently accelerate the loss of wildlife, and accused celebrity campaigners of \u201cneocolonialism\u201d. They point to the contributions of regulated trophy hunting to the recovery of populations of black and white rhino in Namibia and South Africa and the snow leopard in Tajikistan.Amid strong views on both sides and accusations of misinformation from pro-hunting groups and anti-trophy hunting campaigners, MPs backed an amendment from Sir Christopher Chope to create an expert advisory board on the import ban. The ban will cover about 6,000 species and include some of the most endangered and charismatic animals, including hippos, leopards and polar bears.British hunters are not a large part of the trophy hunting industry and the ban is considered largely symbolic by conservationists. In 2015, the killing of Cecil the lion by a trophy hunter in Zimbabwe provoked global outrage and revulsion at the industry, where hunters pay tens of thousands of pounds to shoot and pose with the bodies of wild animals.The actor Peter Egan, a prominent anti-trophy hunting campaigner, said the vote was \u201csensational\u201d news.Claire Bass, a senior director of campaigns and public affairs at Humane Society International-UK, also welcomed the vote. \u201cWe\u2019re delighted that this extremely popular bill has passed its report stage and third reading, with dozens of cross-party MPs taking the floor in today\u2019s debate to share their strong support for legislation to stop hunters bringing their sick souvenirs back to the UK. We \u2026 look to the House of Lords to ensure swift passage of this vital law,\u201d she said.But others expressed their disappointment and urged the Lords to oppose the law in its current form.\u201cIt is bitterly disappointing MPs have succumbed to an emotive but misinformed animal rights campaign\u201d, said Amy Dickman, an Oxford University professor who is an expert on lion conservation. \u201cThis bill will kill more animals than it will save. Hopes for a rational, evidence-based debate now rest in the House of Lords.\u201dMaxi Pia Louis, a community leader from Namibia, said she was disappointed that the voices of Africans had not been heard. \u201cBritain has ignored our numerous attempts to engage. What is the purpose of the diplomatic ties we supposedly share? This bill will make African communities poorer for many years to come,\u201d she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But after the flooding in Vermont this week, previous weather calamities \u2013 including Tropical Storm Irene, in 2011 \u2013 can offer some clues.Fish in Vermont\u2019s rivers, primarily species of trout \u2013 brook, rainbow and brown \u2013 have been found to move upriver during increased water flow to less turbulent areas, including tributaries or flooded fields, or find refuge behind fallen trees or rocks.Wolverines are the \u2018embodiment of wilderness\u2019. Can they make a US comeback?Read more\u201cThis is definitely unprecedented, but studies of smaller floods show that often fish are not displaced and are in the same pools before and after a flood,\u201d said Will Eldridge, an aquatic habitat biologist with Vermont\u2019s fish and wildlife department. \u201cThey can often survive in place by finding some refuge behind a structure or ride the edges of the flow up into the flood plain.\u201dAfter Hurricane Irene, though, some fish populations fell by 50%, Eldridge says.\u201cBut the silver lining is that fish populations do recover pretty quickly, and they can do that because there is less impact in the headwaters and smaller streams, or they can migrate and recolonize areas that have been impacted,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo we work hard to protect those headwaters and also provide connectivity between streams and systems.\u201dFish are not the only type of wildlife that get displaced. Eldridge\u2019s wife noticed a number of displaced skunks in Montpelier in the immediate aftermath of this week\u2019s flood. They had probably been nesting in the banks of the Winooski River and its tributary streams before they were flooded. Muskrats and weasels, too, were probably displaced.Our wildlife populations in Vermont are really healthy, abundant and sustainable, so they\u2019ll be able to reboundTyler Brown of the Vermont fish and wildlife departmentOne of the most distressing sights around Montpelier in recent days have been the bodies of beavers hit by cars on the roads. Tyler Brown, a wildlife specialist with the department who specializes in beavers and runs the beaver baffle project, which helps to protect beaver-created habitats and studies how their dams can help slow flooding, says the Vermont floods this week will have displaced the beaver population \u2013 but only temporarily.\u201cWhen we get this amount rainfall in so short a time it is likely that beavers will have been displaced from their dams because it\u2019s not likely that a beaver dam could withstand that amount of water,\u201d Brown says. \u201cWhen it comes to normal thunderstorm-type flooding, beaver dams hold and add capacity for capturing water, and allow water to spill over into wetland areas and release it slowly.\u201d But in a catastrophic flood like on Monday, he says, \u201cit depends on where the dams are in the watershed.\u201dWhile it is possible some beavers may have died in the flooding \u2013 there were reports of beavers swimming around during the high-water period of the storm \u2013 Brown predicts the overall population will be just fine.\u201cLike humans, beavers are pretty resilient, so they\u2019re likely already rebuilding to re-create their habitats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will just leave them be and let them figure it out. They know their habitat pretty well, so they\u2019re going to move back to suitable sites in their wetland habitats where there are a lot of young trees \u2013 willows, alders, maples \u2013 to eat the phloem, or inner layer of bark.\u201dOverall, wildlife populations tend to bounce back after flooding events while populations of bears, dear and turkey tend to move temporarily to higher ground.\u201cOur wildlife populations in Vermont are really healthy, abundant and sustainable,\u201d Brown emphasized, \u201cso they\u2019ll be able to rebound.\u201d",

The plan was a shot in the arm for a sector that\u2019s been big on promise but lately lagging in delivery, particularly with 2030 emission targets just a tad more than six years away.Industry and states welcome Albanese government\u2019s plan to jump-start stalled renewables investmentRead moreMyriad challenges remain, though. A lot has to go right if the nation\u2019s main power grid is to get through periods of peak demand \u2013 such as this summer \u2013 without blackouts.As Bowen has noted previously, the pipeline of potential projects has been running in the many gigawatt-levels for years. The Clean Energy Council will soon announce another meagre quarter of ventures reaching final investment decision, adding to recent poor outcomes.Developers single out New South Wales as the state with the most pressing need for new capacity \u2013 and hence, some of the best returns \u2013 but also the hardest in which to get anything approved. The last windfarm to get the nod was almost three years ago.That\u2019s despite the previous Coalition government developing a clean energy roadmap with near unanimous parliamentary support and a Labor energy minister, Penny Sharpe, who is an outspoken supporter of climate action and renewables.The planning department, industry insiders say, could hardly be less helpful, with officials frustratingly hard to meet.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nLast week planning released a draft wind energy guideline that declared much of the state, including two designated renewable energy zones, to be \u201cless suitable\u201d for windfarms. After howls from the sector, the map was summarily tweaked and \u201cless\u201d was dropped, so those areas were suddenly \u201csuitable\u201d.Even though the guideline was a \u201cdraft\u201d, some of the new rules were apparently being enforced, with the department rejecting developers\u2019 visual impact assessments citing updated standards.Landholders, meanwhile, merely have to lodge an application for a structure near a boundary to force a developer to alter the location or numbers of wind towers. Victoria, for instance, won\u2019t accept such \u201chypothetical houses\u201d.And that\u2019s before the issue of getting thousands of kilometres of new transmission built. As one investor noted, without electricity to store, new batteries aren\u2019t much good. Another wondered, are developers supposed to build wind and solar farms where they think power lines might go in?As far as Bowen\u2019s scheme itself goes, many features of its design have merits if the ACT experience is any guide. The so-called \u201ccontracts for difference\u201d do expose taxpayers if wholesale prices fall too low but they also offer windfall gains if they go too high.The ACT\u2019s auctions secured bids in the low $80s per megawatt-hour and later down to the mid $50s per megawatt-hour as technology improved. The scheme cost the budget in the early years and has lately turned over a surplus.Queensland rejects Clive Palmer\u2019s bid to build \u2018carbon neutral\u2019 coal-fired power stationRead moreAuctions held in NSW this year have put solar farm bids at $35/MWh and sub-$50/MWh for wind, the Reneweconomy website has reported.Bruce Mountain, head of the Victoria Energy Policy Institute, said Bowen\u2019s scheme would be hard for a Coalition government to unwind \u2013 unlike, say, an extension of the renewable energy target as some had advocated. \u201cIt\u2019ll be hard to rip up signed contracts but they could stop writing [new ones],\u201d he said.Another issue, though, will be the role of state-owned entities. Bowen\u2019s office has confirmed organisations such as the revived SEC Victoria would be able to make bids, a provision that is not surprising since Queensland and Tasmania\u2019s electricity suppliers have remained mostly in state hands.The commonwealth-owned Snowy Hydro, too, could be among the bidders, potentially creating a conflict of interest, said Dylan McConnell, an energy expert at the University of NSW.The intervention of the federal government was the latest step away from a markets-based solution, he said. It was also proof the market wasn\u2019t delivering decarbonisation of the grid at the pace needed.On the other hand, the commonwealth was in a position to dangle carrots for states doing better and exclude them for laggards, he said.Something for those ministers meeting in Perth to wrangle over.The Guardian sought comment from the planning department.",

Other trustees announced on Friday include Mel Austen, a professor of ocean and society at the University of Plymouth, and Lynn Dicks, who leads a research group working on sustainable agriculture and insect conservation.Questions have been raised over the appropriateness of the appointment, as the former environment secretary previously had to apologise for trying to privatise England\u2019s woodland.Her plans to change the ownership of 258,000 hectares (637,000 acres) of state-owned woodland in 2011 were widely criticised at the time and caused a Tory revolt. She had to take part in a humiliating climbdown in front of fellow MPs. She said at the time: \u201cI have taken a decision to end the consultation on the future of the public forest estate and I take full responsibility for that. I am doing so because it is quite clear from the early responses to the consultation that the public and many honourable members are not happy with the proposals we set out.\u201dThe shadow environment secretary, Jim McMahon, raised questions over the appropriateness of her appointment. \u201cIt appears the conveyor belt of Conservative cronyism is alive and well,\u201d he said.\u201cThe decision to appoint the former secretary of state for the environment who attempted to sell off England\u2019s forests to the board of Natural England raises serious questions of judgment from Defra ministers.\u201cNatural England exists to conserve our natural environment for the benefit of future generations.

The policy was originally drawn up under the previous mayor, Boris Johnson, covering the capital\u2019s central congestion zone. Sadiq Khan extended it in October 2021 to cover most inner boroughs, out to a boundary of the north and south circular roads.How does it work?The oldest, most polluting vehicles have to pay a daily charge to drive in the zone \u2013 \u00a312.50 for cars and more for older coaches and lorries \u2013 although the majority of cars are exempt.Why is it so controversial now?Khan intends to expand it to cover all of Greater London in August. More people in outer London boroughs \u2013 and those living just outside the capital who drive in \u2013 are dependent on cars, with fewer public transport options, and can be charged for essential journeys. Diesel drivers in particular are aggrieved, as some of the non-compliant cars and vans could be less than 10 years old and were once seen as efficient, but are now known to be highly polluting since the dieselgate scandal.How do people know if their vehicle is liable for the charge?They can check it on Transport for London\u2019s website by entering the registration number. Broadly, only petrol cars older than 2005 or diesels registered before 2015 are liable.Why is Khan pressing ahead?He argues that air pollution is a public health emergency, and that there are 4,000 premature deaths a year from toxic air in the capital. Most people in central London do not own cars, and TfL claim that 9 out of 10 cars will not be charged. The significant expansion of Ulez in 2021 has been accepted. Cities around the country have been told they need to enforce clean air zones by the government.What can people do if they own a non-compliant vehicle?London is running a \u00a3110m scrappage scheme which will pay owners of non-compliant cars up to \u00a32,000 if they are on lower incomes or benefits. Sole traders, small businesses and charities can receive up to \u00a39,500 for upgrading vans.

It blamed the decision on a lack of subscribers for the plant\u2019s electricity.The Coalition\u2019s energy and climate spokesperson, Ted O\u2019Brien, has cited NuScale\u2019s technology as part of the opposition\u2019s contentious argument that Australia should lift a national ban on nuclear energy and that small modular reactors (SMRs) could be an affordable replacement for its ageing coal-fired power plants.Australia needs \u2018drastic\u2019 renewables boost as nuclear not an option for decades, says centre-right thinktankRead moreIn an opinion piece in the Australian earlier this year, O\u2019Brien said the company\u2019s integrated reactors, starting with the Idaho plant in 2029, offered \u201cexceptional flexibility\u201d and were an example \u201cof a burgeoning nuclear industry for next-generation technology\u201d in the US.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe climate change minister, Chris Bowen, said SMRs were \u201cthe opposition\u2019s only energy policy\u201d.\u201cThe most advanced prototype in the US has been cancelled. The LNP\u2019s plan for energy security is just more hot air from Peter Dutton,\u201d he said.O\u2019Brien said the minister was \u201cbeating up on zero emissions nuclear energy\u201d because one company had \u201clost a customer\u201d.\u201cIf Bowen was to apply the same faulty logic to all forms of zero-emissions technology, he\u2019d be eliminating every single one of them,\u201d he said, arguing wind, solar and hydro energy developers had suffered cost overruns and delays.\u201cSMR companies are accelerating their development because the world has recognised that we cannot reach net zero without nuclear energy. If Australia is serious about reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 while keeping the lights on and getting prices down, we cannot afford to take any option off the table.\u201dIndustry experts say SMRs are not commercially available, that nuclear energy is more expensive than alternatives and in a best-case scenario could not play a role in Australia for more than a decade, and probably not before 2040. The Australian Energy Market Operator found renewable energy could be providing 96% of the country\u2019s electricity by that time.The Coalition opposes Labor\u2019s goal of reaching 82% renewable electricity by 2030. It has argued for a slower response to the climate crisis and amplified local concerns about new clean energy and electricity transmission connections.Australia urgently needs a grid upgrade \u2013 but the march of new power lines faces a bush revoltRead moreThe projected cost of the NuScale project had blown out from US$3.6bn for 720 megawatts in 2020 to US$9.3bn for 462MW last year. It had received about US$600m in government funding, but failed after securing subscriptions for only 20% of the required capital from a Utah-based consortium of electricity companies. NuScale\u2019s share price fell nearly 30% after the announcement.Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court, a clean energy advocate and commentator and convener of political fundraising body Climate 200, said the estimated capital cost of the Idaho project before it was cancelled was 70% higher than CSIRO projections of what nuclear power plants could cost to build in 2030.He said this undermined arguments by the Coalition and other nuclear advocates, who had accused the CSIRO of exaggerating the likely cost of nuclear energy.Holmes \u00e0 Court said Australia needed a rapid rollout of solar, wind and energy storage. He recently toured nuclear power projects in the US.\u201cThe simple fact is that commercial SMRs don\u2019t exist. There are zero in operation or even contracted for construction outside Russia and China. The cancellation of one of the three leading proposals underscores the speculative nature of this far-off technology,\u201d he said.\u201cMore than two thirds of our coal generators will retire in the next decade due to age. By pushing a unicorn technology the Coalition is posing a threat to the cost and security of Australia\u2019s electricity grid.\u201d This article was amended on 9 November 2023 to correct the initial projected megawatt capacity from 7,200 to 720.",

This is despite the government having promised at the Cop26 climate conference in 2021 to implement the rules.The Environment Act 2021 established a ban on the use of commodities produced on illegally deforested land abroad, but this has not come into force because Defra has failed to publish the list of the commodities covered by the regime.The former environment minister Zac Goldsmith said: \u201cWe passed the Environment Act with much fanfare, not least so we could present ourselves as a world leader at Cop26 \u2026 and it was a genuinely landmark law to cut illegal deforestation caused by commodity production from our supply chains.

So the government needs to stop with the delays and U-turns and get on with it.\u201dAn investigation by Global Witness and Trase has found the UK is still importing seven commodities associated with deforestation including palm oil, soy and cattle products.Of the estimated total 20,400 hectares (50,400 acres) of deforestation linked to UK imports between November 2021 and July 2023, 8,800 hectares were estimated to be linked to palm oil, 3,470 hectares to soy, and 2,950 hectares to cattle products.The researchers said these numbers were likely to be underestimates because they included raw commodities rather than processed products that contained the ingredients, such as chocolate.Campaigners also said the UK\u2019s regime was weaker than that of the EU, which covered deforestation and forest degradation. The UK\u2019s ban covers only illegal deforestation.Veronica Oakeshott, the head of the forest campaign at Global Witness, said: \u201cFor two years, the government has been dithering about which deforestation-causing commodities to include in these regulations. In this time, tropical forests have continued to be destroyed to grow crops and graze cattle. And some of that product ends up for sale in the UK. This delay is tainting the UK public\u2019s products \u2013 from the beef on our dinner plates to the palm oil in our shampoo.She said the government should listen to UK retailers and fully align with the EU\u2019s deforestation regulation, which covered all forest-risk commodities.Oakeshott added: \u201cIt is outrageous that Defra is failing to press the green light on simple regulations needed to stop the UK importation of forest destruction. If the UK wants to be seen as climate leader, it must act now.\u201dA Defra spokesperson said: \u201cThe vast majority deforestation for commercial agriculture is conducted in violation of laws in producer countries, which is why our Environment Act includes world-leading due diligence legislation to help tackle this illegal activity and to rid these products from UK retail shelves. We will be setting out our next steps imminently.\u201d\u201cOur approach is based on partnership with producer countries and will reinforce the efforts of governments in producer countries to ensure sustainable forest and land use.\u201d",

Work also started on 19 big batteries with 1,380MW/2,004MWh capacity, or almost half as large again as the previous record year in 2021, the council said.Households also joined in the renewables rush, with 310,000 new solar systems with a capacity of 2,700MW added to rooftops. While down on 2021\u2019s record of 3,300MW, the extra capacity increased the share of total renewable energy on rooftops to 25.8%.Victorian government urges more investment in renewables as revived SEC won\u2019t be enough to reach targetRead moreRenewables supplied 35.9% of Australia\u2019s total electricity generation last year, up from just under 17% in 2017, the report said.While there was a \u201csignificant cause for optimism at a time when ageing fossil fuel-based generators are retiring\u201d, the speed of renewables\u2019 advance needed to double to meet the federal government\u2019s 2030 target, said the Clean Energy Council\u2019s chief executive, Kane Thornton. The emissions target implies an 82% reduction in the sector\u2019s pollution compared with 2005 levels.\u201c2022 was a good year for projects under construction but a slower year for projects reaching financial close,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cWhatever way you look at it, we have to accelerate it.\u201dThe renewables sector has been buoyed up by a closer alignment of federal and state policy since the election of the Albanese government. But a more interventionist approach by some states into the power sector was creating a new form of uncertainty for investors, he said.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThornton said expanded, extended renewable energy targets would be one way to bolster the industry.

New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia all drew about a third of their power from clean energy, while Queensland lagged at 22.6%.For rooftop solar, the second half of 2022 provided a sharp upturn in demand after supply and labour shortages, and poor weather quelled growth in the first six months. Only the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania set installation levels above 2021\u2019s record year.The average size of installed solar systems continues to grow, rising from 8.79kW in 2021 to 8.84kW last year.Thornton said 2023 was expected to be \u201canother strong year\u201d for rooftop solar, noting that projected power cost increases of another 30% in some regions from July will keep \u201cthe focus on electricity prices\u201d and spur more consumers to buy panels.",

However, Stuart said the CCC had found aspects of climate policy that were improving.A group of more than 80 countries, including the UK, called for the phaseout of fossil fuels at the Cop27 UN climate summit in Egypt last year, and are expected to make the same demand at Cop28 in Dubai.However, Stuart\u2019s comments to the committee raised questions over whether the UK would take such a strong position this year.He told MPs: \u201cThere is nothing fundamentally wrong with oil and gas, it\u2019s emissions from oil and gas that are the problem and that we must focus on.\u201dFocusing on emissions rather than fossil fuels is regarded as a distraction by many campaigners, or as cover for relying on technology for carbon capture and storage, which is not yet used at scale and may never be.View image in fullscreenNeet zero minister Graham Stuart.Jamie Peters, climate coordinator at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThank goodness Graham Stuart has enlightened us that there are no fundamental problems with continuing to back oil and gas, because it\u2019s only the government\u2019s own climate advisers, the International Energy Agency and the world\u2019s top scientists who\u2019ve strongly stated otherwise.\u201dAmi McCarthy, political campaigner at Greenpeace UK, called Stuart\u2019s remarks \u201claughable\u201d.They said: \u201cThis government is completely failing on both supply and demand. It scrapped its own energy efficiency taskforce that was established to reduce demand through schemes like insulating our heat-leaking homes and upgrading boilers.\u201cTo put the blame on demand from consumers, who have been left unsupported by this government, is a new low for a Conservative party who are hell-bent on attempting to weaponise climate action to sow division.\u201dRobbie MacPherson, political lead at the campaigning group Uplift, said the government was not a world leader on the climate while it was pursuing the expansion of fossil fuels.\u201cGreenlighting fields like Rosebank tells the world that the UK cannot be trusted in phasing out fossil fuels at exactly the time we need the world to come together at Cop28 to make progress on this issue,\u201d he said.\u201cThe UK has been and can again be a world leader in reducing emissions but for that to happen the government must rapidly end its political gameplaying on oil and gas.\u201d This article was amended on 9 November 2023 to correct some personal information.",

I will never be able to happily anticipate the season again. Instead, I will dread its heat \u2013 although not as much as those in unliveable places where lives are being destroyed by fire and floods. That is why Rishi Sunak\u2019s dog-whistle weakening of already pitifully inadequate action on the climate emergency is despicable and deadly (Rishi Sunak announces U-turn on key green targets, 20 September).I am one of those this policy change is designed to appeal to. The cost of living hits me hard and I live month to month. There\u2019s no way I can replace my ageing hybrid with an electric car. A heat pump is an impossible dream even if I didn\u2019t live in private rented accommodation. But this pretence of caring about people like me is a cynical betrayal of what really matters. If Sunak really wanted to make our lives better then he would act faster on net zero and give us a true green new deal. Bel Greenwood Norwich I\u2019m writing to express my anger, as a 17-year-old, at Rishi Sunak making the political choice to drop net zero policies. It will impact every single one of us. This is desperate populism from a desperate party willing to risk the lives of future generations to secure another term in office.What will \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d say to China or a Trump-led US when they also conclude that they have done enough to slow global warming? Sunak\u2019s willingness to throw a spanner in the works of global green policy to chase a few points in the polls shows Zac Goldsmith was right: he is \u201csimply uninterested\u201d in the future of our planet. Milo Sanders Royston, Hertfordshire While it is of course important that we reach net zero, what is more important is how much more CO2 is released before we get there. It is the cumulative emissions over those years that will determine quite how disastrous global heating will be in the decades to come. This is why cutting our emissions as much and as quickly as possible is so much more important than the actual date when net zero is achieved. Unfortunately, in reiterating his commitment to reaching net zero by 2050, while relaxing measures to cut emissions soon, Rishi Sunak shows us he just doesn\u2019t get this. Jeremy Wight Chair, Hope Valley Climate Action Born and bred in the UK, and having lived in France for many years, I was surprised \u2013 to put it mildly \u2013 that Rishi Sunak chose to announce his U-turn on climate targets on the same day that King Charles, on a state visit to France, made a strong appeal for climate action (Report, 21 September). One can only deplore this latest manifestation of \u201cperfide Albion\u201d: infighting on an international stage, with the inevitable loss of credibility for the country. Charles Wilhelm Besan\u00e7on, France So the prime minister is taking a middle road between those who want far tougher climate action and those who do not believe humans are causing climate breakdown at all. Perhaps when he takes his next helicopter jaunt he should try steering a course based half on the idea the world is round and half that it\u2019s flat. The result is likely to be just as disastrous as his climate policy.

        "text": "The UK\u2019s peat bogs are remarkable. Apart from their damp beauty, they are home to rare wildlife, act as a water filter and a ballast against flooding, and, perhaps most crucially of all, are a somewhat unsung hero of the battle with the climate crisis given their carbon-capturing power. Peat bogs are Scotland\u2019s largest carbon store.That combination of attributes means peatlands have long been an environmental cause celebre, and explains why even this most part-time, pallidly green of governments has at last seen a reason to protect them, with the most high-profile piece of legislation so far being a ban on peat products for domestic gardeners, which will see composting products \u2013 already pretty much infra dig \u2013 entirely absent from garden centres by the end of 2024.It\u2019s also why the scotch whisky industry is starting to feel a little nervous about how long its own relationship with peat can continue. Don\u2019t forget, whisky and peat go back centuries together, a partnership which, for lovers of a peaty dram, is as precious and remarkable as anything else to do with peat: when barley is malted above a peat fire, it gives the resulting whisky that distinctive, damp-earthy-smoky flavour which many would argue is the quintessence of scotch.As well as making the point that whisky accounts for only about 1% of the UK\u2019s peat use, defending the cultural significance of this tradition has been the central pillar of the scotch industry\u2019s case during the Scottish government\u2019s consultation on its peat policy this year. Pledges to make peat use more sustainable have also been part of the lobbying mix \u2013 although the idea that peat use can ever be truly sustainable given the glacial pace of regeneration (1mm a year) is a matter of some debate.Would an outright ban on industrial peat use in the short or medium term, which some producers fear may be the result of the consultation, spell the end of scotch as we know it?Dank, ancient and quite fantastic: Scotland\u2019s peat bogs breathe againRead moreWell, apart from the fact that many whiskies have always have been \u201cunpeated\u201d (the elegant style of distilleries in Speyside, for example, that use unpeated barley), some makers have been experimenting with methods of replacing or reducing peat in their fuller-flavoured whiskies by using other aromatic fuels during kilning. These include juniper, birch bark, heather and alder wood. Some are even experimenting with biochar (a high carbon form of charcoal) and sheep dung, while others are using smokier, toastier barrels for ageing. None can ever quite replace the uniquely evocative hit of peat smoke. But between them they are likely to play an ever bigger role in shaping the flavours of whisky at a time when an increasing number of peat-lovers are looking to put planet before palate.Five unpeated whiskies and one with just \u2018a little peat\u2019Bruichladdich Classic Laddie Islay Single Malt Whisky (from \u00a336, Morrisons, Tesco, Waitrose)The island of Islay in the Inner Hebrides is known for its uncompromisingly peaty-smoky whiskies.

        "text": "The more than 700 pledges that emerged from the UN water conference, which concluded last weekend, were an insufficient response to the worsening global water crisis. But the scientific panel that the UN has committed to create, along with a new water envoy, should help bring greater clarity and raise awareness of the multiplying risks. These include sea level rises, floods, droughts and other extreme weather caused by global heating, and the lack of access of about 2 billion people to clean drinking water. The trouble is that the commitments made by attenders \u2013 who included very few world leaders \u2013 are voluntary and unenforceable. Given the broken climate pledges of the past, there is every reason to worry that the promises will not be kept.Many participants in the three days of talks in New York were angered by the prominent role played by corporations, including manufacturers who are heavy users of water, and the lack of representation of grassroots organisations from the poorer countries that are the worst affected. As with recent reports of the influence of oil companies in US universities, there are growing concerns about the ways in which businesses are seeking to shape environmental legislation, and public understanding of the threats, to promote their own short-term economic interests.Nonetheless, the UN\u2019s first major conference on water since 1977 was a reminder that scarce resources must not be taken for granted. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, warned that it is \u201cmaking our planet uninhabitable\u201d and that \u201cvampiric overconsumption\u201d must stop. Last year\u2019s drought in Somalia, which is estimated to have caused 43,000 excess deaths, and floods in Pakistan, are grim foretastes of what lies ahead. About 10% of the global rise in migration is linked to water shortages, and armed conflict linked to competition for water is also increasing.There are good reasons why dangerous heat tends to be the focus when we think about the climate emergency. Rising temperatures caused by greenhouse gases are the central problem \u2013 and one which continues to become more dangerous as emissions keep rising. But limiting emissions is only one part of the solution to an emergency that is certain to get worse, even if we eventually succeed in preventing the most catastrophic outcomes. Rising sea levels are the urgent priority of low-lying and island nations that could disappear under the waves.Food production and energy generation are both highly water-intensive. The last century of development saw freshwater withdrawal rates rise almost sixfold. Now it is poorer nations driving demand. Yet a quarter of the world\u2019s population still does not have access to safe drinking water, while half lacks basic sanitation \u2013 which is one of the sustainable development goals for 2030.Belatedly, the need to improve water governance, and ensure fairer distribution as well as conservation, is on the wider environmental agenda. But, as with every aspect of the climate crisis, the response lags behind reality. The continuing trend towards privatisation of water supplies is concerning, as is the lack of financial transfers from rich countries. There was some good news: a UN report released just before the conference noted that, globally, water use efficiency had risen by 9% from 2015 to 2018. Richard Connor, the report\u2019s author, warned that \u201cbinding agreements\u201d were needed, rather than setting global targets that could be ignored and hence never reached. On current performance, Mr Connor looks to be right.",

It has suggested the government considers offering more support this winter.More than 46,400 people asked Citizens Advice for support in the first six months of this year, marking a 17% rise compared with the same period last year.On average, those contacting the charity had about \u00a31,711 worth of unpaid energy bills, with analysis showing disabled people and families with young children were the most likely to be struggling with high levels of debt.The sector regulator, Ofgem, recently estimated that the collective gas and electricity debt owed by UK consumers was about \u00a32.3bn. Nearly 8 million people had to borrow money to pay their energy bills in the first half of 2023, a number Citizens Advice expects to rise over the coming months.On Friday Ofgem will announce a new energy price cap, which forecasters have predicted will keep the typical annual household bill at the equivalent of about \u00a31,823 from October, although much of that change will be the result of a new formula that assumes lower gas and electricity usage. Under the current formula, the cap will be equivalent to \u00a31,925.However, that cap level will still mean the about 29 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland that it applies to are paying roughly 40% more than they were two years ago, before supplies were disrupted by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.With households not entitled to the \u00a3400 support they received last winter, split into monthly payments between October and April, Citizens Advice warned that millions of people were facing a winter as bad as last winter, or even worse.The charity predicts that by the end of this year it will have seen 26% more people in need of help with energy debts, compared with 2022. It says the number of people already seeking support has nearly doubled in four years.\u201cWhat we saw last winter must never be repeated,\u201d the charity\u2019s chief executive, Clare Moriarty, said. \u201cStruggling households unable to pay their energy bills, people unable to top up their prepayment meter and record numbers coming to us for crisis support.\u201cWith increasing numbers of people we help facing a negative budget, where they simply don\u2019t have enough to cover their essential bills, there is a real risk this winter will be worse.

Photograph: John Gaffen/AlamyIt recommends that councils try to reach out better to communities ahead of future projects and seek to depoliticise the issue, with one idea being to use a different term from LTN, one not associated with the wave of schemes introduced in 2020, such as \u201chealthy neighbourhoods\u201d or \u201cquiet neighbourhoods\u201d.The report only covers London, but has lessons for other areas given that the capital has seen the bulk of recent LTNs implemented, as well as much of the political controversy about their impact.Data collated from 10 schemes in the report found that inside their boundaries, cycle use rose by between 31% and 172%, while car traffic fell by between 22% and 76%. There was also strong evidence they reduced road casualties.One frequent criticism of LTNs is that they simply push car use to the periphery, to busier main roads. The study found some evidence of rising cycling numbers outside the LTNs, while car use also mainly fell slightly, although one area saw a 7% increase.But overall, the authors said, the evidence on possible traffic displacement was mixed. They said the best thing would be to continue with LTNs but to also introduce complementary measures such as road pricing and protected cycle lanes.They also said they had found no evidence that LTNs slowed down emergency vehicle response times, or that the schemes disproportionately benefited wealthier areas, saying people living inside LTN boundaries tended to have a similar demographic profile to those on boundary roads.GraphicWhile the basic idea of filtering residential streets to limit rat-running traffic has existed in various forms for decades, the rush of Covid-era LTNs caused the issue to become highly politicised, notably in London, with protest groups springing up.Among a series of recommendations, the report said councils should try to make schemes as comprehensive as possible so as to limit traffic displacement, and try to make them appealing by adding elements such as benches and wider pavements.To keep locals onside, it added, local authorities could allow a grace period before fining people for breaching LTN rules, and reach out to more groups, but also be \u201cdiscerning\u201d about whether people who claimed to represent significant numbers of opponents genuinely did.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7am BSTThe report made plain the wider need for action, noting that while overall car ownership in London had declined in recent years, a combination of satnav apps, Uber-type cabs and more home deliveries meant the number of miles driven on the capital\u2019s minor roads had almost doubled in the decade from 2009.Nicolas Bosetti from Centre for London, the report\u2019s lead author, said the evidence showed LTNs could be effective, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t mean they should be done on the cheap\u201d.He said: \u201cThey should also be complemented by additional measures that discourage driving private cars and provide practical alternatives for both short and long journeys.

        "text": "Recently, my family welcomed a new arrival. This event was keenly anticipated. We had watched it grow, fretted over its development. And then suddenly, there it was, sitting in the kitchen: a bright orange pumpkin, about the size of my head and equally as weirdly shaped. While I was thrilled to see it, I can take none of the credit for its production. The farmer was my wife, Pat, who fretted appropriately over the way the pumpkin plant clearly shut down all other production to bring forth this one beauty. A reasonably productive tomato plant kept it company. We also got a couple of chillies from a tiny seedling brought to the house by a lunch guest. Tom and Barbara Good had nothing on us.For a while we fretted over what to do with the pumpkin. We thought about carving it into a lantern for Halloween but in truth we\u2019ve opted out of being mugged by children for sugar. Ours are adults. We\u2019re done. Round our way if you don\u2019t put out a pumpkin, the door knocker stays unmolested. So we thought about roasting and even pickling it.But mostly, we admired it. Two thoughts occurred to me, the first of which is obvious. But because I\u2019m a cynical, dreary, hammer-faced excuse for a human it took me by surprise. Growing food at home is marvellous. It\u2019s engrossing. It turns any outdoor space into something functional rather than just ornamental. And the second thought? It\u2019s a terrible way to produce fruit and veg. Awful. Cataclysmically bad. The effort that went into producing that pumpkin was hilariously huge.Does this mean I think people shouldn\u2019t grow their own? No, quite the reverse. We need to keep reminding ourselves just how difficult it is to keep a mass population fed, and what a brilliant job large-scale agriculture does. And the best way to do that is by trying to mimic it at home. There will, of course, be some people with burgeoning allotments and home veg patches who will be chuntering at this. Just because the Rayner family can\u2019t do much of a job doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t work. Indeed, it must be lovely to sit down regularly to a meal nurtured and harvested by your own hand. The problem is that environmentally it doesn\u2019t quite stack up.A decade ago, while working on a book about food and sustainability, I was introduced to the concept of whole life cycle analysis (LCA). Using an LCA means that when you talk about the footprint of food production you can\u2019t just consider the fertilisers or the fuel used to transport the food produced. You must include the carbon in any tools and machinery, in the fencing and the irrigation and in the lifestyles of the people involved. Did you drive to the allotment? Oh. Then you divide that by yield.As a result, when it comes to growing stuff even the most productive home effort will never compete with a large-scale arable or vegetable farm\u2019s production. None of this is to excuse the worst excesses of industrial agriculture. Running to the margins in a discussion like this doesn\u2019t help anyone.But the reality is that feeding a population of more than 60 million is always going to be dependent on mass agriculture which, done right, has a better chance of being carbon efficient. And curiously a very good way of doing this is to remind ourselves just how hard it is by attempting to produce significant amounts ourselves. We\u2019re certainly going to have another crack at it next year. It will be brilliant. It will also be pathetic. By the way, we turned our pumpkin into soup. It was very nice.",

In the case of the Townsville graffiti removal from military remnants, Box said the relevant work that should have been listed as having been funded was habitat restoration, including introducing 5,000 plants.Box said the projects listed on the 236-page document were funded through several different programs, including Landcare, the Green Army, the 20 Million Trees program, the National Environmental Science Programme and some targeted threatened species projects. In each case, the applicants seeking funding had said their work would protect threatened species, and their application was assessed against the program\u2019s criteria.Department officials were asked how generic environment projects funded through the Green Army and 20 Million Trees programs, such as street tree planting in Penrith, would benefit threatened species.

An upper-level low will move slowly east across the US, while at lower levels an area of low pressure moves north-east from the central Rockies towards the Great Lakes.Warm, moist air is expected to be drawn northward through much of the eastern half of the US.

There was a mini heatwave last weekend, with temperatures in the south pole above -40C for more than two days and reaching a high of -33C. Though shy of the record high for March, this was 20 degrees above the seasonal average of -53.7C. Daily highs exceeded -40C once again this weekend. The cause of the unusually high temperatures is thought to be variations in the path of the southern polar jet stream \u2013 a rapid air current flowing around the Antarctic region \u2013 driving parcels of warm and moist air farther south than normal. Antarctic heatwaves are uncommon but are occurring more frequently as the climate warms. Antarctic sea temperatures are unusually warm this year, with in recent months some of the lowest sea ice levels ever recorded, and this could be another contributing factor to the heatwave.

        "text": "The EU has announced further plans to crack down on microplastics after its ban on glitter came into force.The proposal, which tackles tiny pellets used in nearly all plastic products, aims to cut plastic pellet pollution by 74% by the end of the decade. Overall, it would lead to a 7% reduction in Europe\u2019s microplastic pollution, according to the European Commission.\u201cThe most important thing is to cut pollution at the source,\u201d said Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius, EU commissioner for the environment, oceans and fisheries, in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cWhat we are looking to do is basically ensure we drastically cut, at the source, pollution of microplastics.\u201dTiny, durable pellets of plastic \u2013 also known as nurdles or nibs \u2013 are melted down and reformed into everyday products, from office chairs to water bottles. But they leak into the environment at every stage of the supply chain.Over time, they break down into microplastics that are eaten and drunk by people and animals. The commission estimates between 52,000 and 184,000 tons of plastic pellets are released into the environment in the EU each year.Glitter sales surge in Germany before EU microplastics ban this weekRead moreDana K\u00fchnel, from the Helmholtz-Centre for Environmental Research, said: \u201cPreventing plastic release is much more effective than managing microplastics.\u201dAs part of its push to cut microplastic pollution 30% by 2030, the commission wants operators who handle pellets to take precautions that keep them from harming nature. In order of importance, it wants them to prevent spills, contain spills that do happen, and clean up after spills that are not contained.The proposal includes best handling practices for operators and mandatory certifications from an independent third party. But smaller operators will simply be allowed to \u201cself declare\u201d that they have complied with the rules.\u201cThere are lighter requirements for small and medium-sized enterprises to reduce the economic burden,\u201d said Sinkevi\u010dius.On Sunday a separate ban on some products that contain microplastics, like glitter and other cosmetics, came into force. The move caused panic among influencers and led to an increase in sales in Germany.Scientists and doctors have long warned that the rising tide of microplastics could hurt human health as they pile up in the body. Plastic pellets are not small enough to cause much damage to people in their original form but break down into tiny pieces that can pass into the lungs and bloodstream.Eleonore Fr\u00f6hlich, from the Medical University of Graz, said: \u201cGreat parts of the respiratory tract are covered with a thin layer of cells and only little mucus, which makes this barrier more permeable and vulnerable than the gastrointestinal tract and the skin.\u201cIn this respect, the regulation will be more effective than the ban on intentionally added microplastic to consumer products that mainly contact the skin \u2013 which is a protective and less permeable barrier of the human body.\u201dThe proposal will now be discussed by the European parliament and council.Global microplastic pollution is set to double by 2040 if no action is taken, according to a report from the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts.Siegfried Schmuck, who works on ocean conservation for Pew, said: \u201cIndustry best practice measures already exist but they have been voluntary for more than three decades with little uptake.\u201cThe EU Commission\u2019s proposal means we now have the chance to hold industry accountable by making these mandatory \u2013 and effectively reduce the third-largest source of microplastic pollution in the EU.\u201d",

        "text": "Illegal tree felling in England will be punishable by unlimited fines and prison sentences from 1 January, the government has announced.The current fine for cutting down a tree without a licence, established by the Forestry Act 1967, is \u00a32,500 or twice the value of the timber, whichever is the higher.But the development value of the land, as opposed to the price of timber, has been the main driver of illegal felling in recent years.To deter property barons from illegally flattening trees and accepting the paltry penalties as a cost of doing business, the Forestry Act 1967 will be amended by the Environment Act to allow uncapped fines. The Environment Act passed into law in November 2021, although its provisions against illegal tree felling are not yet in force.Under existing laws, illegally felling 12 oak trees, all about 150 years old, attracted a fine of just \u00a315,000 in January 2020. The case, prosecuted at Hastings magistrates court, was remarkable for resulting in one of the biggest fines in recent years.\u201cThese new powers will hit people where it hurts \u2013 in their wallets,\u201d said the Forestry Commission\u2019s chief executive, Richard Stanford. \u201cBy guaranteeing that illegal felling is no longer a financially viable option for offenders, these measures are a significant step forward in the fight against this offence and will help in our endeavours to fight the climate emergency and nature crisis.\u201dThe changes also mean a failure to replant illegally felled trees after a court\u2019s restocking order could result in a prison sentence.Selling land developed through illegal felling will also be made less lucrative, with restocking notices and enforcement notices listed on the local land charges register \u2013 potentially reducing the land\u2019s value in the eyes of buyers.But critics question whether the harsh penalties will be meted out often enough to be an effective deterrent. Last month the Guardian revealed only 15 of 4,002 alleged illegal felling cases reported to the Forestry Commission resulted in a successful conviction between 2012-13 to 2021-22.The Forestry Commission, a non-ministerial government department, said its count of alleged wrongdoing is inflated by members of the public misreporting. Exemptions apply in the majority of cases flagged up, relating to factors such as the timber volume, the diameter of the tree and its location.Local planning authorities already have the power to issue tree protection orders (TPOs), with those who breach them facing unlimited fines if the case is serious enough to be tried at the crown court. Earlier this year, a case prosecuted by Eastleigh borough council resulted in a \u00a350,000 fine for a landowner who illegally felled a number of trees within Scorey\u2019s Copse, including oak, ash, birch, hawthorn and poplar.From 1 January 2023, even trees without TPOs could land illegal fellers with an unlimited fine, if chopped down without a licence outside of qualifying exemptions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

These changes should send a clear message that felling trees illegally, for example prior to submitting development proposals, will not be tolerated, and that the penalties reflect the value and many benefits trees bring to our towns and cities.\u201cIt is important that this is backed by increased resources for the organisations that deal with the enforcement of illegal felling.\u201d",

Why should they carry on dying prematurely in numbers that could be reversed?\u201dKhan told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme it was a \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to expand the zone, but a vital one, explaining that in London 4,000 premature deaths a year were linked directly to air pollution.He said the policy was proven to be effective in central London, where it had led to a 50% reduction in the main air pollutants and a third fewer children being admitted to hospital with air-pollution-related illnesses, while the further expansion to inner London resulted in a reduction of 21% of the main pollutants.The mayor told Times Radio that nine out of 10 cars driving in outer London were already compliant and would not be subject to any of the new fees. \u201cThe policy to clean the air in London is not anti-car or anti-motorist,\u201d he said.He also revealed that Transport for London (TfL) had received more than 15,000 applications for its Ulez scrappage scheme in the past week.

In May 2020, the then transport secretary, Grant Shapps, wrote to Khan asking him to \u201curgently bring forward proposals to widen the scope and levels of\u201d the congestion charge.However, the current transport secretary, Mark Harper, said he would stop the expansion of London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) if he had the power to do so. Asked if he would halt the expansion, Harper told GB News: \u201cYes. I don\u2019t have the power, though.\u201dThe Ulez expansion has been blamed for Labour\u2019s failure to win last month\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip byelection.To comply with Ulez standards, petrol cars must generally have been first registered after 2005, while most diesel cars registered after September 2015 are also exempt from the charge.A government spokesperson said: \u201cBoth transport and air quality are devolved to London, which is why they are the direct responsibility of the mayor of London. In fact, the government has provided TfL \u00a36bn since 2020 to keep public transport moving and almost \u00a3102m for projects specifically targeted to help tackle air pollution.\u201d",

Fish, plants, native crayfish and birds may take years to make a gradual return to previous populations.Speaking after the verdict, Emma Johnson, the area manager for Natural England, said: \u201cThe destruction of this section of the River Lugg was devastating for the abundance and range of species which thrived in this river.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They tell our reporters the facts, explain the science, and warn of what is to come. But when governments and corporations still don\u2019t act with the urgency and ambition required, it feels like words are in danger of losing their power.As journalists, this is, of course, concerning. Our role is to communicate what is happening in the world, and why it matters, in the public interest. On the climate and nature crisis, the science is clear. We are on track for a \u201chellish\u201d 3C of global heating, the UN has warned ahead of the Cop28 UN climate summit that begins this week. We have to stop burning fossil fuels, and stop destroying the natural world. Yet still, we dither and delay. Another fossil fuel project is signed off. Another forest felled. More wildlife pushed to extinction.That is why at the Guardian we are committed to continuing to put our climate and nature reporting at the front and centre of everything we do. We have long pioneered this approach \u2013 giving our reporting on the living world more space, prominence and resources than any other media organisation. As well as covering the science of the escalating crisis, we also interrogate the power structures and political and corporate interests that so often stand in the way of meaningful action, and foreground the people fighting for real change.This has, in turn, inspired us to take a closer look at our own organisation: from, in 2020, no longer accepting advertising from fossil fuel companies, to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. Today, we publish our first ever biodiversity audit, to measure our impact on nature and how to reduce it.The Guardian knows that the climate and nature crisis are linked, and in recent years, we have increased our coverage of catastrophic plant and wildlife loss and ecosystem collapse, with reporters dedicated to this beat. We also know that when the climate and nature crisis strikes, it is often those least responsible for it who are the hardest hit \u2013 so we have reporters focused on issues of climate justice, and how to reduce emissions while also tackling other inequalities.Our growing team of specialist reporters are based around the world, from the UK to the US, Australia to Brussels and the Amazon rainforest. In the past 12 months, we have covered the big climate and nature summits, and most important scientific papers. We\u2019ve pursued investigations into the polluter elite, carbon offsetting, methane leaks, the destruction of habitats and attacks on environmental defenders. We\u2019ve reported on local campaigns to give people the right to roam in green spaces and tracked the health of everything from spiders to orcas and Antarctic sea ice. We\u2019ve shined a light on individuals who have died as a result of climate catastrophe, covered a groundbreaking climate lawsuit brought by young plaintiffs and attended a deforestation meeting in the heart of the rainforest with a legendary Indigenous leader. We have examined the long history of man\u2019s destructive relationship with nature, exposed those deliberately preventing progress for financial gain, and shared some of the solutions.All this takes time and resources. Investigations can involve months of painstaking work, protecting sources, analysing data and travelling to the frontline of the crisis to document the human impact of decisions that, all too often, are made in remote and secretive corporate boardrooms. It is work that frequently involves teams of lawyers \u2013 an unfortunate necessity when taking on some of the most powerful and profitable companies in the world.The only way any of this is possible is through the support of our readers. The Guardian does not have any billionaire backers. Our unique ownership model means we are beholden to nobody. But it also means we depend on you.We all can \u2013 and must \u2013 do more. So we\u2019ll keep reporting. One thing you can do today is support the Guardian\u2019s journalism.",

Photograph: J Haber/UN BiodiversityLess than a year after governments agreed this decade\u2019s targets to halt the destruction of the natural world, Cooper said that while meeting some climate and biodiversity targets required short-term tradeoffs, they were vital for maintaining a habitable planet now and in the future.\u201cI don\u2019t accept that the public mood as a whole is moving against the environment. The public as a whole, and particularly young people, see this as more and more important,\u201d said Cooper.\u201cWe see some backtracking in different parts of the world but a lot of this is political groups trying to find wedge issues to gain a marginal advantage in an upcoming election,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the public are allowed to express their views, they come up with good decisions.\u201dHe cited the recent citizens\u2019 assembly on biodiversity in Ireland and the vote in Ecuador against continuing with oil and gas exploration in the Amazon rainforest as moments when the public had pushed for stronger environmental protections.\u201cPeople are actually ahead of the governments. We must not allow ourselves to be persuaded that there is a pushback by the public as a whole,\u201d he said.Cooper said he accepted there were sometimes costs in the short term to environmental policies, but said governments should work with communities who felt threatened to find a way forward.Flagship EU law to restore nature must not be derailed, warns environment chiefRead more\u201c[The pushback] is partly led by politicians speaking to their base and \u2026 vested interests that will do what they can to deny some of the issues we\u2019re facing in climate change, biodiversity loss and the like,\u201d Cooper added.\u201cThe goals and targets of these environmental agreements are ambitious.

Last November, the government granted staff a 2% pay rise, but their trade union, Unison, says since 2010 its members\u2019 salaries have fallen by more than 20% in real terms.One EA incident response worker told the Guardian that colleagues felt forced into taking action by the government\u2019s refusal to move on pay.

Terms such as \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d, \u201cnature positive\u201d and those concerned with offsetting are to undergo greater scrutiny by organisations such as the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK. In order to take meaningful action, agencies must also reconsider their relationships with major polluters, industry insiders have said.\u201cThe era of unspecific claims such as \u2018environmentally friendly\u2019 is over,\u201d said Jonny White, senior business director at AMV BBDO, which works with companies including Diageo, Unilever and Bupa. \u201cMisleading environmental claims are under the microscope from advertising regulators, consumer watchdogs and even governments. The risks of getting it wrong are huge, with brands being shamed publicly when they are guilty of misleading the public,\u201d he said.UK advertising watchdog to crack down on carbon offsetting claimsRead moreCreative members of advertising agencies are having to work closely with their legal teams when advising clients on their climate claims, insiders have said, with an increased risk of fines and advert bans in some countries.In the UK, the Ad Net Zero programme was launched in 2020 in a bid to reduce the carbon impact of the advertising industry\u2019s operations to net zero by 2030, but many agencies are developing in-house teams for sustainability-focused campaigns.\u201cIn many client organisations, there is still a big gap between the marketing and sustainability teams. They have different, often competing objectives, and are accountable in very different ways,\u201d said Ben Essen, global chief strategy officer at the global marketing agency Iris Worldwide, which works with firms such as Adidas, Starbucks and Samsung, and is also doing the campaign for Cop26.Essen said there is an \u201cinherent tension\u201d between the need to engage audiences through \u201coften hyperbolic stories\u201d and the need for sustainability teams to deal in the substance.On Thursday, the European parliament voted to ban claims of carbon neutrality that are based on offsetting. The EU environment commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius, said firms would face greater scrutiny about their claims with offsets, but stopped short of supporting a ban, given their potential to fund climate crisis mitigation.\u201cClimate-related claims have been shown to be particularly prone to being unclear and ambiguous, misleading the consumer. Claims like \u2018climate neutral\u2019, \u2018carbon neutral\u2019, \u2018100% CO2 compensated\u2019 and \u2018net zero\u2019 are very often based on offsetting. We need to set things straight for consumers and give them full information,\u201d he said.Blake Harrop, president of Wieden+Kennedy Amsterdam, which works with Airbnb, Meta and Nike, said that the greenwashing clampdown in the EU and UK would provide competitive opportunities for companies that had genuine environmental credentials. \u201cFor good brands with good intentions and responsible messaging, I expect there will be little change. But for companies that have oversimplified and overstated their sustainability claims, then life is about to get complicated,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting time to work in the legal department of an advertising agency. We need to pay a lot of attention to the opportunities and risks generated by AI, government policies regarding media platforms like TikTok around the world, and of course greenwashing laws.\u201cIf all brands can claim they\u2019re green, then you remove the incentive to win consumers based on superior commitments to the environment. This will hopefully make being an environmentally responsible brand even better for business,\u201d he said.Within the advertising industry there is ongoing friction regarding agencies continuing to work with fossil fuel companies. Clean Creatives, an organisation based in the US, publishes an annual \u201cF-list\u201d of agencies that work with some of the world\u2019s biggest polluters. It also runs the Clean Creatives pledge, for agencies that want to swear off working with fossil fuel clients in the future. To date, more than 500 agencies have signed up.However, Ad Net Zero has previously declared it does not stand behind that campaign, with its chair, Seb Munden, saying: \u201cWe cannot leave huge swathes of the industry behind.\u201dFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

        "text": "UK households could face higher energy bills next year, after a leading forecaster said electricity market prices will rise in 2024 \u2013 and remain well above pre-energy crisis levels for the rest of the decade.Analysts at Cornwall Insight predicted that Britain\u2019s wholesale power prices would rise from an average of \u00a396.64 per megawatt-hour so far this year to \u00a3129/MWh next year, due to higher gas prices triggered by the war in Ukraine.The analysis was undertaken based on the commodity futures markets at the end of September. Since then, gas and electricity markets have climbed further due to fears that the Israel-Hamas war could pose a risk to oil and gas supplies.Electricity prices were also forecast to stay elevated until the end of the decade, remaining at least 60% higher than they were in 2021 before the global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic caused markets to climb.The analysts expect that as more renewable energy connects to the grid, reducing reliance on gas-fired power plants, market prices will begin to fall. However, they will stay above \u00a380/MWh \u2013 well above pre-crisis levels.Tom Edwards, a senior modeller at Cornwall Insight, said slowing the UK\u2019s shift towards renewable energy could keep energy bills higher for longer. Cornwall\u2019s latest report found the UK was likely to miss its target to increase offshore wind fivefold to 50GW by 2030 due to rising costs in the supply chain.\u201cRolling back our net zero ambitions and slowing our transition away from fossil fuels is likely to be a costly delay that will not only see us fall further behind in decarbonising the country but will leave consumers shouldering the prolonged burden of high prices,\u201d Edwards said.\u201cWithout a resolute commitment to a greener and more sustainable future, achieving net zero emissions and pre-crisis energy bills becomes an increasingly elusive goal,\u201d he added.Cornwall forecasts that by 2030 offshore wind will make up 26% of the UK\u2019s installed electricity capacity, up from about 13% today. Meanwhile, the share of gas power plants will fall from 27% of the UK\u2019s total power capacity to 13% by 2030.\u201cWe can see the country is travelling in the right direction towards a renewables-based electricity system. However, our estimates continue to show it is simply not fast enough to deliver on government targets,\u201d Edwards said.The cost of gas and electricity on the wholesale energy markets makes up just over 50% of the typical household bill. The rest of the bill includes charges to pay for grid upgrades, which are needed to connect new renewables, and the cost of government policies such as supporting low-carbon energy projects.\u201cTime is of the essence, and it is critical that the government reassess its commitment to accelerating renewable energy adoption, which includes being more flexible when setting auction parameters to reach the UK\u2019s offshore wind goals,\u201d Edwards said.",

Twenty-two schools and universities across the continent have been occupied as part of a proposed month-long campaign.In Germany, universities were occupied in Wolfenb\u00fcttel, Magdeburg, M\u00fcnster, Bielefeld, Regensburg, Bremen and Berlin. In Spain, students in occupation at the Autonomous University of Barcelona organised teach-outs on the climate crisis. In Belgium, 40 students occupied the University of Ghent. In the Czech Republic, about 100 students camped outside the ministry of trade and industry. In the UK occupations were under way at the universities of Leeds, Exeter and Falmouth.The most radical actions were taking place in Lisbon, Portugal, where youngsters occupied seven schools and two universities. On Thursday, occupying pupils forced one high school to remain closed for a third day, while students at the University of Lisbon\u2019s faculty of humanities barricaded themselves in the dean\u2019s office.Young people also stopped traffic in the Portuguese capital with street blockades in solidarity with the occupations. The radical action comes despite harsh responses from teachers at one school who called police to evict pupils who began occupations last week.The blockades and occupations are part of an extended campaign under the banner \u201cEnd Fossil: Occupy!\u201d, which aims to build on and escalate the youth climate strike movement that was previously at its strongest during 2019\u2019s mass climate mobilisations.A statement by the campaign read: \u201cEnd Fossil: Occupy! is radicalising the youth climate movement in tactics and demands. Occupations instead of strikes. End the fossil economy instead of \u2018listen to the science\u2019. End Fossil: Occupy! is reigniting the fire of the youth climate movement last seen in 2019.\u201dIt is the second time the campaign has called for a wave of occupations, with 50 schools and universities occupied between September and December last year, including three that were violently evicted by riot police. Organisers claim that previous wave of protest spurred Barcelona\u2019s university to make a module on the climate and ecological emergency mandatory for all students.Organisers hope the latest wave will recapture and recreate the radicalism of May 1968, when anti-imperialist protests by university students in Paris were joined by striking workers and precipitated a wave of revolt across the continent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The total biomass for bigeye, skipjack and yellowfish tuna in the CCZ is predicted to increase by 10-11%, 30-31% and by 23% respectively by the mid-21st century. This could result in increasing conflict between the two industries if more tuna catches are carried out in mining areas, researchers said.Prof Douglas McCauley, a co-author of the study from the University of California, Santa Barbara and the director of the Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory, said: \u201cThese fishing grounds may be distant, but the food they produce is consumed by millions. We would be horrified at dumping mining waste across our food-producing regions on land. We shouldn\u2019t be rushing into a decision that could significantly harm ocean ecosystems essential to planetary health and global food security.\u201dUK \u2018would back global pause on mining deep sea under a Labour government\u2019Read moreTuna populations in the CCZ could be affected by deep-sea mining in different ways, researchers said, although the effect of each has yet to be calculated. The generation of sediment plumes that can travel long distances could prevent feeding or visual communication; potentially toxic metals could be absorbed by species; and noise and light pollution could disrupt behaviour, cause stress and force changes in migratory routes.Daniel Suddaby, the executive director at Global Tuna Alliance, said he was concerned the world was entering \u201cuncharted territory\u201d of risks from deep-sea mining. \u201cFrom threats of prey food shortages due to disrupted midwater ecosystems to the potential upheaval of migration patterns caused by mining disturbances, we must navigate this uncertain landscape with caution. With climate change scenarios further complicating the picture, we cannot underestimate the stakes involved.\u201dThe letter calls for a pause on deep-sea mining until there is a \u201cclear understanding\u201d of the potential impacts, and urged the ISA to agree \u201cstrong, scientifically grounded regulations\u201d before granting any exploration contracts.",

        "text": "Good whisky needs pure clean water, which partly explains why distilleries in Scotland always seem to have such scenic, loch-side backdrops. And one of the best ways to filter that water is oysters. Indeed, the European native oyster was so plentiful in Scotland that 30 million a year were harvested from oyster beds outside Edinburgh in the 1800s.But today the species is almost extinct: populations have dropped by 85% over the past century, most likely because of overfishing from bottom trawling.A new rewilding project part-funded by the Glenmorangie distillery plans to use native oysters a water filters, which would prevent the quality of the company\u2019s whisky from deteriorating, but also mitigate the effects of the organic waste released into the waters of Dornoch Firth. In addition, researchers say the process could increase biodiversity in the area by 50% by the end of the decade.Prof Bill Sanderson, of Heriot-Watt University, diving in Loch Ryan. Photograph: Richard ShucksmithThe scheme would reintroduce 4 million oysters to the Dornoch Firth, on the north-east coast of Scotland, by 2030. As well as helping other species, it could treble the amount of carbon going into the seabed, say scientists working on the project in a new peer-reviewed paper.The Dornoch Environmental Enhancement Project (Deep) is a partnership between Edinburgh\u2019s Heriot-Watt University, the Glenmorangie distillery and the Marine Conservation Society. To predict its potential impact, Heriot-Watt researchers studied Scotland\u2019s last remaining oyster fishery, in Loch Ryan, near Stranraer.The fishery, which has operated since 1701, is unusual in that it uses a rotational harvest system. Different areas are fished, left to repopulate for six years, then fished again, allowing recovery.The work allowed researchers to see how biodiversity increased over time if oysters were left undisturbed, and has been published in the peer reviewed journal, Plos One.Naomi Kennon, the lead author and PhD researcher in restorative ecology at Heriot-Watt, says: \u201cThe findings from our research in Loch Ryan are extremely exciting, demonstrating that biodiversity will probably double over a decade once oyster restoration projects are complete. This means the population of species will increase in a balanced way.\u201cOur data has also shown a link between increased shell material as the oyster population grows and increased biodiversity.\u201dProf Bill Sanderson of Heriot-Watt says the findings were significant because while restorative oyster projects have increased in Europe over the past five years, a lack of data on intact reefs has meant that their impact on biodiversity has not been estimated.Wildlife is thriving in Loch Ryan, the site of Scotland\u2019s last remaining oyster fishery. Photograph: Richard Shucksmith\u201cThis is our best estimate of how biodiversity is able to increase,\u201d he says. \u201cThese findings are significant for Deep and for the Dornoch Firth, but more broadly will help to inform the many marine conservation projects around the world.\u201dIn the study, three plots \u2013 harvested one; two; and six years previously \u2013 were surveyed for biodiversity, oyster shell density and coverage. Biodiversity indicators were 60% higher in the plots that had been left for six years after harvesting.Deep could provide a \u201cbusiness model for restoration\u201d, Sanderson says. \u201cOysters provide food for us, they have biodiversity benefits and some work we covered a couple of years back shows that they treble the amount of carbon going on to the seabed, to be locked away.\u201dHow 100,000 baby lobsters could save Whitby\u2019s fishing \u2013 if they don\u2019t eat each other firstRead moreWhile populations of oysters in the area are so low as to be \u201cfunctionally extinct\u201d, he has found oyster shells dating back 8,000 years. The oyster bed in the Firth of Forth, near Edinburgh, was once 20 miles long by six miles wide.\u201cIt\u2019s shocking when you look at the scale of what\u2019s been lost,\u201d he says. \u201cOysters were a cheap source of protein and had all sorts of other benefits.\u201dVisitors to the Glenmorangie distillery in Dornoch won\u2019t be sampling whisky and oysters anytime soon, however. Hamish Torrie, a company spokesperson, says the company became involved primarily to mitigate the impact of organic waste produced by the distillery.\u201cWe put in an anaerobic digestion plant in 2017 which cleans up 95% of the organic waste. The idea of the oysters, which are filter feeders, was to clean up the other 5%,\u201d he says. \u201cThe oysters have a job to do.\u201d",

The sky has been hazy with pollution on most days since thousands of delegates descended on Dubai for Cop28, with daily air quality readings up to five times above the WHO\u2019s air quality recommendations.The UAE, like many other countries including the US, Norway and the UK, is expanding its oil and gas operations despite scientific consensus that fossil fuels must be phased out if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic climate impacts. State-run oil and gas fields have been flaring gas virtually daily despite having committed 20 years ago to a policy of zero routine flaring, the Guardian revealed last month.\u201cFossil fuels pollute the air people breathe in the UAE,\u201d said Richard Pearshouse, HRW\u2019s environment director. \u201cBut the obliteration of civil society by UAE\u2019s government means that no one can publicly express concerns, let alone criticise the government\u2019s failure to prevent this harm.\u201dThe UAE government says the country has poor air quality but mainly ascribes this to dust from sandstorms.HRW reviewed and analysed government air pollution data from 2018 to 2023, satellite-derived data and government reports, as well as interviewing migrants who work outdoors, exiled Emiratis, academics and environmental groups. The average 2022 concentration of PM10 (particles with a diameter of between 2.5 and 10 microns) taken from 50 sites was more than eight times the yearly WHO recommendation.Migrant workers reported breathing air that burned their lungs, breathlessness and itchy skin, but had little information about the risks and no one to ask for help.Over the past decade, UAE authorities have targeted human rights activists including environmentalists, using laws and the courts to silence critics. People in the UAE wanting to report on or speak out about the risks of fossil fuel expansion and its links to air pollution face the risk of unlawful surveillance, arrest, detention and ill-treatment, according to the HRW report.There have been virtually no Emirati climate or environmental activists at Cop28.\u201cAir pollution is a dirty secret in the UAE,\u201d Pearshouse said. \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t allow civil society to scrutinise and speak freely about the connection between air pollution and its fossil fuel industry, people will keep experiencing health conditions that are entirely preventable.\u201d",

        "text": "Emissions from the food system alone will drive the world past 1.5C of global heating, unless high-methane foods are tackled.Climate-heating emissions from food production, dominated by meat, dairy and rice, will by themselves break the key international target of 1.5C if left unchecked, a detailed study has shown.The analysis estimated that if today\u2019s level of food emissions continued, they would result in at least 0.7C of global heating by the end of the century, on top of the 1C rise already seen. This means emissions from food alone, ignoring the huge impact of fossil fuels, would push the world past the 1.5C limit.Methane emissions from 15 meat and dairy companies rival those of the EURead moreThe study showed that 75% of this food-related heating was driven by foods that are high sources of methane, ie those coming from ruminant livestock such as cattle, and rice paddy fields. However, the scientists said the temperature rise could be cut by 55% by cutting meat consumption in rich countries to medically recommended levels, reducing emissions from livestock and their manure, and using renewable energy in the food system.Previous studies have shown the huge impact of food production on the environment, particularly meat and dairy, but the new study provides estimates of the temperature rises their emissions could cause. These could be a significant underestimate, however, as the study assumed animal product consumption would remain level in the future but it was projected to rise by 70% by 2050.\u201cMethane has this really dominant role in driving the warming associated with the food systems,\u201d said Catherine Ivanovich, at Columbia University in the US, who led the research. \u201cSustaining the pattern [of food production] we have today is not consistent with keeping the 1.5C temperature threshold. That places a lot of urgency on reducing the emissions, especially from the high-methane food groups.\u201d\u201cWe have to make the goal of sustaining our global population consistent with a climate-safe future,\u201d she said.The contribution of global food production to the climate crisis is complex because it involves several important greenhouse gases, all of which have different abilities to trap heat and persist in the atmosphere for different amounts of time. Previous studies have converted the impact of methane and other gases into an equivalent amount of CO2 over 100 years, but this underplayed the high potency of methane over shorter timescales.The research, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, treated each greenhouse gas separately for 94 key types of food, enabling their impact on climate over time to be better understood. Feeding this emissions data into a widely used climate model showed that the continuation of today\u2019s food production would lead to a rise of 0.7C by 2100 if global population growth was low, and a 0.9C rise if population growth was high.\u201cAs we had already reached more than 1C warming above pre-industrial levels by 2021, this additional warming [from food production] alone is enough to surpass the 1.5C global warming target,\u201d the scientists concluded. \u201cOur analysis clearly demonstrates that current dietary production and consumption patterns are incompatible with sustaining a growing population while pursuing a secure climate future.\u201dFood-related temperature rise could be curbed, the researchers said. If people adopted the healthy diet recommended by Harvard medical school, which allows a single serving of red meat a week, the rise could be cut by 0.2C. Such a diet would mean a big cut in meat eating in rich nations but could mean an increase in some poorer countries.Cutting methane emissions from cattle using feed additives and better management of manure could avoid another 0.2C, the researchers said, while switching to green energy in the food system would cut 0.15C. Ivanovich said the emissions reductions options included in the study were those possible today but that future technological advances might be able to reduce emissions further.\u201cWe already know that livestock production has a disproportionate contribution to climate change \u2013 even using traditional metrics, in 2021 we showed that 57% of emissions from the food system arise from animal agriculture,\u201d said Prof Pete Smith, at the University of Aberdeen, UK. \u201cThis very neat study uses a simple climate model to show the disproportionate impact of methane emissions from agriculture on temperature increases, and throws light on the importance of reducing methane emissions from the food system.\u201dOnly a third of the world\u2019s countries have included policies to cut emissions from agriculture in the climate plans they have submitted under the UN Paris agreement. The researchers said their work was aimed at increasing the understanding of the impact of global food consumption on future global heating. Ivanovich also said policies to cut emissions had to protect access to food and livelihoods for vulnerable populations.",

Sleep disturbance is estimated to cost the UK economy \u00a334bn a year, and both light and noise pollution are contributing factors.Picture imperfect: light pollution from satellites is becoming an existential threat to astronomyRead more\u201cNot only can they cause annoyance, impacting quality of life, but through the disruption of sleep and circadian rhythms, both noise and light pollution can contribute to heart disease and premature death,\u201d said King.\u201cWhile the increased risk to an individual may be low, the exposure of millions of people results in a significant aggregate health burden.\u201dRecent studies have also suggested that exposure to artificial light at night may impair glucose and cardiovascular regulation and potentially increase the risk of heart disease or diabetes.Light pollution is not currently well measured in the UK, but evidence from satellite data and citizen science projects suggests it has increased significantly since the rollout of LEDs, the report said.The American Medical Association has previously warned of the health and environmental impacts from \u201cwhite\u201d LED streetlights, advising the installation of dimmer or warmer-coloured outdoor lighting instead.The committee called for the establishment of an expert advisory group on noise \u2013 as already exists for air pollution \u2013 to provide independent advice to the government and assess emerging evidence. It also recommended that UKHSA establish a dedicated group to assess what healthy light exposure looks like, and to draw up UK guidelines.King said: \u201cWe are concerned that there are no specific targets for regulating light and noise pollution, and a lack of coordination between departments, and between central and local government, which is preventing the government from tackling these problems.\u201cThe government should focus on quantifying the health effects of noise and light pollution, set targets and a framework for regulation to reduce the overall burden of disease.\u201d",

One of the company\u2019s pipes spilled sewage into the River Ellen, near the Lake District, for nearly 7,000 hours last year.Raw sewage discharged into English rivers 375,000 times by water firmsRead moreThe data also showed that 10 of the country\u2019s 20 pipes that spilled the most sewage in 2022 were owned by United Utilities, which provides water to the north-west and Lake District.The Liberal Democrats\u2019 environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, said: \u201cAs the sewage scandal runs on, top chiefs at water companies are racking up millions of pounds in bonuses. This is a disgrace. Water companies shouldn\u2019t be allowed to get away with pumping thousands of hours of filthy sewage into our rivers and waterways. We need the Conservatives to stop sitting on their hands, tax water companies and end this scandal.\u201dMegan Corton Scott, a political campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cWe are the only country in the world to fully privatise our national water supply. This gave monopoly powers to the water companies with no conspicuous accountability and little commercial incentive to do anything but collect bill payments. People have no choice but to give them their money in exchange for performance that is, frankly, well below bog standard.\u201cThe theory that the innate decency of the companies\u2019 management would ensure an acceptable level of service has been completely disproven. The results are in and allowing water companies to mark their own homework doesn\u2019t work. Either the government accepts that reform is needed and gives regulators the funding, the legal powers and the spine they desperately need, or our water industry will continue to stink.\u201dWater company bosses have made huge sums from salaries and bonuses in recent years, despite the continuing sewage scandal. Last year, it was revealed that the boss of Anglian Water, which had one of the worst pollution records in England, was given more than \u00a31m in pay and bonuses.The shadow environment secretary, Jim McMahon, said: \u201cThe Tory sewage scandal has allowed water bosses [to] profit from failure, whilst our villages, towns, and cities across the country have been treated as open sewers.\u201cIn the absence of a serious government plan, Labour has brought forward our water quality bill to clean up the water industry once and for all. Labour\u2019s proposed legislation would enforce mandatory monitoring and automatic fines at the point of dumping, ambitious targets that end the sewage scandal by 2030 and deliver accountability for negligent water bosses.\u201dFigures also showed the annual bonuses paid to water company executives rose by 20% in 2021 despite most of the companies failing to meet sewage pollution targets. On average executives received \u00a3100,000 in one-off payments on top of their salaries during a period in which polluted water was being pumped for 2.7m hours into England\u2019s rivers and swimming spots.The analysis of water companies\u2019 annual reports found their bonus pool for executives stood at an average of more than \u00a3600,000 per company. In total the 22 water bosses paid themselves \u00a324.8m, including \u00a314.7m in bonuses, benefits and incentives, in 2021-22.The former boss of Thames Water has been handed \u00a32.8m since leaving the company, despite being sacked for leakages and fines while in charge.United Utilities has been contacted for comment.",

The New Man, from 2016, was about impending fatherhood; Husband, from 2022, showed his complicated feelings about Baum\u2019s career outpacing his. The second was a goofy performance in the autofictional-autofactual grey area; Appignanesi\u2019s cheerfully dishevelled figure was at the centre of almost every shot, sometimes leaving us to wonder if and where he had staged or reconstructed certain important moments \u2013 a heightened video-diarising or guided reality.Now, he has taken what appears to be a quantum leap to a new level of seriousness. A professional setback just before lockdown (the sudden disappearance of funding for a projected feature) leaves him with time on his hands and Appignanesi takes an interest in Extinction Rebellion. He brings his camera to marches and meetings and is soon a deeply committed member, culminating in a triumphant speech at an XR protest outside 55 Tufton Street in central London, the notorious headquarters of climate-denying thinktanks, storming it in front of the crowd. Then his agent offers him a lucrative gig making a TV ad for Esso \u2013 and Appignanesi is tempted.Watch the trailer for My Extinction.It isn\u2019t that you doubt Appignanesi\u2019s sincerity, although his deadpan facial expression in some of the more emotional XR meetings is sometimes difficult to read. On one march, he finds himself alongside the comedy writer David Schneider; their banter seems to relax him and the film\u2019s punning title demonstrates his comedy instinct.The question arises whether he has cultivated a kind of Louis Theroux ambiguity in talking to the long-term XR faithful to suppress a mickey-taking impulse, or to create the space for his audience to do the mickey-taking on his behalf. Actually, no; he later tells his wife that people\u2019s testimonies at a certain XR meeting really had brought him close to tears. But there is a disconnect between the importance of what he is talking about and the self-deprecation and throwaway comedy that dominates his style; these worked better with smaller-scale confessionals.Much though I always enjoy Appignanesi\u2019s performances, the contradiction is not entirely solved. His central message is clear enough: if his career in making heavyweight films is finished, well, what of it? (I don\u2019t believe for a moment that it is; Appignanesi is surely going to make a witty metropolitan comedy in this same minimalist style.) The planet is in danger and that is what we should be thinking about and acting on, rather than worrying about our negligible careers. My Extinction is released in UK cinemas on 30 June.",

This will reduce the value of carbon-heavy assets including shares or loans for fossil fuel projects or their related companies, which will in turn harm the institutional investors like bank, insurers and fund managers that hold them.Globally, the report estimates that banks would probably need a total of $4.9tn in international bailouts if fossil fuel assets collapsed in 2030, putting 13.6 million jobs at risk worldwide.One for One campaign, which is backed by groups including Positive Money UK and the Sunrise Project, is calling for coordinated action from governments and financial regulators to address what it says are critical weaknesses in the banking and insurance sectors. That would involve banks and insurers holding one pound worth of capital in reserve to match every pound used to finance or insure fossil fuel projects.\u201cIf we don\u2019t have rules in place to ensure fossil fuel financing is backed by adequate levels of capital, it will be impossible to transition to a low carbon economy without triggering serious financial instability,\u201d Joshua Ryan-Collins, an associate professor in economics and finance at the University College London\u2019s Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose, said.\u201cBanks and insurers need to have buffers in place to absorb shocks arising from collapses in the value of oil, gas and coal assets as new regulation kicks in and demand falls as renewables scale up,\u201d he explained. \u201cEnhancing capital requirements for dirty assets should also encourage banks to shift their lending away from unsustainable activity, which in itself will reduce transition risk.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Instead the government whipped its MPs to reject the draft of the bill containing legal safeguards to stop any environmental laws being downgraded.As the bill returns on Tuesday to the Lords, peers are tabling two more amendments to put an environmental baseline into the bill and prevent protections being downgraded.Ruth Chambers of Greener UK, a coalition of 10 major environmental organisations including the National Trust, RSPB and The Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cThe more that the government refuses to compromise on this amendment, the more suspicious its motives appear. Why would a government that says it is committed to environmental protections continue to resist adding a protective layer in this bill?\u201cIt is an uncontroversial change that would provide reassurance to people worried about air pollution and water quality. We hope ministers will seek sensible compromise.\u201dThe government has rowed back on plans to ditch all remaining EU laws by the end of the year. It now aims to remove 800 statutes and regulations, instead of 3,700 laws it had lined up for a \u201cbonfire\u201d of EU law in December.Last month peers inflicted a major defeat on the government, voting in favour of an amendment calling for greater parliamentary scrutiny of the EU laws to be scrapped at the end of the year and an amendment ensuring that future governments cannot weaken existing levels of environmental protection.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This is more than in most European countries, such as France, Spain and Germany, where the amount is about 120-130 litres per person.However, critics have argued that water companies should be taking measures to retain water supplies, such as fixing leaks and building reservoirs, before focusing on individual use.The regulator has said that rather than charging a flat standard amount based on the type of property, or a flat rate based on how much water it is used, a more dynamic pricing structure is needed.It has recommended water companies adopt trials of seasonal charging to help lower water bills in the winter, reducing bills for homes with water butts and permeable driveways, which can help to reduce the risk of flooding and pollution to rivers and bathing water, and charging more for water at peak times.Ofwat said successful trials of these charging methods could be rolled out to all households in a given area.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The local wildlife policing team opened an investigation led by PC Claire Dinsdale, a recipient of the Queen\u2019s police medal for her work on wildlife crime. But weeks later, the case was abruptly closed, and a search on the estate where the eagle was found dead was cancelled. The RSPB described this decision as \u201cbaffling\u201d.Around the same time, the local wildlife crime team was rebranded \u2013 removing \u201cwildlife\u201d from its name. Dorset police rural wildlife and heritage crime was renamed as Dorset police rural crime team on its Twitter account, and police sources confirmed this rebrand took place to \u201creflect the broader work we are undertaking to ensure we provide exceptional local policing to our rural communities\u201d. The wildlife crime section of the local policing website has also been removed.Dead eagle found in Dorset was poisoned but case closed, police confirm Read moreDinsdale then went on leave, and the Guardian understands that she has been told that on her return she will no longer be a wildlife crime lead.Sources who were part of the white-tailed eagle death investigation told the Guardian that they were concerned about the hostility to wildlife crime investigations in the area, pointing out that the local MP, Chris Loder, said that police funding should be focused on other crimes.Wildlife groups fear that influential landowners who have interests in removing police focus from wildlife crime could take inspiration from the situation in Dorset, and that this pattern could be repeated throughout the country.Dr Ruth Tingay, a co-founder of wildlife campaign group Wild Justice and author of the Raptor Persecution blog, said: \u201cIf police wildlife crime teams are disbanding or rebranding to exclude wildlife crime, this flies in the face of government and police commitments to tackle wildlife crime, and particularly raptor persecution which is supposed to be a national wildlife crime priority but is on the rise according to the latest annual reports.\u201cThere is absolutely no justification whatsoever for ignoring these crimes when there is a statutory duty for raptors to be protected.\u201dThe RSPB, which is still conducting its own investigations into bird poisoning in Dorset, said it was concerned by the changes in Dorset police.RSPB\u2019s head of investigations, Mark Thomas, said: \u201cRSPB Investigations enjoy a good working relationship with police wildlife and rural crime teams across the UK, especially in relation to fighting raptor persecution, the illegal killing of birds of prey, most often relating to land used for gamebird shooting.\u201cDorset police \u2026 has been an exemplary force to work with. We obviously have concerns if the level of response from any force to wildlife crime incidents was diminished in any way, as there is clearly lots of work to be done, especially at a time when raptor persecution is at a modern day high and we have suspicious deaths of amazing birds like white-tailed eagles.\u201dA spokesperson for Dorset police said: \u201cDorset police is committed to keeping everyone in our county safe, including our wildlife, which brings so much to our beautiful countryside and our communities.\u201cAs part of the police uplift programme and working together with the office of the police and crime commissioner we have reviewed our rural crime strategy for the county and allocated increased numbers of officers to the rural crime team to tackle the issues that matter. This includes all aspects of rural, wildlife and heritage-related crime.\u201cWe will continue to work closely with many different partner agencies in relation to these issues. We want to make it clear that we take any and all potential wildlife offences seriously and will act to prevent and detect offences wherever possible.\u201dA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe recognise the importance of tackling wildlife crime and those who hurt animals should be subject to the full force of the law.

        "text": "The Guardian view on Europe\u2019s green transition: moving to the slow lane? | EditorialRead moreA clash over climate protection measures is threatening to unravel Germany\u2019s three-party governing alliance, after the Green party accused its liberal coalition partners of gambling away the country\u2019s reputation by blocking a EU-wide phase-out of internal combustion engines in cars.\u201cYou can\u2019t have a coalition of progress where only one party is in charge of progress and the others try to stop the progress,\u201d the country\u2019s vice-chancellor and economy minister, Robert Habeck, said at a meeting of the Green party\u2019s parliamentary group in Weimar on Tuesday.The pro-business Free Democratic party\u2019s (FDP) last-minute opposition to EU plans to ban sales of new cars with internal combustion engines from 2035, which European leaders are hoping to resolve at a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, had damaged Germany\u2019s standing in the bloc, Habeck said. \u201cWe are losing debates, we are getting too little support for our projects.\u201dThe German liberals\u2019 sudden rethink has caused frustration not just in the ranks of its coalition partners but in other European capitals, where there are fears that the continent\u2019s largest economy reneging on previously struck agreements will embolden other states to act in a similarly erratic fashion.Germany\u2019s e-fuel EU loophole could mean \u2018135bn more litres of petrol burnt\u2019Read moreFDP politicians argue that the phase-out in its current form risks destroying a German manufacturing industry that could in the future offer viable climate-neutral fuels as an alternative to purely battery-powered electric vehicles.\u201cWe in Germany master the technology of the combustion engine better than anyone else in the world,\u201d the FDP transport minister, Volker Wissing, said on German television on Wednesday night. \u201cAnd it makes sense to keep this technology in our hands while some of the questions around climate-neutral mobility remain unanswered.\u201dIn a proposed compromise, the European Commission has reportedly suggested criteria for a new category of CO2-neutral fuel-powered vehicles that could remain on European roads after 2035. Wissing\u2019s transport ministry has not yet officially replied to the proposal.To the surprise of its own members, the German Green party had remained relatively reserved in the debate over the combustion engine \u2013 until this week, when Habeck\u2019s intervention raised the temperature in Berlin\u2019s seats of power.In a television interview on Tuesday night, the minister for economic affairs and climate action also accused the FDP and his senior coalition partner, the Social Democratic party (SPD) of chancellor Olaf Scholz, of deliberately leaking an early draft of a law banning new fossil fuel heaters in Germany from 2025.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the war in Ukraine bringing a collapse in gas deliveries, that target was supposed to be moved forward, to the start of 2024.Since Habeck\u2019s ministry tried to turn that policy into law, however, there has been a ferocious backlash over its cost to ordinary households, led by the mass tabloid Bild.Habeck said the draft law had been leaked \u201cin order to damage the trust within the government\u201d, which had made him question the other parties\u2019 will to reach a compromise at their scheduled meeting this Sunday.The FDP and the Greens are both struggling in the polls, with the ecological party currently close to the worse-than-anticipated 15% it achieved at federal elections in September 2021. The liberals, meanwhile, are hovering just above the 5% threshold for entering parliament and have lost votes in a string of regional and state elections.",

        "text": "Richer countries and private lenders are trapping heavily indebted countries into reliance on fossil fuels, according to a new report.The pressure to repay debts is forcing poor nations to continue investing in fossil fuel projects to make their repayments on what are usually loans from richer nations and financial institutions, according to new analysis from the anti-debt campaigners Debt Justice and partners in affected countries.The group is calling for creditors to cancel all debts for countries facing crisis \u2013 and especially those linked to fossil fuel projects.\u201cHigh debt levels are a major barrier to phasing out fossil fuels for many global south countries,\u201d said Tess Woolfenden, a senior policy officer at Debt Justice. \u201cMany countries are trapped exploiting fossil fuels to generate revenue to repay debt while, at the same time, fossil fuel projects often do not generate the revenues expected and can leave countries further indebted than when they started. This toxic trap must end.\u201dAccording to the report, the debt owed by global south countries has increased by 150% since 2011 and 54 countries are in a debt crisis, having to spend five times more on repayments than on addressing the climate crisis.Daniel Ribeiro, a programme coordinator for the Mozambican environmental campaign Justi\u00e7a Ambiental, said the country\u2019s debt burden had been doubled by loans taken without parliament\u2019s permission from London-based banks in 2013, based on projections of earnings from its gas field discoveries.Mozambique was plunged into a debt crisis when oil and gas prices fell in 2014-16, Ribeiro said, but the solutions from international lenders to bail out the country have relied on loans being repaid through future gas revenues.\u201cThe debt caused by fossil fuels are being structured to be paid back by fossil fuels, solidifying a vicious cycle of having to move forward and having very severe consequences of not wanting to continue with fossil fuels,\u201d Ribeiro said.Mozambique debt crisis could be first sign of global financial shockwaveRead moreSuriname faced a similar situation after defaulting on its debt, when in 2020 it agreed a deal that would give creditors the right to almost 30% of Suriname\u2019s oil revenue until 2050.Sharda Ganga, the director of the Surinamese civil society group Projekta, said they had hoped the deal would have remained within the country\u2019s climate commitments.Ganga said: \u201cAs our debt has grown unsustainable, it dominates all policy decisions and impacts the lives of our citizens in every possible way. Earning money as quickly as possible in order to pay back the creditors is therefore priority number one. It means there is no more room for patience and such pesky things like sustainability or climate justice.\u201cThe reality is that this is the new form of colonialism \u2013 we have exchanged one ruler for the rule of our creditors who basically already own what is ours. The difference is this time we signed the deal ourselves.\u201dLeandro G\u00f3mez, a campaigner on investment and rights at the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation (Farn) in Argentina, said the country has been stripped of sovereignty to transition away from fossil fuels, and was having to subsidise fossil fuel companies, encourage fracking projects and cancel renewable energy projects.The report also said many climate-affected countries needed more access to grants to pay for the effects of changing climate, as many are forced further into debt to pay for repairs after cyclones and floods.Climate activists hold up a banner demanding the cancellation of developing nations\u2019 debts during the Cop27 climate conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt last November. Photograph: Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty ImagesMost of the $10bn (\u00a37bn) in financial assistance provided to Pakistan after last year\u2019s floods was in the form of loans, while the share of Dominica\u2019s debt of its gross domestic product (GDP) rose from 68% to 78% after Hurricane Maria in 2017.Mae Buenaventura, from the Asian People\u2019s Movement on Debt and Development, said: \u201cThe climate and debt crises emerged from the same system that is based on the global north\u2019s relentless extraction of human, economic and environmental resources to feed the drive for profit and greed.\u201dShe said debt cancellation was the least that rich countries and lenders could do.",

        "text": "The European Commission is likely to propose a three-year delay on post-Brexit tariffs on electric cars, after months of lobbying by industry and the UK government.Carmakers were fearful that exports between the UK and EU \u2013 in both directions \u2013 would be hit by 10% tariffs in the new year because of \u201crules of origin\u201d aiming to reduce China\u2019s dominance of the global battery industry.A delay to the tariffs, if confirmed, would remove one dark cloud hanging over European carmakers. An official announcement is possible as soon Wednesday, pending approval by the European Commission\u2019s cabinet.The tariffs were planned as early as 2020. So why are they still an issue three years later?Delay EU tariffs to help sales of electric cars, says UK car industryRead moreWhy are tariffs an issue?It stems from Brexit. The UK and the EU agreed the Trade and Cooperation Agreement on Christmas Eve in 2020, setting out the post-Brexit trading relationship. Both sides used the deal to try to spur the creation of a European electric car battery industry.The deal gave carmakers until 1 January 2024 to source batteries from within the UK or EU, or else face 10% tariffs on exports of electric cars either way across the Channel.Batteries are the most expensive component of electric cars, and battery manufacturing is dominated by South Korea, Japan and \u2013 most of all \u2013 China. The deadline was meant to push carmakers into building batteries in the UK or Europe. Yet approaching the January deadline, carmakers are still dependent on Asian batteries and materials, meaning most UK-EU car exports would become more expensive. Perversely, petrol and diesel cars would be unaffected.What went wrong?The coronavirus pandemic and rising interest rates have got in the way. A huge wave of battery factories in Europe, including two in the UK, is on its way, but will not be ready in time.The carmakers have been arguing in public that they have no way of meeting the deadline.What is at stake if the deadline is not delayed?Tariffs would be unavoidable if the deadline is not extended. Two-thirds of the UK car industry\u2019s output goes to the EU, while the UK has long been one of the most lucrative markets for Germany\u2019s premium carmakers, in particular.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They include Toyota, Ford and Jaguar Land Rover, all of which have factories in Britain, plus BMW and Volkswagen, which own Rolls-Royce and Bentley in the UK.Manufacturer Stellantis, which employs more than 5,000 people in the UK, including 1,000 at its Vauxhall electric van factory in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, and 1,200 at its Luton plant, has said the tariffs would make production in the UK not viable.Why has an extension taken so long?It is not only the carmakers with UK factories who are worried. Europe\u2019s powerful lobby group, the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association, is firmly in favour of extension, as is the UK government.Yet the EU has been wary of anything that could be seen as reopening the Brexit deal, particularly if it would benefit the UK. Thierry Breton, an influential European commissioner, said in September he did not want to reopen the trade deal just to help the car industry.Germany and other countries with a significant car manufacturing base pushed for a suspension, but France argued this would involve reopening the Brexit agreement and require support from 27 member states. It seems the French may have relented.A delay to the tariffs would represent a belated turnaround from the EU \u2013 but it will be warmly welcomed by the car industry on both sides of the Channel.",

        "text": "My wife, Jackie, and I used to be a lot more rock\u2019n\u2019roll than we are now. Before we moved to the country, we lived in Greenwich, south-east London, and we used to get a bit ginned-up and very excited about things. I remember it being quite close to my birthday in March; we were watching some David Attenborough thing on TV. They had a decorator crab on, which creates a camouflage by encrusting itself with whatever it finds around it, making it near invisible. I fell in love with the whole concept and remember waxing lyrical about dropping beads, sequins and diamonds into a tank so that a decorator crab could use them.Obviously, I was extraordinarily, grandiloquently overenthusiastic and my wife was so desperate to grant my wish that she did indeed buy me a decorator crab for my birthday, at considerable inconvenience and, I would imagine, expense. Of course, the problem with a decorator crab is that you can\u2019t just buy it a little bed and a lead; you need a whole ecosystem. Basically, we ended up with a coral reef in our kitchen.We called him Caligula \u2013 although I don\u2019t think it really suited him. You always think of Caligula as being incredibly spoilt and petulant, but there was something stoical about my crab. We then had a spending frenzy that resulted in us acquiring as many colour-coordinated fish as we could get. Of course, picking fish based purely on the Pantone colour chart meant we had quite a few disasters. \u201cOh my God, I found a fish in the perfect shade of magenta!\u201d It would turn out to be incredibly poisonous to all the other fish, or get eaten immediately by something bigger.\u2018I imagined the world would see it as my greatest work\u2019 \u2026 Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen at home. Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThen there is the maintenance of a fish tank, which is unbelievably complicated. My wife hit upon the idea of getting a contract with a guy to come and do it. This meant that costs became stratospheric, because the decorator crab basically had his own nanny. He would notice a dead fish and offer to replace it and we would say: \u201cOh yes, find something pretty.\u201d We would then end up with fish that were endangered, expensive, near mythical! The money just kept going up and up.But Caligula was a fine decorator crab, quite jolly. I used to get a bit of a pincer wave sometimes if I walked past the tank. The children and I would drop beads and sequins in there. We lived close to Greenwich market, where we would find little bits of china. I had this vision that, after a while, Caligula would create this accretion on his shell of little china hands of Victorian dolls and cherub faces, and that I would end up with such an unbelievably beautiful decorator crab that the world would see it as my greatest work. Sadly, Caligula was fine on the sequins, all right on the beads, but he did not like the bits of china.Costs became stratospheric, because he basically had his own nannyIt didn\u2019t end well. The minute the summer holidays dawned, I would drive to our house in Cornwall. We had a wonderful guy housesitting in London and I remember having a message from him saying that he wasn\u2019t sure what was going on with the heating, but it was all a bit hot. I wrote it off, because it was summer, but it turned out that the ridiculously over-specced farmhouse range we had in our kitchen had a fault and wasn\u2019t turning itself off.When I got back, the house was indeed very hot. The tank was looking murky and I realised it was because most of the fish in there were bouillabaisse-d. But Caligula was on the bottom of the tank with his pincer up. I thought: \u201cAt least Caligula has survived.\u201d A couple of days later, he was in exactly the same place. His exoskeleton had been fused to the spot, leaving him almost entirely hollow inside, the tank cleaning guy said. It was very sad. I never got over the fact that he had died in a heroic pose. He looked like a crab equivalent of the Colossus of Rhodes.I was so brought down by the whole thing that we gave the tank to the children\u2019s primary school. They actually looked after it and made sure that it wasn\u2019t so close to a farmhouse range.Several months later, I was watching a programme about bowerbirds and, in a flight of enthusiasm about the fact that satin bowerbirds build nests only with blue things, I thought: \u201cOh, we could have a bowerbird!\u201d \u2013 before I remembered. Be careful what you wish for.",

We are the ones that implement the law.\u201dState officials also drew a distinction between the law being challenged \u2013 a provision of the Montana Environmental Protection Act that they characterized as \u201cprocedural\u201d \u2013 and regulatory acts such as the Clean Air Act of Montana.Only regulatory acts can be used as the basis for permit rejections, and those don\u2019t allow permits to be denied in Montana based on climate impacts, said the DEQ air, energy and mining division administrator, Sonja Nowakowski.The young plaintiffs testified over five days last week that the climate crisis is marring their lives, with smoke from worsening wildfires choking the air they breathe. Meanwhile drought is drying up rivers that sustain agriculture, fish, wildlife and recreation.Olivia Vesovich, 20, a student at the University of Montana who grew up in Missoula, said she suffers from breathing problems that make wildfire smoke nearly unbearable.As her respiratory reactions grew worse during the frequent smoke events that have shrouded Missoula, Vesovich said her mother in recent years started taking them on long trips during fires to find cleaner air.\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s suffocating me, like if I\u2019m outside for [just] minutes,\u201d Vesovich said. \u201cClimate change is wreaking so much havoc on our world right now and I know that will only be getting worse.\u201dIn prior rulings, state district judge Kathy Seeley significantly narrowed the scope of the case. Even if the plaintiffs prevail, Seeley has said she would not order officials to formulate a new approach to climate action.Instead, the judge could issue what\u2019s called a \u201cdeclaratory judgment\u201d, saying officials violated the state constitution. That would set a new legal precedent of courts weighing in on cases typically left to other government branches.",

        "text": "The New South Wales Coalition and Labor each presented plans for clean energy investment over the weekend. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the differences between the two promises.What has the Coalition announced?On Saturday, the incumbents promised a $1.5bn clean energy superpower fund, which includes $1.2bn already announced to upgrade transmission networks in the transmission acceleration fund.NSW Labor pledges $1bn state-owned investment company for renewable projects if electedRead moreThe additional $300m is marked to pay for grants to storage and grid security projects, including pumped hydro and batteries. A further $23m was promised to expand the electricity infrastructure roadmap to include rooftop solar and smaller batteries.What is Labor offering?On Sunday, Labor pledged to create a $1bn state-owned energy security corporation to drive investment in renewable energy projects.Under this plan, the government would partner with companies working on medium- to long-term renewable storage solutions and technologies that provide grid stability and community batteries, funding it with cash from the existing Restart NSW fund.The NSW Labor leader, Chris Minns, said the plan would enable the government to fund projects that \u201censure reliability in the system and keeps the lights on and creates new jobs\u201d.If Labor forms government after 25 March, it would maintain the Coalition\u2019s $1.2bn transmission acceleration fund.How do these promises differ?Both of these plans are focused on dealing with gaps in the market where private investment is more challenging, but they are attacking the problems in slightly different ways and with different amounts of funding.Labor has put more money on the table while seeking to partner with private companies developing renewable energy projects rather than offering grants from a fund like the Coalition is planning.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe policy director of the Nature Conservation Council, Brad Smith, said the main difference between the two is the scale of investment. \u201cLabor\u2019s is larger,\u201d he said.\u201cBoth of them are looking at using public funds to invest but also leverage private funding. There\u2019s more similarities than either party wants to admit.\u201dThe acting chief executive of the Smart Energy Council, Wayne Smith, said both parties were offering \u201cpretty comprehensive plans\u201d.\u201cThe NSW government\u2019s been particularly focusing on specific renewable energy zones and getting investment in those areas,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat Labor\u2019s announcement does is to specifically focus on renewable energy storage and that\u2019s still the missing piece of the puzzle. That\u2019s an area where probably the NSW government hasn\u2019t had as strong a position so far.\u201dWhy are these investments needed?According to the experts, some renewable projects can be risky and incredibly costly, which makes them less attractive investment projects.Wayne Smith describes renewable energy storage as \u201cnot quite bankable yet\u201d, which makes it harder to attract funds.\u201cWe just need that extra bit of support and innovative financing to get those projects over the line,\u201d he said.Brad Smith said larger projects had also struggled.\u201cThat\u2019s why these funds are a really large intervention to make sure these projects that are so important for energy security get built and get built on time,\u201d he said.\u201cThe market needs a lot of certainty in order to access capital. Having the public funds available is one of the most important things to de-risk a project.\u201dWhich will be more effective?That depends who you ask. Most experts say it depends on how these programs are implemented and they all said more work was still needed.The executive director of the Australia Institute, Richard Denniss, said Labor\u2019s plan would get things happening more quickly.\u201cIf you want to drive big change in a hurry, it\u2019s better to do it through the public sector. What\u2019s different here is who\u2019s driving the bus.\u201cThere is a government saying to the market: \u2018There\u2019s money here, who would like to build things?\u2019 Whereas there\u2019s Labor saying: \u2018These are the things we want to build, who\u2019d like to help us build them?\u2019\u201dWayne Smith said Labor\u2019s focus on storage and its model \u2013 based on the federal Clean Energy Finance Corporation \u2013 was beneficial.\u201cThat\u2019s a great model and we\u2019re really pleased that they\u2019ve adopted that point,\u201d he said.\u201cThe focus on renewable energy storage \u2026 that puts them ahead of the game.\u201dWhy are both parties investing in this sector?The promises were welcomed by a sector that has been calling out for government intervention to plug the gaps where private markets are failing.Denniss said it is good to see governments throwing money into decarbonising the economy.Brad Smith described the efforts as \u201cheartening\u201d.\u201cBoth major parties [are] recognising that the public wants action on climate change,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "New reservoirs are needed across England to cope with increasingly severe water shortages that are putting the UK at risk of not being able to grow the food consumers require, a farming leader has warned.Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union of England and Wales, said failure to manage the country\u2019s water adequately was creating problems for farmers and threatening food supplies.This winter has not alleviated last year\u2019s drought to the extent farmers had hoped. Earlier this week, the National Drought Group said England was \u201cone dry spell away\u201d from a repeat of last summer\u2019s dry conditions.Batters said farmers were watching anxiously. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got East Anglia, Devon and Cornwall that are in drought,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 63% of rivers below the level that they should be.\u201d\u201cIf we\u2019re going to abstract less, we\u2019ve got to store more,\u201d she said, which would mean constructing more reservoirs. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have the ability to store more, that needs to be thought about very urgently. This is a massive issue.\u201dAcute shortages of salad and vegetables in the UK have led to empty shelves, and driven some supermarkets to ration the sale of items such as peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes. Those problems have been mainly caused by unseasonably cold weather and frosts in key exporting regions of Spain and north Africa.The empty shelves have focused attention on the UK\u2019s food security. About 40% of the country\u2019s food is imported, and farmers at the NFU conference in Birmingham earlier this week said this left the UK vulnerable to outside supply shocks.For Batters, food security and the question of water are closely intertwined. There can be none of the former unless the government takes action to secure supplies of the latter, she said.\u201cWater is a massive issue. I\u2019ve had the line trotted out to me so many times: \u2018Oh Minette, we are a wealthy nation, we can import our food.\u2019 I just think that ship has sailed, and we take food for granted \u2026 And water security is a massive part of that.\u201dNo new reservoirs have been built in the UK since the water industry was privatised in 1989, and some water companies have added to their profits by selling off existing reservoirs. Water companies have paid out \u00a372bn in dividends since privatisation, borrowing \u00a356bn and increasing bills by 40%.But the problems are not just down to water companies and the weather. Farmers have also played a part in water shortages, according to Craig Bennett, the chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts. \u201cOur agricultural system has been appalling at encouraging farmers to use water properly,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been an unthinking approach, as if water was a limitless resource.\u201dBennett pointed to the amount of land used for growing animal feed that, with a change in diets, could be more efficiently used to grow crops for humans. Farmers also use poor practices, relying on over-abstraction of groundwater to make up for it, he added.\u201cWe need to think about different ways to grow crops \u2013 you still see farmers planting and drilling downhill, which lets the water run off,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cSome farmers still don\u2019t want to see the reintroduction of beavers, which do a fantastic job of creating mini-reservoirs \u2013 or ponds, as they are otherwise known.\u201dMany crops \u2013 from sugar beet to maize \u2013 are thirsty and potentially unnecessary in the UK, as the products could be grown more efficiently elsewhere.Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said the management of water must go far beyond reservoirs, and that farmers must play a role. \u201cRewetting peatlands, rewiggling rivers, regenerating farmland soil structure \u2013 these all have a crucial role to play in slowing and storing water in our environment, so that more is available for people and wildlife,\u201d he said.Farmers and consumers could also use water more efficiently. \u201cDemand management is critical too, with stricter standards for buildings, consistent metering, and incentives for businesses to cut back use,\u201d Benwell added.The regulator Ofwat is considering the UK\u2019s response to increasingly frequent droughts, and the role of water companies. Benwell said: \u201cThere is a real risk that Ofwat will push water companies down an old-fashioned built infrastructure route yet again, without capitalising on the savings and benefits of nature-based solutions. Government should clearly instruct the regulator to prioritise solutions that work with nature.\u201dA spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cWe recognise the importance of long-term water planning for the farming sector to improve resilience and business planning. We will be launching the second round of the water management grant this spring to support farmers to improve on-farm water management, such as water reservoirs and new irrigation systems.\u201cOfwat has also allocated a \u00a3469m fund for water companies to investigate strategic water resources options, including regional water transfers.\u201d",

It is disingenuous to think that there are easy alternative funding solutions available. Would it be preferable not to have a book festival? Those who shut down conversations through boycotts and absolutism cause needless divisions that prohibit action.Book festivals that offer space for thought and debate, and inspire change across the generations are part of the solution. If the writers were serious about collective action instead of virtue signalling off the back of Greta Thunberg\u2019s cancellation, they should be offering solutions not ultimatums, and campaigning on behalf of book festivals not against them.Name and address supplied As Charlotte Higgins points out in her article on the messy reality of greenwashing (Of course Greta Thunberg is right to call out greenwashing, but the reality can be messy, 11 August), absolutist actions have often been the fountainhead of change, particularly in social movements. However, those opposed to fossil fuels, more often than not forget how inextricably these fuels are tied to everyone\u2019s daily lives, including theirs.Nearly everything we own comes from industry and almost every industry \u2013 including the book business \u2013 uses fossil fuels to some extent in the manufacture and distribution of its products. So a true boycott of financiers of fossil fuels is almost impossible, as is the boycott of industries that have an environmental impact. And frankly, if we do want to adopt a holier-than-thou stance, why end with fossil fuels? As Higgins mentions, why not gambling companies and other such businesses?For initiatives in the arts, the search for the \u201cuntarnished penny\u201d is like searching for the holy grail, particularly in an economy where sponsor money is so hard to find. Clearly, compromises are inevitable, and the Edinburgh book festival seems to have chosen judiciously. Unless, of course, the protesters can step in with more concrete plans of eco-friendly sponsorship.While I understand the concerns of the protesters, I think that instead of mounting \u201cban fossil fuels\u201d campaigns, they might do better if they spoke of realistic ways in which they themselves are boycotting these fuels in their daily lives and helping others do the same. I might actually get more from that.Finally, I think it\u2019s rather hypocritical that people seem to have no such qualms about the Baillie Gifford nonfiction prize, but want to target a festival that\u2019s actually providing a platform to have meaningful discussions on such matters.Megha GuptaBath Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

But it won\u2019t \u201cbe implemented on time or on budget\u201d, with delays inflating costs even as the climate crisis adds to challenges, the commission\u2019s interim review of the plan\u2019s implementation has found.The review was also critical of previous Coalition governments.

It also proposed a new government-owned corporate entity to operate at arm\u2019s length from governments as one option to ensure effective implementation of the plan.The failure of governments to meet water recovery targets meant delivery costs \u201cwill be considerably higher than first estimated\u201d, with rising water and construction costs over the past 15 years, the commission said.Climate climate would add \u201can ongoing challenge\u201d to water management with the basin expected to get hotter and drier, with more frequent and severe droughts and floods, and greater variability.\u201cThere should be more clarity about how the climate change objectives are measured and assessed,\u201d the report said.Basin governments should also publicly report on how water resource plans deliver on First Nations objectives and outcomes, and strengthen the capacity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to engage in plan activities, the review said.",

The volume lost during the hot summers of 2022 and 2023 is the same as that lost between 1960 and 1990.The analysis by the Swiss Academy of Sciences found 4% of Switzerland\u2019s total glacier volume vanished this year, the second-biggest annual decline on record.

Glacier Monitoring in Switzerland (Glamos), which monitors 176 glaciers, recently halted measurements at the St Annafirn glacier in the central Swiss canton of Uri since it had mostly melted.Matthias Huss, the head of Glamos, said: \u201cWe just had some dead ice left. It\u2019s a combination of climate change that makes such extreme events more likely, and the very bad combination of meteorological extremes. If we continue at this rate \u2026 we will see every year such bad years.\u201dHe said small glaciers were disappearing because of the rate of ice loss. In order to stop Switzerland losing its ice, emissions needed to be halted, he said, but added that even if the world managed to keep warming to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, only a third of glacier volume in Switzerland was forecast to remain.This meant, he said, that \u201call the small glaciers will be gone anyway, and the big glaciers will be much smaller\u201d.

They were the longest sentences yet passed on non-violent protesters in the UK.Noting Decker and Trowland\u2019s rights to peaceful protest, Fry asked the UK government to explain \u201cwhy, in light of the current climate crisis, it was necessary to introduce and pass the Public Order Act and how both the Public Order Act and the sentencing of Mr Decker and Mr Trowland are compatible with international norms and standards\u201d, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.He demanded ministers indicate \u201cwhat steps have been taken \u2026 to ensure that non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations and all human rights defenders can carry out their peaceful work free from threat, violence, harassment or retaliation or any sort\u201d.The UK government has not replied to Fry\u2019s letter, which was sent on 15 August.

Labour will speed up planning to build the homes we need without trashing the environment.\u201dRayner said: \u201cThe Tories are being thoroughly disingenuous in suggesting that the only way we can build the homes we need in sensitive river catchment areas is by weakening environmental law. Don\u2019t fall for it.\u201cLabour will table our own amendment when this is put to a vote in the Lords [on Wednesday]. Our amendment would force the government to launch, complete and publish a consultation within three months to consider alternative ways to reform nutrient neutrality regulations.\u201dMichael Gove, the housing secretary, and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the environment secretary, recently announced they would be ending what they termed \u201cdefective\u201d EU laws, which require developers to offset any extra nutrient pollution they cause in sensitive areas, under the habitats directive. These areas include the Lake District and Norfolk Broads.Ministers are aiming to remove the legal requirement via an amendment in the House of Lords, which requires local authorities to ignore potential pollution risks when approving developments. It will be debated on Wednesday. Gove and Coffey\u2019s amendment proposes that instead of forcing housebuilders to invest in local wetland sites to soak up any extra sewage pollution and mitigate damage, this legal requirement would be scrapped and taxpayer money would instead be used to double the funds for a scheme by Natural England to reduce nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates in waterways. These nutrients choke the life out of rivers and cause damaging algal blooms.It was unclear as to whether Labour would back the amendment. Lisa Nandy, the previous shadow levelling up secretary, seemed to be in favour of it, saying: \u201cLabour will support effective measures that get Britain building, but it\u2019s laughable to think that a prime minister who is too weak to stand up to the nimbys on his own backbenches can be trusted to deliver the housing Britain needs.\u201cWith housebuilding projected to fall to the lowest level since the second world war and our rivers full of sewage, the Tories are failing on both housing and the environment.\u201dHowever, after lobbying from environmental groups, it appears Labour has changed its mind about unwinding the EU-derived laws, which were part of the habitats directive that is in place to protect the rarest wildlife in Europe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But, despite their importance, there has been no long-term monitoring of soil invertebrates.To fill the gap, researchers collated data from more than 100 different smaller studies ranging from 1928 to 2018. From this they estimated a decline in earthworm abundance of between 33% and 41% in the last quarter of a century, the period for which the best data was available.The research is being presented at the British Ecological Society\u2019s annual meeting in Edinburgh on Monday and is being peer-reviewed for publication.\u201cIt\u2019s looking like there is evidence of a long-term decline,\u201d said Prof James Pearce-Higgins, the director of science at the British Trust for Ornithology, which conducted the research. \u201cA large-scale decline in soil biodiversity \u2013 particularly the loss of earthworms \u2013 would sit alongside concerns about \u2018insectaggedon\u2019 and the wider biodiversity crisis.\u201cIt would have widespread impacts on the species that feed on soil invertebrates, like birds, but also affect soil processing and nutrient cycling, the whole functioning of our ecosystems,\u201d he said. \u201cThrushes, starlings and many waders that rely on soil invertebrates are in long-term decline. These declines are greatest in south-east England where hotter, drier summers may also reduce the availability of earthworms to foraging birds.\u201dDr Ailidh Barnes, also at the BTO, said there were good reasons to expect declines in earthworms on farmland. \u201cChanges in the UK countryside over the last century, such as extensive drainage, pesticide use and inorganic fertiliser application, are likely to have negatively affected earthworm populations.\u201d Repeated ploughing was also likely to cause harm.The scientists scoured thousands of studies to find those containing suitable data. They then took account of differences in the methods used to provide the best window into the past available in the absence of a formal monitoring programme. They found earthworm declines appeared greatest on farmland and in broadleaved woodlands. Wilder upland areas, further from human activity, were less affected.The team concluded: \u201cThe [study] suggests that a previously undetected biodiversity decline has occurred in the UK that could have wide-ranging consequences for ecosystem structure and function.\u201dPearce-Higgins said the team hoped the study would prompt further investigations and the establishment of proper monitoring. \u201cWe need to be concerned about what is happening to biodiversity below the ground in order to protect the biodiversity that we see above ground.

        "text": "Across the country this weekend campaigners will paddle out on their local rivers or beaches to warn water companies they will not put up with another summer of sewage pollution.No doubt they will be buoyed up by the high-profile mea culpa trumpeted by privatised water companies on Thursday, along with a promise to treble their existing investment in pipes, water treatment works and water storage to \u00a310bn over the next 10 years.But if Ruth Kelly, the head of the industry body Water UK and one of the architects of this belated change in direction, thinks it will see off any more of these mass protests, she is likely to be disappointed.Kelly, who is new to the job, reverted to dubious claims about the Victorians as she promised the new investment. \u201cThese are 150-year-old pipes, and sewage systems that need to be upgraded,\u201d she said. The Victorian myth has been used for years by water companies as an excuse not to act because the task was just too great.In fact pipes, sewage and treatment plants mostly date back to the 1970s and 80s. In the more than three decades since water was privatised, there have been many opportunities to invest the necessary money to keep modernising, but as some water bosses now admit, they have instead overseen decades of underinvestment, while taking huge salaries \u2013 in one case \u00a33.9m \u2013 and paying dividends to shareholders which last year reached \u00a31.4bn.Within the puff of the announcement carefully placed in friendly media on Thursday by an industry forced into a change of tack, the crux is stark. It is the customer who will be paying for this trebled investment, which water companies should have been carrying out for years to fulfil their legal duties. And it has always been the customer who pays, as the once publicly owned utility has morphed over the decades into a highly complex, opaque financial instrument set up to maximise returns for investors.Now the customer will be asked to pay even more if the companies are true to their word and triple their investment. This is despite Ofwat having made clear last year that water companies had all the funding needed to carry out all their legal responsibilities, which are to treat sewage and provide clean water, and did not need to raise bills.Kelly said on Thursday that by and large the water companies had indeed been carrying out their legal duties; a spin which may be one too far for many of those waxing surfboards and blowing up paddleboards before the mass protest on Saturday.So far have some water companies been from carrying out their legal duties that six of them are at the centre of a major investigation into suspected illegal activity by Ofwat.And it was only two years ago that Southern Water was fined a record \u00a390m for illegally dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into protected waters amid a reprimand from the judge for its repeated criminality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "The number of listed threatened species in Australia\u2019s world heritage northern rainforests has increased by 25% since 2020, as ecologists say they are now clearly observing the long-predicted impacts of global heating.The management and conservation authority for the Unesco-listed Queensland wet tropics this week handed its latest environmental report to the state government, containing \u201csombre but pragmatic\u201d warnings about the declining health of some species, including the ringtail possum, that were believed robust when the area was given international protection in 1988.\u201cThe insidious and damaging threat posed by invasive species and diseases, and the impacts of climate change, present real danger to the continuing integrity of the area\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d the report says.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nIt found a number of additional species \u2013 including endemic rainforest frogs, ringtail possums, high-altitude birds and myrtle plants \u2013 that were considered secure at the time of world heritage listing, \u201cnow face significant challenges from accumulated and compounding threats\u201d.Stephen Williams, a rainforest ecologist and a director of the Wet Tropics Management Authority, says his analysis showed there had been a 25% increase to the number of listed threatened vertebrate species in the area in the past three years.Williams said previously predicted declines in some species were now being observed first-hand.Tropical forests face \u2018massive leaf death\u2019 from  global heating, study findsRead more\u201cIt\u2019s primarily climate \u2026 it\u2019s almost entirely climate,\u201d Williams said.\u201cThe wet tropics as a world heritage area is in relatively good shape \u2026 but there is a rapidly increasing number of species that are either on the threatened list, or soon be on the threatened list.\u201cThis sort of thing is happening rapidly and it takes years to get something listed as threatened. Governments tend to only want to fund or even talk about things that are officially listed.\u201cBut whatever statistic we use, the problem is actually twice as bad as that. More species are declining than are currently listed.\u201dWilliams said the situation had left the wet tropics \u201cat a real risk of losing the very things it was made a world heritage area to protect\u201d.Many species in the wet tropics have been affected by severe heatwave or droughts. More than 23,000 spectacled flying foxes were killed \u2013 about 30% of the entire population \u2013 during a two-day heatwave in November 2018.Tropical Queensland\u2019s spotted-tail quoll facing extinctionRead moreWilliams said it was now clear that creeping average temperature increases \u2013 as opposed to short-term weather extremes \u2013 were also contributing to biodiversity stress in cool-adapted upland species like the ringtail possum, and some frog and bird species.\u201cSome of these are showing signatures of slow decline in increasing heat,\u201d Williams said.\u201cFor those particular species \u2026 it\u2019s hard to imagine what you can do beyond climate action.\u201dAnother increasing threat to rainforest biodiversity has come from bushfires. Previously the damp rainforest had been considered a natural fire barrier, but in recent years bushfires have caused serious damage.\u201cThe wet tropics region can expect more frequent and more intense fires due to hotter temperatures,\u201d the report said.\u201cThe capacity of the area\u2019s endemic rainforest species to regenerate after fire is poorly studied.\u201dIn a statement, the management authority said \u201cthere remains a narrow window where we can bring threatened species back from the brink through bold new programs and partnerships\u201dEastern Kuku Yalanji woman Christine Grant, the chair of the authority, said there was no \u201csilver bullet\u201d.\u201cThe best available science tells us the way to protect threatened species is through long-term planning, rethinking our investments, and prioritising landscape-scale restoration to tackle climate change with better fire management and projects that reduce other threats such as invasive species,\u201d Grant said.\u201cWorld heritage listing for the wet tropics has provided a measure of protection to save species, but invasive pests, diseases and more frequent and extensive storms and other natural disasters, particularly fires, threaten this internationally significant region.\u201d",

        "text": "Council leaders in Salisbury have hit back at \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d attacks on their decision to replace single-use hanging basket displays and planters provided by the council with environmentally friendly sustainable planting in the medieval city centre.As part of an effort to become carbon neutral by 2030 and encourage bees and butterflies into the city centre, the coalition-led council this week voted to pilot replacing hanging baskets with \u201cliving pillars\u201d and \u201cparklets\u201d, which it hopes will provide pockets of nature in the heart of the city.The leader of the Conservative opposition, Eleanor Wills, called it \u201cideological nonsense as per from [a] leftwing cabal\u201d and said it was \u201c\u2018incredibly unfortunate for a city with medieval roots\u201d.She said: \u201cFor a leftwing city council to outright ban hanging baskets and other floral displays for reasons of sustainability and biodiversity suggests [\u2026] a new and undesirable avenue for ideological silliness.\u201dBut the independent councillor Annie Riddle, one of the leadership group, said the move had been blown out of proportion as part of a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d by Wills and that there was no ban in place on hanging baskets, after some local business owners expressed concern that their own flowers would be outlawed.\u201cYou can\u2019t really scrap hanging baskets, that\u2019s a ridiculous exaggeration. Plenty of the shops and pubs have hanging baskets, and they can continue to do that \u2013 nobody\u2019s banning them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is trialling a different form of environmentally friendly council planting. To be honest with you, this is a politically motivated row that has been manufactured.\u201dRiddle said the council had already stated that if the new displays were hated, there was \u201cnothing to stop\u201d the council reinstating baskets next year.\u201cSalisbury\u2019s history is one of its principal glories, but it can\u2019t live in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are other ways that things can look nice, be more friendly to wildlife and provide more shade. We hope that that style of planting will attract more wildlife and be more bee-friendly.\u201dIn a review in 2019, the council committed to making the city as carbon neutral as possible by 2030 to help tackle the climate change emergency.New plans detailed in a five-page report include the construction of a \u201cparklet\u201d in Market Square, with a wheelchair-accessible seated area surrounded by plants, which the council says would provide natural shade and require less intensive watering.Proposals also include replacing traditional hanging baskets with \u201cliving pillars\u201d, vertical plant installations that the council argues would \u201coffer more benefits to wildlife and require less watering\u201d.June was UK\u2019s hottest on record, says Met OfficeRead moreMarc Read, the council\u2019s environmental services manager, said that while colourful displays were \u201can expression of civic pride\u201d, they were \u201cincreasingly demanding in terms of costs and other resources as the summer becomes increasingly dryer and hotter, as the climate continues to change\u201d. The budget for the 2023-24 floral displays, including watering, is \u00a330,000.The row has also centred on a plant structure known as \u201cGilbert\u201d \u2013 a floral display in the shape of a dragon that has been a longstanding feature of Salisbury centre, and which the council says requires 30,000 litres of water a year. The council report states that \u201cGilbert\u2019s frame has reached the end of its lifespan, with much of the internal watering pipework now failing\u201d.Riddle said a local group, Men\u2019s Shed, had offered to try to repair the structure, while the council was exploring ways to replant or recreate Gilbert but with more environmentally friendly plants.\u201cWhat\u2019s been lost sight of in all this is the reality of climate change and the fact that we\u2019re going to have to adapt,\u201d she said. \u201cAll that the city council is trying to do is what the electorate indicated when we were voted in two years ago, which is to make our city more environmentally friendly and keep it as green and pleasant as it is now for future generations.\u201dThe Met Office said this week that last month was the UK\u2019s hottest June on record.",

        "text": "Contain your excitement at news that bosses of a few water companies won\u2019t be taking their bonuses this year. In all three cases \u2013 South West Water, Thames Water and Yorkshire Water \u2013 acceptance of any bonus at all would rightly have provoked general outrage. These firms were at, or near to, the bottom of the league table in the Environment Agency\u2019s last set of annual environmental performance ratings.At the most sludgy end, South West joined Southern in scoring the lowest possible one star out of four, which the chair of the EA \u2013 a body that itself has hardly excelled during three decades of under-regulation \u2013 translated into plain English: it meant the companies\u2019 environmental performance \u201cwas terrible across the board\u201d. Thames and Yorkshire were two of four companies getting two stars, which indicated a need for \u201csignificant improvement\u201d, so still deeply in cruddy territory.It is conceivable, of course, that the trio have upped their game and undergone a transformation since the EA published its ratings for 2021 last July. But, even if they have (don\u2019t hold your breath until this July), the timing doesn\u2019t work bonus-wise for the 2022-23 financial year. Improvement has to be seen to have happened \u2013 and then to be achieved regularly to remove weather-related vagaries.Given the star ratings, many may wonder if Sarah Bentley at Thames, Susan Davy at Pennon (owner of South West) and Nicola Shaw at Yorkshire are volunteering to forego bonuses they wouldn\u2019t have received anyway. The answer \u2013 strange as it sounds \u2013 is that, actually, they are probably surrendering a few hundred thousand pounds or so each.Sarah Bentley, chief executive of Thames Water, has waived her bonus. Photograph: Thames WaterIn common with the set-up across the entire UK quoted-company scene, the formula for awarding bonuses tends to include so many metrics that it is hard for a chief executive to be awarded zilch. Aside from financial targets, the service-related metrics themselves contain a dashboard of dials. There\u2019s always something to achieve.Bentley\u2019s incentives, for example, include reducing complaints from customers \u2013 an area where the numbers at Thames have markedly improved recently. And Davy\u2019s bonus last year included ticks for hitting leakage targets, reducing emissions and maintaining a \u201cgreat place to work\u201d accreditation. That was despite South West\u2019s \u201cwastewater pollution incidents, per 10,000km sewer\u201d running at more than three times the target level and the water quality being deemed miles away from the required standard.The mini bonus surrender, then, can be seen as an acknowledgment that handing out prizes for financial performance or minor operational triumphs is unacceptable if you\u2019re still failing on core environmental measures. Quite right too: the customers don\u2019t care if South West is a nice place to work; they are overwhelmingly bothered about water quality and sewage dumping.Bentley and Davy were first out of the blocks in recognising the bleedin\u2019 obvious. Counterparts at the sector\u2019s other laggards now know what\u2019s expected \u2013 and shouldn\u2019t hang about. But the other conclusion here is that relying on executives\u2019 sense of embarrassment when public anger is red-hot is a terrible way to structure a performance-related remuneration scheme.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hundreds of thousands of homes collapsed, streets were inundated and millions of people were made homeless.My home in Naseerabad, a town in the Qambar Shahdadkot district of Sindh province, was flooded and unlivable. With my children and husband, I moved to my mother\u2019s house. We were four families living in one room \u2013 my sister, brother and their children too. More than 20 people were living under one roof, which we worried would collapse on top of us. But I was lucky to have a place to stay.

Photograph: Fareed Khan/API immediately became involved in relief work. The first move of the Women Democratic Front was giving financial assistance to widows, older women and those with health issues who now had no financial support at all. We helped 85 women initially.Soon we learned of other needs after visiting camps set up along the district\u2019s highways. Women, particularly pregnant women, and children were worst affected. Many arrived at the camps with only the clothes they were wearing when the rains came.We gave them something to wear. We gave out sanitary towels. We gave children toys to help relieve the boredom and take their minds off what was happening.There were no female toilets at the camps. Women told us they would go to the washrooms in groups at night. They lived in fear of being sexually abused or harassed by others at the camps.One student told me: \u2018We are afraid of the men if we sleep outside. It is better to die than be sexually abused\u2019Female students at a college in Naseerabad chose to sleep inside the building rather than outside. I asked one of them: \u201cWhat if the roof falls down?\u201d She replied: \u201cWe are constantly afraid that the men might make advances on us if we sleep outside. It is better to die than to be sexually abused.\u201dIt was pregnant women who seemed most in need. They had little access to medical care. The regular check-ups they should have had stopped with the flood waters. I told one that she should take medicine to help with her pregnancy. She replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t have food. How can we have medicine?\u201dSeeing the need, we quickly arranged for a huge medical camp to be set up, with six doctors and specialist women healthcare workers to see patients and distribute medicine. More than 300 people attended in the days after it opened.During the early days of the relief effort, I couldn\u2019t sleep at night after going to the field. I found it traumatic. I felt helpless not being able to support all the women who needed it.I have been disappointed with the government, which I think has been ineffective in reaching out to people. The Sindh government had the resources but they did not work well.I would share the women\u2019s stories with my husband. I often cried at night. But at least I felt I was doing something.Women gather to receive aid in the aftermath of the 2022 floods. Photograph: Courtesy of Abida ChannaAnd there was some light in this grim situation. In one village I visited, some women had got hold of a television and managed to connect it to the power.

The water is still here and it can get cold. Many families \u2013 including mine \u2013 have now returned to their dilapidated homes, living in tents within the shells of their buildings.

        "text": "The triangular loop of arrows that has been the universal symbol of recycling for the past five decades could itself end up being binned in the US, with Joe Biden\u2019s administration mulling whether it is misleading to the public.The \u201cchasing arrows\u201d logo, designed by a college student for the first Earth Day in 1970, has become ubiquitous on everything from cartons of milk to shampoo bottles as a way to nudge users to recycle packaging rather than discard it.\u2018Six times the size of Yosemite\u2019: the new tribal sanctuary off the super-rich LA coastRead moreBut the widespread use of the symbol on products that are not routinely accepted for recycling is helping stoke \u201cconsumer confusion about what is recyclable and/or compostable\u201d and is leading to \u201cdeceptive or misleading\u201d claims on packaging, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).The EPA said it is regularly bombarded by public queries about what is able to be recycled, and called for the recycling logo to be ditched from whole classes of plastics, in official comments lodged with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC is currently updating its rulebook on the sorts of environmental claims that companies can accurately make about their products.At issue is the use of the logo along with the \u201cresin number\u201d of different types of plastics. Resin one and two plastics, such as bottles and jugs, are the most easily recycled products, but those marked with numbers three to seven, categories that include plastic bags, styrofoam and plastic trays, are typically not recycled and are instead sent to landfills or burned.The placement of the chasing arrows symbol upon these hard-to-recycle single-use plastics \u201cdoes not accurately represent recyclability as many plastics (especially 3-7) do not have end markets, and are not financially viable to recycle,\u201d the EPA said in its comments.A new rule was needed, the agency said, to help clear up this confusion. In 2021, California passed a law to restrict the use of the logo to avoid misleading claims about recycling.Environmental groups are pushing for an end to the blanket use of the logo, too, claiming that its use amounts to \u201cgreenwashing\u201d by companies.\u201cInstead of getting serious about moving away from single-use plastic, corporations are hiding behind the pretense that their throwaway packaging is recyclable,\u201d said John Hocevar, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace, which has previously released research finding that most types of plastics are not recycled in the US.\u201cWe know now that this is untrue,\u201d he said. \u201cThe jig is up.\u201dOnly around 5% of plastics are recycled in the US, a proportion that has been declining since China announced it would no longer be accepting unwanted plastic waste from western countries in 2018.American households produce around 51m tons of plastic waste a year, more than any other country, with much of that either dumped in landfills, incinerated or littered, often ending up in the ocean.Recycling isn\u2019t itself a panacea to this situation, the United Nations warned in a report this week. Excessive packaging and single-use plastics need to be eliminated from use, the report found, which would be among a series of steps that could slash global plastic pollution by 80% by 2040.",

        "text": "Bristol is the latest city to propose a clean air or low emissions zone. These improve air quality by excluding the most polluting vehicles. Good news for the health of 100,000 people who live in the centre of Bristol \u2013 but not everyone is happy.One common objection is that zones only accelerate changes that would happen anyway as old vehicles wear out and are replaced. However, poor air is estimated to cause a health burden of more than 200 early deaths each year in Bristol, 9,600 in London and 32,000 UK-wide.Q&AHow does air pollution affect the human body?ShowAir pollution has been described as the \u2018new tobacco\u2019 by the head of the World Health Organization. Over 90% of the world\u2019s population suffers toxic air and research is increasingly revealing the profound impacts on the health of people, especially children.Children and babies\u2019 developing bodies are most at risk from toxic air, with 300 million living in places where toxic fumes are six times above the international guidelines.\u00a0A comprehensive global review found that air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body. It causes issues from heart and lung disease to diabetes and dementia, and from liver problems and bladder cancer to brittle bones and damaged skin. The systemic damage is the result of pollutants causing inflammation that then floods through the body, and from ultrafine particles being carried around the body by the bloodstream. A Canadian study recently linked air pollution nanoparticles to brain cancer for first timeIn the UK, while deaths attributed to air pollution have halved in the last four decades, most urban areas have illegal levels of air pollution. One in 20 deaths in the UK is still attributable to small particle pollution alone.Damian Carrington, Environment editorWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A study in London suggests that children in the most polluted areas are growing smaller lungs, a change that is not fully recoverable. Balanced against these impacts, we cannot justify delay.Early analysis of London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone showed a decrease of 29% in nitrogen dioxide from traffic alongside major roads. Changes in outer London, well away from the zone, were used to estimate what would have happened without the scheme \u2013 just 7% decrease.Others worry that polluting vehicles will divert, moving the problem. However, studies from Germany and London show the opposite. The cleaner vehicles required in these zones also drive in the surrounding area, spreading the benefit.",

        "text": "With our forlorn sense that politics isn\u2019t working and that democracy is broken, as we feel the impacts of both climate change and the decision to leave the European Union in real time, the symbolic answer to our political crisis was always staring us in the face. It was Caroline Lucas, the best prime minister we never had \u2013 and, now that she is standing down from her Brighton Pavilion seat, we will never get.In her bold but gentle way, Lucas embodied the fact that politicians and politics could be better. Not perfect, but good enough. Good enough to know that meaningful change needs a vision of a good society to compel it, alongside bold enough policies and strong enough alliances to get us there.As the lone Green MP, Lucas embodied those traits and more. Necessity is the mother of invention. She had no choice but to forge alliances with other MPs, to work cooperatively on bills and campaigns on everything from stopping fracking to reversing the ludicrous privatisation of our water companies.Tony Benn famously said that politics wasn\u2019t about personalities but issues. He was both right and wrong. Politics is about ideas, movement and moments. But it is always about people \u2013 about political leaders. We need charismatic, inspiring and purposeful leadership. Not demagogues, but full-time professionals who know their job is to help us build a good society and lead good lives.The energy and ambition Lucas brought to this pursuit was incredible. Great works are performed, as Samuel Johnson told us, not by strength but by perseverance. Lucas persevered. But she is human. And political humans, as we saw with Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s former prime minister, tire and burn out. The system is so broken that no single person can hope to fix it.Lucas has signalled that she will continue to work tirelessly on climate change, again echoing Benn, who said on leaving Westminster that he was stepping down to spend more time with his politics.But Westminster, Whitehall and formal politics do matter. They are the sites that set the rules that determine how we regulate society, the economy and our democracy, and how we invest public money. While power has clearly slipped through the fingers of the formal political classes over the past few decades, away from the green benches to blue-chip corporations, big tech companies and, thankfully, to civil society campaigns, the role of formal politics in facing perma-crisis, while insufficient, is still necessary.We need a political class that can spend and regulate in the right way, that knows its job isn\u2019t to usher in a better world for us, but to create the conditions in which we can build it ourselves. Lucas knew that, but our political and democratic system is so broken it fails to people like her; it wears them down and spits them out. It hoards power at the centre, while opening itself up to the rich and powerful as it turns its back on the rest of us. It lets small factions win control of parties and ruthlessly exploit their position with impunity. It produces identikit MPs who meekly follow the whip in a system that puts party before country.So, it is bewildering that just when we need more politicians like Lucas, we lose those few we have. But big change was never going to come from within the system. It\u2019s too cosy and too keen to protect its interests over ours. So her leaving isn\u2019t a sign that all is lost, but that change can and must come to a broken edifice. It\u2019s as if the ravens are leaving the Tower of London. Some, such as Lucas and the compelling Labour MP Jon Cruddas, are jumping, others, such as Jamie Driscoll, the serving Labour mayor for North of Tyne, and Beth Winter, a south Wales Labour MP, are being pushed out. But it\u2019s a sign that change is coming.Everywhere beyond the desiccated walls of parliament, people are picking up the torch: the overwhelming majority of Labour members and unions who know we need proportional representation to create a fairer electoral system that brings in other voices; the thousands of activists and millions of voters who campaigned and voted tactically in the May local elections; the political experiments such as the primary being trialled in south Devon; the huge number of people on the streets for Extinction Rebellion, the companies queueing up for B Corp status to build an economy more in tune with our planet and its people.Everywhere, except Westminster, change is in the air. The brittle walls of the old politics will tumble. A better politics of collaboration and putting issues before parties looks like Lucas. We know what to do. She has shown us.\nNeal Lawson is director of the cross-party campaign organisation Compass\n",

This means Garie beach is extremely difficult to access for the general public,\u201d they wrote.From 2012 through to last summer, the shark net at Garie Beach has caught 20 target sharks and 109 non-target marine animals, and no target shark was caught last season, they wrote.A department official wrote back on Thursday and said: \u201cAs the minister announced last Monday, there will be no changes to the shark meshing program that starts tomorrow, with all 51 nets scheduled to go back in the water.\u201d\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nEmma Hurst, an Animal Justice party MP, said the \u201clazy\u201d decision showed the Minns government was proceeding with the \u201cstatus quo\u201d without considering whether shark nets were actually needed.\u201cYou can\u2019t protect beachgoers from a shark attack from a beach that is closed to the public \u2013 this is ludicrous,\u201d Hurst said.Dr Chris Pepin-Neff, a public policy lecturer at the University of Sydney, said Garie beach was a \u201cgreat metaphor\u201d for the effectiveness of shark nets and that the Minns government\u2019s \u201czero risk\u201d approach to shark mitigation was \u201cfolly\u201d.\u201cI appreciate their point that they want to phase out shark nets when the technology is right, but beach safety in NSW needs to be based in reality,\u201d he said.\u201cThe reality is there is no decision that the government will make that will determine if a shark will bite you in the ocean or not.\u201dThe installation of the shark nets for this summer comes a week after 44-year-old surfer Toby Begg was attacked by a great white shark at Lighthouse Beach in Port Macquarie on the state\u2019s mid-north coast.Proponents of shark nets point out that there has only been one fatality from a shark at a netted beach since the meshing program began in 1937. They want the nets to remain in place to protect swimmers, at least until modern deterrents such as drones and Smart drumlines are more advanced.Environmental groups strongly oppose the nets because other animals, including threatened species, can become trapped in them and die.Several coastal councils and a chorus of NSW MPs, including Liberals, Greens and crossbenchers, have all recently voiced their opposition to the nets, arguing they do not protect swimmers and take too great a toll on marine life. Data published last month by the state government showed almost 90% of animals caught in the nets over the past year were non-target species such as turtles, rays and dolphins.The department and the state\u2019s agriculture minister, Tara Moriarty, have been contacted for comment.On Friday the premier, Chris Minns, said calls from opponents to use technology such as drumlines were laudable but the measures were not advanced enough to replace nets.\u201cIf you look at the alternatives that are available on Sydney beaches, they\u2019re not going to be as effective as existing shark nets in place,\u201d he said.",

With the electric tuk-tuks, basically you don\u2019t have any noise and you don\u2019t have any emission from tailpipes.\u201dIn 2021, the levels of the pollutant PM2.5m in Thailand were four times higher than World Health Organization guidance. Inhalation of PM2.5 can cause respiratory problems and heart issues. In 2019, pollution was to blame for more than 31,000 deaths in the country.\u2018We are ready\u2019: relief and excitement builds in Thailand with Chinese tourists set to returnRead more\u201cIn big cities like Bangkok [or] Chiang Mai, the key source would be the incomplete combustion in diesel engine vehicles,\u201d says Kannika Thampanishvong, senior research fellow on climate change policy and green growth at the Thailand Development Research Institute. As of 2019, there were almost 20,000 tuk-tuks in Thailand, typically powered by internal combustion engines.The demand for electric tuk-tuks is growing, Kritayakirana says. In 2022, their number increased from 263 to 498, according to the Electric Vehicle Association of Thailand. The government has been encouraging EV uptake since 2015.Fariha Essaji, a UK mother who used to live in Bangkok, used the electric tuk-tuks offered by UMT\u2019s ride-hailing app Muvmi because they were cheaper than taxis and bigger than usual tuk-tuks so could accommodate a pushchair. But she says she appreciated the electric element given it made the vehicle less noisy.Muvmi plans to increase its fleet of electric tuk-tuks from 350 to more than 1,000 in Bangkok, climbing to 5,000 nationally within five years. Vichian Suksoir, deputy executive director of the innovation department at Thailand\u2019s National Innovation Agency (NIA), says many hotels are now purchasing electric tuk-tuks to transport guests.But electric tuk-tuks alone won\u2019t make much difference to air quality, says Dr Surat Bualert, an assistant professor focused on environmental science at Kasetsart University. \u201cI think [electric] cars can improve air quality because the research and chemical analysis shows the major source of PM2.5 is transportation. Tuk-tuks cannot because the ratio of tuk-tuks is small compared to other vehicles.\u201d\u2018Very good for tourists\u2019: Thailand aims for high season with U-turn on cannabisRead moreAbout 10m cars are registered in Thailand and the government aims to make 30% of its auto production zero-emission by 2030. Suksoir says NIA has earmarked 100m baht ($3m or \u00a32.5m) for the development of EVs and related technology in 2023.But EVs aren\u2019t \u201cthe holy grail of making travel more sustainable\u201d, says Ewan Cluckie, founder of Tripseed. They rely on grid power to charge, and in Thailand only 14.9% derives from renewable sources.\u201cUntil we can transition the charging capabilities entirely to renewable energy, there is still some reliance on fossil fuels,\u201d he says. And until issues of cost and range can be addressed, a wider transition to electric tuk-tuks \u201cwill be held back\u201d.Electric tuk-tuks can only travel short distances before needing to be charged, while the price to buy one is about 400,000 baht ($12,000), Cluckie says. The starting price for a traditional tuk-tuk is about 150,000 baht ($4,500).\u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to get much money secondhand for their two-stroke tuk-tuks, and certainly not enough to go out and buy a brand new electric tuk-tuk\u201d, Cluckie says. \u201cOn a grander scale across the city, I think it\u2019s going to take a lot of time\u201d.But Kritayakirana says electric tuk-tuks will be cheaper in the long-run because petrol is much costlier than a battery. He believes EVs, including electric tuk-tuks, \u201care the future\u201d.",

        "text": "Tropical forests could become so hot that some kinds of leaves will no longer be able to conduct photosynthesis, according to a study published in the journal Nature.The photosynthetic machinery in tropical trees begins to fail at about 46.7C on average. The research suggests that forests may be nearing dangerous temperature thresholds sooner than expected.Using a combination of high-resolution data from Nasa\u2019s thermal imaging instruments on the International Space Station and ground-based experiments in tropical forests across the world, researchers found that a small fraction, approximately 0.01% of all leaves, are already exposed to temperatures beyond their functional limits.Models predict that once we hit a global temperature increase of 3.9 C, these forests might experience mass leaf damage.Warming leaves, even if now in low numbers, act as a \u201ccanary in a coalmine for tropical ecosystems\u201d, said Chris Doughty, an associate professor of ecoinformatics at Northern Arizona University and the lead researcher of the study.He said the leaf-warming experiments had revealed a nonlinear rise in temperatures. \u201cWe were really surprised that when we warmed leaves by 2, 3 or 4C, the highest leaf temperatures actually increased by 8C. This shows a concerning nonlinear feedback that we were not expecting,\u201d said Doughty.\u201cIf we adopt a do-nothing response to climate change and tropical forest air temperatures increase by greater than 4C, there could be massive leaf death, possible tree mortality and species turnover across all tropical forests,\u201d he added.In terms of global impact, \u201cthe photosynthetic response would be the tip of the iceberg in terms of effects \u2013 reduced carbon uptake, likely increased mortality and even triggering possible transitions from forest to savannah\u201d, said Mat Disney, a professor of remote sensing at University College London.At least 50% of global CO2 exchange occurs through forest canopies, which act as key regulators of our climate.\u201cThe importance of this work is that it is a first look at the specific impact of this leaf-scale warming on photosynthesis in tropical forests,\u201d Disney said. \u201cSo while it is quite specific in one sense, it also provides a really interesting look at one of the underpinning processes in this region, and what might happen to it in the near future if we don\u2019t act fast.\u201dAvoiding high emissions in the first place was key to stabilising temperatures. \u201cWe should do all we can to avoid high-emissions scenarios. Under low-emissions scenarios, almost all tropical forest tree leaves can avoid death from overheating and the trees will survive,\u201d said Simon Lewis, a professor of global change science at University College London.\u201cYet what the study doesn\u2019t look at is heatwaves. We still might see tree deaths from overheating for limited periods during heatwaves under lower-emissions scenarios. Given that trees are very long-lived, an isolated mass tree death event could have major impacts for the rest of the plants and animals that rely on these big trees in the rainforest canopy,\u201d Lewis added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Yet the oil and gas industry isn\u2019t listening. Last year it committed half a trillion dollars for new capital expenditure on future drilling and extraction, while making outrageous profits of $4tn. Business as usual will destroy life as we know it.Energy is fundamental for development and meeting basic needs. But producing it from coal, oil and gas is simultaneously the cause of the climate emergency. Clearly the issues of climate, energy and development must be addressed in an interconnected way. This is very difficult against a post-Covid backdrop when poor nations have record levels of debt. In the wake of the Ukraine invasion, rising interest rates have caused the dollar to surge \u2013 raising the cost of meeting loan repayments which are often denominated in the US currency. African nations spend up to five times their health budgets on debt obligations.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, should be congratulated for hosting a summit to reimagine financial solutions to the interlinked global goals of tackling poverty, curbing planet-destroying emissions and protecting nature. But there is still a long way to go. The announcement by the International Monetary Fund that rich countries had met a target, set in 2019, of a $100bn climate fund for poor countries is probably less than meets the eye. The contrast with the trillions of dollars mobilised in an instant, to bail out finance houses in 2008, is stark. It is inexcusable that funds to address global heating cannot be found.\u201cFor us it is about saving lives, for others, it is about saving profits,\u201d said Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, chiding the rich world for inaction during a \u201cpolycrisis moment\u201d. Colombia\u2019s president, Gustavo Petro, called for a global financial transaction tax. Kenya\u2019s president, William Ruto, came to Paris after endorsing a report, \u201cJust Transition\u201d, which pointed to Africa\u2019s potential for harnessing renewable energy far outstripping any projected needs. Yet the continent has been barely able to industralise at all, let alone tap its vast green power potential.Leaders in North America and Europe are intent on reshaping their energy systems, but the key materials required are found in the developing world. Even China, which dominates critical rare earth elements and their processing, lacks vital metals. This should allow for a grand bargain, where poorer countries are given policy space to address the three structural deficiencies that hinder their development \u2013 a lack of food sovereignty, a lack of energy sovereignty, and low value-added manufacturing \u2013 in return for sharing their minerals. Otherwise, parts of Latin America, Africa and Asia risk becoming targets of a new scramble for resources \u2013 with clean energy firms behaving as destructively as fossil fuel companies: buying off politicians, wrecking ecosystems and lobbying against environmental regulations. The cash, debt relief and access to western markets needed by developing nations should not feed the engines of extractive capitalism.Mr Ruto said the three weeks taken to create the current \u201cBretton Woods\u201d financial institutions should be enough to design their replacement. This might sound ambitious but it was Martin Luther King who warned against the \u201ctranquillising drug of gradualism\u201d. This sense of urgency is needed now to stop an environmental disaster.",

It\u2019ll recover if that\u2019s the only year that it happens, but not if it keeps happening.\u201cThe question in my mind is: is the man-made chlorine going to get \u2026 diluted and destroyed out of the atmosphere faster than global climate change is going to increase the frequency and intensity of this kind of fire? I think it\u2019s going to be a race.\u201dDr Martin Jucker, a lecturer at the University of New South Wales who was not involved in the research, agreed that the ozone hole might recover more slowly than expected as the result of more bushfires in future.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the absence of any major changes, we expect that stratospheric chlorine concentrations will gradually decrease this century and that the ozone hole will get smaller year by year.\u201cOf concern is that while the ozone hole usually forms over Antarctica because of the cold temperatures there, wildfire aerosols appear to be capable of promoting ozone losses at the relatively warmer temperatures present at mid-latitudes which are heavily populated.\u201dSolomon and her colleagues identified that the ozone-destruction process was triggered by hydrochloric acid in the stratosphere dissolving in the smoke aerosols.Hydrochloric acid dissolved about a thousand times more readily in the smoke aerosols than in the \u201cthe normal sulphuric acid and water stratospheric particles\u201d, Solomon said.\u201cFrom a scientific point of view, it\u2019s very exciting to see this brand new effect,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom a planetary point of view \u2026 it would be just tragic to have mankind screw up solving the ozone hole by deciding that we\u2019re going to [allow] a lot more of these fires if we don\u2019t mitigate climate change.\u201dSolomon added that it was important to determine whether the smoke from fires in Australia \u2013 where native forests are dominated by eucalypts \u2013 differed in composition from fires in other areas. \u201cI don\u2019t really see a chemical reason why that would be so, but it needs to be looked at.\u201d",

Concerns have been raised that the huge subsidies in the plan could lure the UK\u2019s key green industries across the Atlantic.\u201cInstead of grasping this historic moment the government has been left trailing behind the Inflation Reduction Act and is currently failing to capitalise on the opportunities a green transition will provide. Companies are making investment decisions now and in six months\u2019 time the UK will be even further behind,\u201d Burke said.He argued that while the government was right to prioritise investment, the focus should be on technologies such as onshore wind that will reduce emissions in the short term and ensure energy security.Ana Musat, an executive director at RenewableUK, which represents onshore wind developers, said the plans did \u201cnot go far enough to attract the investment we need in the renewable energy sector\u201d amid \u201cglobal competition for investment in renewable energy projects [which] is fiercer than ever\u201d.\u201cWe need much more than a \u2018business as usual\u2019 approach to kickstart investment on the level we need to boost energy security, cut consumer bills and reach net zero,\u201d Musat said. \u201cWithout that, we won\u2019t land the UK-wide economic benefits of building up new clean energy supply chains, as they will go elsewhere where the investment environment is more conducive and attractive.\u201dMinisters are also expected by the end of the week to publish a revised plan to reduce the UK\u2019s carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, after a successful legal challenge by Friends of the Earth, ClientEarth and Good Law Project against the original plan.Mike Childs, Friends of the Earth\u2019s head of policy, said the groups lawyers were poised to act if the revised plan fell short. He warned that the government should be scaling up and accelerating the race to net zero, but the latest plans looked \u201chalf-baked, half-hearted and dangerously lacking ambition\u201d.\u201cThese announcements will do little to boost energy security, lower bills or put us on track to meet climate goals,\u201d he said.Mark Maslin, a professor of climatology at University College London, said: \u201cAt the moment the government announcement is more of the same, lacks insight to the energy issues and invests money in dead-end technology such as hydrogen.\u201cYet again the UK government has missed the opportunity to radically change the UK energy production and market. This is the time that innovative business-led initiatives are needed.\u201d",

Despite the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, having changed planning rules introduced in 2015 by the then prime minister, David Cameron, to stop onshore wind projects being blocked by a single objection, they still face higher barriers than every other form of infrastructure, including waste incinerators.Analysis of the government\u2019s renewable energy planning database shows that no applications for new onshore wind projects have been submitted since the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, claimed that the government would overturn the onshore wind ban in September 2023.At the time, the National Infrastructure Commission advised the government to go further and restore onshore wind to the government\u2019s Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects process, which would encourage more applications.The government rejected this recommendation and said the measures announced in September were enough.Analysis by Carbon Brief estimates that if onshore wind had continued to be built at the same rate it was in 2017 \u2013 before the ban started to come into effect \u2013 7GW of onshore wind would have been built. This would have knocked \u00a35.1bn off energy bills, or \u00a3182 for each UK household, in the year from July 2022 to June 2023.Greenpeace UK\u2019s policy director, Doug Parr, said: \u201cAs predicted, the government\u2019s futile planning tweaks amounted to absolutely nothing and the de facto ban is still well and truly in place. Why would a developer risk putting their cash behind a project that remains beholden to woolly guidelines and the unworkable decisions made by some local councils?\u201cOnshore wind is the cheapest, quickest and greenest way to produce energy. Ramping up production would lower energy bills, slash emissions and bolster the UK\u2019s energy security. We should be building them everywhere it makes sense to generate. But as things stand, you\u2019ve got more chance of spotting a flying pig than a new onshore windfarm in the UK.\u201dEd Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, said a Labour government would end the effective ban on onshore wind.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They are celebrating finding the lair of their prey. Small bubbles indicate the presence of an octopus, hemmed in between the rocks and coral.With two pieces of thin, sharpened steel, Ahmed gently lifts the pebbles covering the small opening, exposing a tentacle. A few minutes later, Ahmed has her catch, an Octopus cyanea, a species found in the Indo-Pacific region, off eastern Africa and the Red Sea. This one weighs about 1kg and will fetch about 400 Kenyan shillings (\u00a32) at the local market.Ahmed is known as \u201cMama Pweza\u201d (Mama octopus), and leads a team of women from nearby Shanga-Ishakani village who have taken to the water as a means of improving their families\u2019 livelihoods.Our hope is to have some of our women command the boatsAmina AhmedCrucially, they have also been preserving stretches of the ocean from over-exploitation and coral degradation by closing off an octopus fishery \u2013 a critical source of food and income \u2013 for four months.The women have defied the local custom that only men fish while they stay at home and look after the children. \u201cWe faced ridicule from society when we started,\u201d says Ahmed. \u201cThe men have now accepted our new lifestyles because they know the economic benefits of octopus fishing.\u201dIllegal and destructive fishing methods that have over-exploited nearshore reefs and damaged nesting sites have led to a decline in fish populations, with negative impacts on local people.

So everybody benefits,\u201d says Ahmed.The Pate conservancy is part of the locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) \u2013 regions supported by the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT), an umbrella body that manages several conservation projects in Kenya.Currently, there are nine LMMAs covering 746 hectares (1,840 acres), including 484 hectares of closed zones, of which 262 hectares are octopus closures \u2013 areas set aside by the community for octopus breeding that are periodically closed off and opened for fishing \u2013 benefiting more than 160 fishers.According to Hassan Yusuf, NRT director for the region, the establishment of the temporary octopus closures, or no-take zones, around Pate and Kiunga conservation areas alongside fishing-gear restrictions has led to an exponential increase in stocks and the restoration of marine life.\u201cIllegal fishing and wrong nets can easily destroy the fragile marine ecosystem,\u201d says Yusuf. \u201cOctopuses have a short lifespan, between 18 and 24 months. That is a small window for them to grow and be harvested,\u201d he says. \u201cThis short period means the women can harvest them and make money quickly.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Global DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is wonderful to see these beautiful flowers return to Stonehenge after 180 years.\u201dTo highlight and recreate the spectacle of the Stonehenge dahlia shows, floral sculptures, including a giant trilithon, have been fashioned by local growers, flower arranging clubs and professional florists within a meadow of blooms at the site\u2019s replica neolithic village.Preparations for the Stonehenge dahlia show. Photograph: Jim Holden/English HeritageDahlias grown by members of the National Dahlia Society, will be displayed on Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the visitor centre, where a prize bloom will be chosen.Families will also have the chance to pose in front of the ancient stones wearing dazzling dahlia headdresses created by an expert florist.Originating from Mexico and Central America, dahlias became widely known in the UK after the Napoleonic wars, attracting devoted followings.\u201cThey were considered really exciting and exotic plants and a challenge to grow,\u201d said Crawley. \u201cA hype grew up around them and dahlia shows began to be organised.\u201dThe Salisbury Plain Dahlia Society was set up in 1838 with its shows at first taking place in the grounds of the Crown Inn in Everleigh.From 1842-45, Lady Antrobus, whose husband Sir Edmund Antrobus owned the land Stonehenge sits on, welcomed it to the stone circle. An advert for the event said it was \u201copen to all England\u201d and prizes would be on a \u201cliberal scale\u201d.According to the local paper, the inaugural show on 31 August 1842 was hugely popular: \u201cThe extreme novelty to selecting Stonehenge for a dahlia exhibition, and a delightful sunshine, attracted, as was expected, most of the fashionables of the neighbourhood to the spot.\u201cSuch a scene of gaiety was never before witnessed on Salisbury Plain \u2026 Parties of gentlemen and elegantly dressed ladies were scattered about in all directions.\u201dBut it wasn\u2019t just the upper classes that attended. \u201cThough it was organised by the gentry, it mixed people together,\u201d said Crawley. \u201cYou had local fashionable people who came to promenade but everyone from Salisbury seemed to have emptied out on to the plain.John Keynes, the honorary secretary of the Salisbury Plain Dahlia Society and grandfather of the economist John Maynard Keynes, won a prize for his floral \u201cdevice\u201d \u2013 a wire sculpture covered in blooms \u2013 of the Antrobus coat of arms.The show lasted four years at Stonehenge before moving to another venue. \u201cIt\u2019s a tiny dot in the life of Stonehenge but important,\u201d Crawley said. \u201cIt\u2019s how people experienced the stones at one point in the 19th century.\u201dOver the decades to come, dahlias fell in and out of fashion, sometimes dismissed as gaudy and vulgar, but in 2023 are very much \u00e0 la mode.Sophie Powell, of London florists U.FL.O (Unidentified Floral Object), who has made headdresses out of dahlias for the exhibition, said: \u201cDahlias keep the summer going. The colours are amazing and they are long-lasting \u2013 very helpful to florists.\u201dAmong those competing this weekend is Graham Young, a lorry driver from nearby Shrewton, who has won prizes for his blooms and said his favourite type was \u201cBlyton softer gleam\u201d, a small ball dahlia.Gardening writer and broadcaster Arthur Parkinson said he was excited that the story of the shows was being told \u2013 and the joy of dahlias highlighted. \u201cThe heroes for me are the single and anemone varieties, which literally give life to a garden, brimming as they are with nectar and pollen for our precious pollinators.\u201dMichael Bowyer, the creative director of flowers at Salisbury Cathedral, who has worked with groups of arrangers to create \u201cIndian wedding garlands\u201d out of dahlias for the weekend, said, like many, he had known nothing of the Stonehenge shows until now. \u201cIt had faded into history,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely it\u2019s back.\u201d This article was amended on 29 September 2023.

The water that flanks New York City has risen by about 9in, or 22cm, since 1950 and major flooding events from storms could be up to four times more frequent than now by the end of the century due to the combination of sea level rise and hurricanes strengthened by climate change.\u201cA deeply concentrated population of 8.4 million people faces varying degrees of hazard from inundation in New York City,\u201d researchers wrote in the new study, published in the Earth\u2019s Future journal.The authors added that the risks faced by New York City will be shared by many other coastal cities around the world as the climate crisis deepens. \u201cThe combination of tectonic and anthropogenic subsidence, sea level rise, and increasing hurricane intensity imply an accelerating problem along coastal and riverfront areas,\u201d they wrote.This trend is being magnified by the sheer bulk of New York City\u2019s built infrastructure. The researchers calculated that the city\u2019s structures, which include the famous Empire State Building and Chrysler Building, weigh a total of 1.68tn lbs, which is roughly equivalent to the weight of 140 million elephants.This enormous heft is pushing down on a jumble of different materials found in New York City\u2019s ground. While many of the largest buildings are placed upon solid bedrock, such as schist, there is a mixture of other sands and clays that have been build over, adding to a sinking effect that is naturally occurring anyway along much of the US east coast as the land reacts to the retreat of huge glaciers following the end of the last ice age.\u201cIt\u2019s not something to panic about immediately but there\u2019s this ongoing process that increases the risk of inundation from flooding,\u201d said Tom Parsons, a geophysicist at the US Geological Survey, who led the new research.\u201cThe softer the soil, the more compression there is from the buildings. It wasn\u2019t a mistake to build such large buildings in New York but we\u2019ve just got to keep in mind every time you build something there you push down the ground a little bit more.\u201dIn 2012, New York was hit by Hurricane Sandy, which flooded parts of the subway and caused widespread damage, including power blackouts. Then, in 2021, Hurricane Ida flooded areas of the city, causing several people to drown. Scientists say both events were worsened by the effects of global heating.Parsons said that New York and other coastal cities \u201chave to get planning for this. If you get repeated exposure to seawater, you can corrode steel and destabilize buildings, which you clearly don\u2019t want. Flooding also kills people, too, which is probably the greatest concern.\u201d",

All Libyans are brothers,\u201d protesters chanted, calling for unity in a country left politically fractured by more than a decade of conflict and chaos.Mansour, a student taking part in the demonstration, said he wanted an urgent investigation into the collapse of the dams, which \u201cmade us lose thousands of our beloved people\u201d.Another protester, Taha Miftah, said the demonstration was a message that \u201cthe governments have failed to manage the crisis\u201d, adding that the parliament was especially to blame.The full death toll has yet to emerge and officials have given widely varying numbers. The Libyan Red Crescent has said at least 11,300 people died and more than 10,000 are missing. The World Health Organization has confirmed 3,922 deaths.Last week, Saleh sought to deflect blame from authorities, describing the flood as an \u201cunprecedented natural disaster\u201d and saying people should not focus on what could or should have been done.Derna mapBut commentators have drawn attention to a series of flood warnings, including an academic paper published last year by a hydrologist outlining the city\u2019s vulnerability to floods and the urgent need to maintain the dams that protected it.Swathes of Derna remain a muddy ruin roamed by stray dogs, with families still searching for bodies in the rubble. Angry residents say the disaster could have been prevented. Officials acknowledge that a contract to repair the dams after 2007 was never completed and blamed insecurity.Libya has been a failed state for more than a decade, with no government exercising nationwide authority since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011. The Libyan National Army, which holds sway in the east, has controlled Derna since 2019.For several years before that it was in the hands of militant groups, including local branches of Islamic State and al-Qaida.",

        "text": "The US chemical industry likely spent over $110m during the last two election cycles deploying lobbyists to kill dozens of pieces of PFAS legislation and slow administrative regulation around \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, a new analysis of federal lobbying documents has found.The industry\u2019s onslaught was effective: only eight pieces of legislation that targeted PFAS made it through Congress, the paper prepared by the Food and Water Watch (FWW) nonprofit found.\u201cThere\u2019s an extreme amount of money that\u2019s going into fighting [PFAS legislation],\u201d said Amanda Starbuck, FWW\u2019s research director and the lead author on the report. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to win these fights when there\u2019s so much funding being put in from the opposing side.\u201dPFAS are a class of about 14,000 compounds used to make products resist water, stains and heat. They are known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down, and they have been linked to cancer, high cholesterol, liver disease, kidney disease, fetal complications and other serious health problems.As the dangers from PFAS have come into sharper focus over the last decade, lawmakers, the Environmental Protection Agency and other administrative agencies have come under an ever-increasing amount of pressure to rein in the chemicals use and clean up pollution. Chemical manufacturers\u2019 spending has jumped in response, the report noted\u201cThe chemical and associated industries are powerful and have used their army of lobbyists and campaign finance war chests to thwart meaningful action,\u201d the paper states.It looked at lobbying records for eight major producers, such as 3M, Chemours, and Honeywell. During the 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 election cycles, over 130 PFAS bills were introduced in Congress, the report noted. Of the eight that passed, only two were stand alone bills, while PFAS provisions were included in several larger pieces of legislation, like the National Defense Authorization Act.Though the report identified over $110m in spending in lobbying records that mention PFAS legislation or rules, it is unclear what portion of that was spent solely on PFAS proposals because lobbying documents are not specific.The American Chemistry Council, which represents major PFAS manufacturers, accounted for $58m of that total, and dispatched lobbyists on numerous bills including those targeting environmental and drinking water standards. The petrochemical industry and groups represented by the US Chamber of Commerce Coalition also focused heavily on PFAS issues.Industry put up the fiercest resistance to the PFAS Action Act, versions of which were introduced in each cycle. The bill would have designated PFOA and PFOS \u2013 two PFAS compounds that are among the most dangerous and are widely polluting the nation\u2019s water \u2013 as hazardous substances under US Superfund law. The designation, reserved for the nation\u2019s most dangerous chemicals, would have made manufacturers financially responsible for the cleanup.Eight PFAS manufacturers FWW tracked paid a combined total of 28 lobbyists to work on the 2019 version of the PFAS Action Act.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Committee chair, Democrat Tom Carper, received about $38,000, while Shelley Moore Capito, a ranking Republican senator, received about $85,000.Still, the tide may be shifting. Increased public scrutiny, media attention, and a growing body of independent research have caught the public\u2019s attention, and that\u2019s pressuring officials and lawmakers to act in a way that is largely unprecedented for chemical pollution.\u201cThe familiarity is huge, as is people understanding and being rightfully outraged,\u201d Starbuck said. \u201cMomentum is building.\u201d",

        "text": "The climate activist Greta Thunberg is due to appear in court in late July after being charged with refusing to obey police orders during an anti-oil protest in the Swedish port city of Malm\u00f6 last month, local media have reported.The charge, believed to be Thunberg\u2019s first, comes after the 20-year-old climate campaigner joined a six-day protest organised by the environmental group Take Back the Future at the city\u2019s oil terminal on 19 June.Sydsvenskan reported that the activist, who began her school strike for climate at the age of 15 in Stockholm and rose to international prominence through the Fridays for Future youth climate movement, was detained with three others.The four were part of a group of about 20 protesters blocking the road and climbing on tankers to stop them entering or leaving the terminal, police told the newspaper, but unlike others had refused to comply with orders to leave.\u201cThe prosecutor has filed charges against a young woman who on 19 June this year participated in a climate demonstration which, according to the prosecution, caused disruption to traffic in Malm\u00f6,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office said in a brief statement.The statement did not name Thunberg, but a spokesperson confirmed it was her. The prosecutor, Charlotte Ottosen, told Sydsvenskan that freedom to demonstrate did not extend to the right to cause a disturbance for others.The protesters were dragged away from the scene because they \u201cdid not obey\u201d individual police instructions to move off the road, Ottosen said, adding that the process was filmed. She said similar offences \u201cusually lead to fines\u201d.Thunberg wrote in an Instagram post on the day she joined the protest that the climate crisis was \u201calready a matter of life and death for countless people. We choose to not be bystanders, and instead physically stop the fossil fuel infrastructure.\u201dThunberg, who is said to be planning to defend herself at the district court appearance on 24 July, would not be available for comment in the meantime, a spokesperson told Swedish media.Take Back the Future said the terminal\u2019s fossil fuel cargoes were a bigger problem than that its activists were being prosecuted. \u201cThe real crime is inside the gates we blocked,\u201d its spokesperson, Irma Kjellstr\u00f6m, said.\u201cWe will continue our opposition to this type of activity,\u201d said Kjellstr\u00f6m, who has also been charged. \u201cWe are not going to wait and contribute to the fossil fuel industry continuing to take our dreams away from us.\u201dThunberg was twice briefly detained by police in Oslo during a demonstration against windfarms on Indigenous people\u2019s land rights in March, and in January during protests in Germany against the demolition of a village to make way for a coalmine.",

The diarist Francis Kilvert was enraptured: \u201cOh, Aberedw, Aberedw. Would God I might dwell and die by thee.\u201dThere\u2019s a friendly village pub here and an old church, dedicated to a seventh century Welsh saint, \u201cHen Gewydd y Gwlaw\u201d (\u201cOld Cewydd of the rain\u201d). The priest and historian Giraldus Cambrensis railed against the appropriation of Saint Cewydd by English ecclesiastics \u2013 the particularly rapacious monks of Winchester renamed him Saint Swithun, buried his relics in their own cathedral, and broadcast the legend.Aberedw church\u2019s ancient foundation is apparent: the yew trees in its circular burying ground are huge. Below is Afon Edw, one of the loveliest tributaries of the Wye, once revered for its salmon and strictly keepered for English anglers.Kilvert tells an amusing story of local poachers who, on the brink of arrest and probable transportation while in possession of fish, escaped by hiding the salmon in a box-tomb. In such a busy churchyard, the reek of rotting fish went unnoticed. When the capping slab was shifted for the next interment, fishbones decorated the coffin within.The entrance to Ogof Llywelyn (Llywelyn\u2019s cave). Photograph: radnorimages/AlamyI took a glass of Welsh ale at the Seven Stars. Bar talk was in the soft burr of the Marches. A hundred yards along the road is a path leading to what was originally called Cell Cewydd, but is now Ogof Llywelyn, or Llywelyn\u2019s cave. It\u2019s a scrattly climb to a square, dank rock shelter where Llew Olaf \u2013 Llywelyn the Last, the last true Prince of Wales and the final royal defender of Welsh liberty \u2013 dozed away the last December night of his life in 1282.Next morning he splashed on horseback across a ford of the Gwy and made for the town of Builth. When the castellan refused him admission, he rode on northwards, and at Cilmeri met his death.In the mustiness of the cave I brood on his awful fate while outside rain pelts down, as it has done on every subsequent day these last few weeks. On a rock by the entrance someone has painted Owain Glyndwr\u2019s standard. A wind rattles the oak leaves, releasing torrents of drops. Jackdaws in the wood noisily applaud.

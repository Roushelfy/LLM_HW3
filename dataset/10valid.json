        "text": "Last summer’s drought may have reduced butterfly populations this year because grasses and flowers that would usually feed caterpillars withered and died in the heatwave, scientists say.People are being urged to help researchers understand the impact of extreme weather on British butterflies by counting the number and species they see this summer as part of the world’s largest insect survey.The Big Butterfly Count runs for three weeks from Friday. Members of the public are asked to spend 15 minutes in a local park, garden or green space recording the butterflies they see.So far this year, numbers of common butterflies including small tortoiseshells and peacocks whose caterpillars were feeding on nettles late last summer are significantly lower than normal.Dr Zoë Randle, a senior surveys officer at Butterfly Conservation, said: “What we’re really concerned about is the survival rates of caterpillars from last summer. Small tortoiseshells have had a dreadful year so far, as have peacock butterflies, and the whites are doing quite poorly as well.“We want people to take part in the count to generate really important data so we can get a handle on how last summer’s drought affected butterfly species.”There are fears that grass-feeding species have been struck particularly severely by last summer’s heatwave, which turned the grass brown in meadows, fields and parks. Many experts are reporting lower numbers of ringlets than usual, but apparently good numbers of meadow browns and marbled whites have emerged earlier than normal. The Big Butterfly Count will help establish whether or not these species are bouncing back.Randle said that after the 1976 drought it took many of these widespread butterfly species a decade to recover their numbers.With many butterfly species in Britain at the northern edge of their European range, a warming climate should boost their numbers, but data shows that 80% of Britain’s 59 species are declining in either abundance or distribution, with butterflies vanishing from half the places where they once flew since 1976.Last year’s Big Butterfly Count produced the lowest abundance of butterflies in the 13 years of the popular survey. Conservationists attribute these declines to a combination of habitat loss, industrial farming and climatic changes. As temperatures rise, many butterflies cannot move north across inhospitable farmland to find suitable new sites, although a few more mobile species such as the purple emperor and the comma are managing to do this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Once ubiquitous garden species such as the small tortoiseshell – whose caterpillars feed on nettles – have become relatively scarce in southern Britain but the butterfly has been much more widely recorded in Scotland and Northern Ireland.Last year there were almost 100,000 15-minute counts, with participants spending a combined total of 2.5 years looking for butterflies. The count, which is run by Butterfly Conservation, is supported by Sir David Attenborough, King Charles and Chris Packham, who launches it this year, and the information gathered helps inform conservation projects as well as the government’s conservation priorities.",

If Shell finds a buyer who wants more than 30%, then Ithaca could add a further 19.99% of its own interest to create a working interest of almost 50%.Alan Bruce, the Ithaca CEO, said the Shell agreement was a meaningful step towards developing the Cambo field, which could be “a key asset in helping maintain the UK’s future energy security”.Shell announced in late 2021 it would pull out of any future investment in Cambo in what many climate campaigners had believed would deal a “deathblow” to the project.The oilfield’s prospects were revived last year when Ithaca Energy became the majority owner after paying about $1.5bn (£1.2bn) to buy private-equity backed Siccar Point Energy, the operator of the field.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "The federal government has called on one of Australia’s biggest retailers, Kmart Group, to support an industry-led textile recycling scheme, or risk regulation.Spearheaded by the Australian Fashion Council (AFC), the Seamless initiative is designed to tackle clothing waste through a levy system to increase the number of garments being resold, repaired, reworn and recycled.Although it was launched in June, the Wesfarmers-owned Kmart Group, which includes Kmart and Target stores, has not signed up to it.If it’s broken, they fix it: four fashion brands that give their garments a second lifeRead more“I encourage the Kmart Group to join with brands like Big W, David Jones and The Iconic to take responsibility for the huge amounts of textile waste they send to landfill,” the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, told Guardian Australia.“The alternative to this program isn’t a weaker scheme with a lower levy, it’s government regulation.”Designed to tackle the 200,000 tonnes of clothing waste Australians send to landfill every year, the circularity scheme is the product of a $1m grant from the federal government awarded to the AFC in 2021.It imposes a 4 cent levy on every garment sold, to be paid by brands that choose to participate, mirroring an example set by the EU. The levy will fund research into sustainability for the industry and establish the infrastructure for textile recycling.\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nAccording to four sources close to the scheme, Kmart’s opposition came after an 18-month consultation process with the AFC.Shortly before the scheme’s launch on 7 June, Kmart Group asked the environment minister to cancel the scheme’s impending announcement, the sources said.The discount retailer requested a six-month delay so it could create its own report on the matter and wanted the voluntary levy imposed by the scheme to be reduced or calculated based on a garment’s value instead of the number of units sold, according to the sources.Kmart also lobbied other companies, including Country Road Group, to withdraw support for the scheme, the sources said. The Country Road Group declined to comment.A Kmart Group spokesperson said the retailer would welcome a regulated scheme which it believed would ensure monies raised are spent on recycling clothes rather than funding roles.“Kmart Group supports the introduction of a regulated extended product responsibility scheme. A voluntary scheme has not delivered the participation from both Australian and international retailers needed to fund the real operational costs of sortation and recycling, as well as the investment required to build this infrastructure at scale onshore,” the spokesperson said.“The limited clothing sortation and recycling infrastructure remains the major roadblock to reducing clothing waste in Australia.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Williams, Sussan and The Iconic, which all pledged an initial investment of $100,000 and will play a part in the 12-month transition phase.Dozens of other businesses have also expressed interest in participating.The chair of the Seamless transition advisory group, Rosanna Iacono, said the scheme had been created with “input from some of Australia’s largest and most influential clothing producers, but also with the participation of recyclers, charities, peak bodies, government regulators, academia and advanced innovation players”.The scheme’s architects are hopeful that more than half the industry will participate, which would create a $36m annual fund to go towards diverting 120,000 tonnes of textiles from landfill by 2027.Kmart and Target bring in an estimated 20% of all garments imported to Australia according to modelling done by the AFC. In August, they reported annual revenue of $10.6bn, while parent company Wesfarmers, which also owns hardware chain Bunnings, reported revenue of $43.6bn.Every year, 1.42bn items of clothing arrive in Australia and approximately two-thirds are thrown away. Just 7,000 tonnes of textiles are downcycled, whereby products are broken down, into insulation, pellets or board. This story was amended on 16 November 2023 to clarify that one of the companies lobbied by Kmart was Country Road Group, not Country Road the brand.

        "text": "A farmer has been jailed for “the worst case of riverside destruction” seen by environmental authorities after ripping up 1.5km of the River Lugg in Herefordshire, wrecking the habitats of otters, kingfishers, trout and salmon.Following the first prosecution under the farming rules for water legislation, John Price was jailed for 12 months, ordered to pay prosecution costs of £600,000 and disqualified from being a director of a limited company for three years after admitting seven charges related to his “wanton” destruction of one of the country’s most unspoiled rivers.The Environment Agency and Natural England, which brought the case against Price, said it would take decades to recover from the damage meted out by the farmer, who was also handed a restoration order at Kidderminster magistrates court, requiring him to restore the river.Price used heavy machinery including bulldozers and excavators to dredge and re-profile a 1.5km stretch of the River Lugg at Kingsland, Herefordshire, destroying the riverbed and banks, the Environment Agency said.The unconsented works were in breach of several regulations, including the Reduction and Prevention of Agricultural Diffuse Pollution (England) Regulations 2018, also known as the farming rules for water, and operations prohibited in the notification of a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), which persisted despite Price being issued with a stop notice.Due to the exceptionally high diversity of wildlife, the Lugg is a designated SSSI, with 121 river plant species that provide habitat for invertebrates, fish and birds.The damage to the river and banks removed the habitats of hundreds of these species, including otters, kingfishers and salmon, as well as destroying trees, aquatic plant life and invertebrates.The Environment Agency said it was expected to take decades to re-establish mature trees to provide the stability, cover and shade to restore the diversity of the river. Fish, plants, native crayfish and birds may take years to make a gradual return to previous populations.Speaking after the verdict, Emma Johnson, the area manager for Natural England, said: “The destruction of this section of the River Lugg was devastating for the abundance and range of species which thrived in this river.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "In April, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, suggested that severe drought would become “one of the central political and territorial debates of our country in the coming years”. That stark warning surely applies to southern Europe as a whole, as the prospect of another summer crisis looms, following a disastrously dry winter.An absence of melting snow from the Alps has left Italy’s Po River as shallow as during last year’s searingly hot summer. In January and February, France recorded the highest number of rain-free days since records began, and water restrictions are in place in the Pyrénées-Orientales region. About 90% of mainland Portugal is suffering from drought, judged to be severe in one-fifth of the country. In Spain, from Catalonia to Andalucía, unseasonable heat has contributed to reservoirs drying up and a disastrous drop in olive oil production. By the middle of this month, southern Spain had received barely 30% of expected rainfall. As temperatures continue to rise, and Europe warms faster than the global average, drought across vast swathes of territory is simply becoming the norm.There are obvious moves that can be made to alleviate water shortages. A quarter of drinking water in Europe is lost because of leaky pipelines. In Italy – one of the worst offenders in this respect – a drought taskforce has been created to improve water infrastructure. In France, Emmanuel Macron has set a 10% water savings target for all sectors of the economy by 2030 and demanded far greater reuse of wastewater. New, low-energy desalination techniques will be key to guaranteeing future supplies of water for human consumption.There is, however, no foreseeable technical fix that will allow difficult decisions over an increasingly scarce resource to be evaded. The politics of a new, parched reality will be fraught and contested, particularly in relation to food production in transformed terrain. In France, plans for new reservoirs to irrigate farmland have led to violent clashes between police and environmental protesters, who argue that agricultural practices need to become less water-intensive.In Andalucía, regional proposals to legalise irrigation in part of the Doñana Natural Space – one the world’s most important wetlands – have become a wedge issue ahead of local elections this weekend. Vox, a far-right party which has made political gains through downplaying the severity of the climate emergency, has positioned itself as a champion of the strawberry farmers who would benefit from the plans. In Seville, thousands have demonstrated against the project, which has been condemned by both Madrid and the European Commission.Global heating will eventually force rural economies such as those in Andalucía to diversify to survive. They will require substantial assistance from both national governments and the European Union to do so. More needs to be done to help those who find themselves at the sharp end of an emerging crisis for agricultural production. An absence of proper economic support will breed dangerous resentment in regions that have traditionally prided themselves on supplying Europe’s fruit, vegetable and cereal needs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Half a billion years ago, the ocean was filling up with animals for the first time, including scuttling trilobites and spiky worms. Little is known, however, about what was happening further down the food chain.Now, a British palaeontologist believes he may have found fossilised phytoplankton – forerunners of the tiny but vital algae that today suck masses of carbon out of the atmosphere and produce about half the oxygen we breathe. The fossils, dating back to the Cambrian period – 538m to 485m years ago – are microscopic, roughly the width of a human hair, and lived in the ocean back when there was no life on land.Tom Harvey, from Leicester University, discovered them in rocks he had collected from a logging trail in Newfoundland, Canada, which he was examining using a microscope to search for animal skin. Instead, he came across a cluster of spiny objects stuck together in neat geometric clusters.They were unlike anything he’d seen before. “The cells were quite big, they formed quite a large colony that has this amazing geometry,” he says. They reminded him of the pattern of butterfly eggs laid on a cabbage leaf, but he had no idea what he was looking at. “It was just too mysterious,” Harvey says. “I didn’t even want to hazard a guess.”A quarry in Newfoundland, Canada, where the fossils were found. Photograph: University of LeicesterIt was years before he found more of these microfossils. The process involves dissolving rocks in powerful acid, leaving carbon-based fossils intact, floating in a watery residue. Harvey then uses a microscope to search each drop of liquid, and suck up individual clusters of cells with an eyedropper. Eventually, he had a collection of a few dozen similar-looking fossils.Childhood memories were stirred of pond dipping and examining pond water under a microscope, giving Harvey the idea that his new fossils – although found on land – could be phytoplankton.The discovery is published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B , which describes fossils shaped like little flat plates and rings, just one cell thick; the closest match Harvey could find today are algae that live in ponds and lakes.Harvey believes that, judging by their neat, symmetrical shapes, these colonies formed in a similar way to some living freshwater phytoplankton: rather than dividing into ever bigger blobs of cells, the parent plankton cells split off daughter colonies in a single step, then let them go.Discovered in the deep: the squid that sees both ways at onceRead moreLiving phytoplankton do this when they sense animals nearby. Chemicals wafting through the water from grazing creatures, such as water fleas, stimulate the plankton to divide and become spinier, which makes them more difficult to eat.Harvey thinks the ancient phytoplankton may have done the same thing. If he’s right, then this is the earliest evidence that animals had begun filtering seawater for phytoplankton, a critical part of the way ocean ecosystems work today.The discovery could help fill a huge gap in the fossil record for phytoplankton. The main varieties living in the ocean now can be traced to only about 200 to 100m years ago, during the time of the dinosaurs, compared with Harvey’s fossils, which are about 510m years old.00:01:17Scientists discover why thousands of octopuses huddle in a deep-sea crevice – videoHoards of microfossils date back earlier in Earth’s history but remain stubbornly enigmatic. Palaeontologists call them “acritarchs”, but don’t know what they were. Some could be cells broken from phytoplankton colonies similar to those that Harvey has found. He hopes his fossils could help other palaeontologists identify more of these colonies by showing them what to look for.“I think they’ll be out there on microscope slides and collections in museums all around the world,” he says. This article was amended on 9 November 2023 to clarify the type of plankton that this discovery could help.",

It has sent tens of thousands of food parcels to communities isolated by the lack of river transport.The region is under pressure from the El Niño weather phenomenon, with the volume of rainfall in the northern Amazon below the historical average.The most serious problem for Indigenous communities that have no running water is sanitation now that the river water cannot be drunk, Apiam coordinator Mariazinha Bare said.“The smaller rivers have dried up and turned to mud,” Bare said in an interview. “Indigenous people have to walk long distances in the rainforest to find potable water, and the poor quality of water is making people ill,” she said.Impassable rivers have made it harder for medical assistance to reach Amazon villages, Bare said, and rain is not expected until the end of November or early December when the rivers and their fish population normally renew themselves.The Madeira river to the south-west is no longer navigable in its upper reaches, isolating Indigenous villages and non-Indigenous communities that rely on collecting fruit in the rainforest but cannot move their produce out.Ivaneide Bandeira, who heads the Kaninde Indigenous organization in the state of Rondonia, said isolated non-Indigenous communities were asking Indigenous villages for food.She said the smoke from forest fires was worse than ever, aggravating the climate crisis and affecting the health of the elderly and children.“It is not just the El Niño current. Deforestation continues with these fires,” she said by telephone. “The agricultural advance does not stop. They are destroying everything, as if they do not see what is happening to nature.”",

        "text": "The decision taken by Plymouth’s Tory council leader, Richard Bingley, to chop down more than 100 mature trees under cover of darkness earlier this month was damaging to the city as well as the horse chestnut, silver birch, pear, apple and other specimens that were removed. Armada Way, the pedestrianised boulevard that runs south through the city centre to the sea, is a rare postwar conservation area and ought to be a national showpiece. Instead, ugly images of debris strewn among the modern architecture have upset and angered local people and conservationists. They may also set back efforts to boost the city by attracting tourists.The upset and anger are more than justified by events. A consultation regarding the proposed regeneration of the city centre showed that a majority of locals do not support it. A campaign group, Save the Trees of Armada Way (Straw), gathered a petition of more than 16,000 names. Yet the council ploughed on until it was served with a court injunction by campaigners. On Monday, Mr Bingley resigned, ahead of a council meeting.But the chainsaws were not the work of one man. The whole administration stands discredited ahead of May’s local elections. Even the two local Conservative MPs, Johnny Mercer and Sir Gary Streeter, believe that Labour should now take over the council (so far Labour’s Tudor Evans has resisted this, saying that the decision should be made at the ballot box). The infighting and incompetence of local Tories lie behind this declaration of no confidence. Last year, one former councillor, David Downie, said that he was “very concerned” about the Conservative cabinet’s lack of experience. Mr Bingley is on record as having said that people shouldn’t “worry too much about climate change”.Such cavalier attitudes are outdated. It is a sign of progress that so many people now recognise the importance of trees, not only as attractive local features but as wildlife habitats with a role in sequestering carbon and keeping streets cool. Developments for new housing or other infrastructure should work around them. Promises to plant new trees are no substitute for looking after those that already exist. Where developers present plans that are harmful to nature, councils must push back and demand alternatives.In its dismissal of local people’s feedback, this council showed itself to be as high-handed with voters as with the environment. Just as happened in Sheffield, where a Labour council destroyed public trust through its handling of protests over the removal of street trees, Plymouth’s leaders adopted a bunker mentality. Spending £12.7m of levelling up funds within the allotted timeframe was what mattered. They believed their plan to be a good one, and that was that.Except it wasn’t, and their poor stewardship of precious local assets has been shown up. Clearly there are lessons here for Plymouth, where control of the council has switched between Labour and the Tories, and previous regeneration projects have produced good results. But there are wider lessons too. Cambridgeshire county council, which is run by a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition, has just approved plans to cut down an orchard to make way for a road. In too many areas, and in local parties of different stripes, politicians’ actions are failing to live up to their climate pledges. Development that takes us further away from our climate and biodiversity goals should no longer be called by that misleading name.",

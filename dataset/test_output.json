A separate review earlier this year found there were 1,504 discharges in 2022 on beaches supposed to be free from such pollution.Water companies have been under increasing pressure to clean up their act amid growing outrage over payouts of more than \u00a32bn a year on average since 1991.The poll, carried out by Savanta for the Liberal Democrats, spoke to 2,272 UK adults between 21 and 23 July. Just over 30% said they typically went sea swimming during the summer, and of these 23% said they would not this year because of sewage dumping by water companies.More than two in five of the regular beachgoers also said they were less likely to visit the British seaside this summer because of sewage discharges.The government has said it will allow the Environment Agency to impose unlimited fines on rule-breaking water companies. Penalties are currently capped at \u00a3250,000.The Lib Dems have been calling for a sewage tax on annual profits and a ban on water company executive bonuses.\u201cCoastal communities are at the mercy of water companies who unapologetically discharge raw sewage into popular swimming spots,\u201d Tim Farron, the Lib Dems\u2019 environment spokesperson said. \u201cThis Conservative government needs to stop letting water companies off the hook and finally ban these disgusting sewage discharges and defend our tourism sector.\u201dCathryn Ross, Thames Water\u2019s interim chief executive, recently described many of her company\u2019s pipes as \u201cageing assets\u201d that should have been replaced. Thames Water does not discharge into coastal waters as the area the company covers is inland.Water companies are supposed to release raw sewage only after heavy rains, to stop sewage backing up the system and risking flooding, with the most recent data showing they had collectively dumped sewage 372,533 times in 2021 and 301,091 times in 2022.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \u201cBanning discharges overnight without any plan to fix storm overflows is reckless and would see sewage backing up into people\u2019s homes and the street.\u201cThe secretary of state demanded action plans on every storm overflow in the country and our storm overflow discharge reduction plan requires water companies to spend \u00a356bn to eliminate the harm from storm overflows \u2013 the largest infrastructure investment in water company history.\u201dA Water UK spokesperson said standards at beaches had improved exponentially since the 1990s but that the industry recognised it had been slow \u201cto tackle the harm to our seas caused by sewage overflows\u201d.\u201cOver the next seven years, water and sewerage companies plan to spend \u00a310bn \u2013 a tripling on current levels of investment \u2013 in the biggest transformation of our sewers since the Victorian era,\u201d they said. \u201cAs part of this, bathing waters will be prioritised and among the first to receive funding.\u201d",

This climate pattern can drive droughts and heat in Australia, and can push up global temperatures.While the World Meteorological Organization and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have already said an El Ni\u00f1o is in place, the bureau said this week the atmosphere was still not giving a consistent signal \u2013 mainly the changes in the trade winds \u2013 that were typical of an El Ni\u0144o.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nAccording to the bureau\u2019s latest long range outlook, released on Thursday, most of the country is likely to see warmer than average temperatures out to October, and lower than average rainfall.Braganza said that forecast stood, regardless of whether an El Ni\u00f1o did develop. He said if El Ni\u00f1o was declared, it would give the bureau more confidence that beyond October the outlook would remain mostly warm and dry throughout the rest of the summer.According to the BoM, warmer than average temperatures and lower than average rainfall is likely until October. Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/EPALooking at El Ni\u00f1os of the past, Braganza said typically you would see a tongue of warm ocean water extending from the west coast of central America across the equatorial Pacific.This would usually have a horseshoe-shaped area of cooler water surrounding it off Australia\u2019s northeast that sets up a reversal of the trade winds, locking the El Ni\u00f1o in place.\u201cThis does not look like that canonical El Ni\u00f1o,\u201d said Braganza. \u201cThe western Pacific and the Indian Ocean are quite warm and the tropical Atlantic is extremely warm at the moment.\u201dDifferences in temperature across different parts of the ocean can drive large scale weather patterns like El Ni\u00f1o, but right now it was warm across most of the ocean.Braganza said it was a \u201cpoint of conjecture\u201d that these widespread record ocean temperatures \u201ccould be making it harder for the El Ni\u00f1o to get going in the atmosphere\u201d.\u201cThe bottom line is that we are adding heat to the ocean and that has to be modulating the ocean\u2019s natural variability to some degree, but we don\u2019t have a clear scientific understanding of that at the moment.\u201dNSW warned of bushfire dangers as dry El Ni\u00f1o looms after \u2018prolific\u2019 vegetation growthRead moreBraganza said as the world\u2019s climate had been changed, the ability to forecast based on past events had been compromised.The bureau still considers there to be a 70% chance of an El Ni\u00f1o developing later this year.Braganza said forecasts were also showing that another phenomenon in the Indian Ocean that can reduce rainfall was likely to develop over spring. If that happens and an El Ni\u00f1o also locks into place \u201cwe will likely strengthen our forecast advice\u201d, Braganza said.Some climate scientists and bushfire experts have expressed concern that after three consecutive years of very wet La Ni\u00f1a summers, there is now a lot of grass and vegetation that could become fuel for fires.\u201cThe fuel growth is remarkable and in our new climate system, how quickly can we dry out that fuel?\u201d Braganza said.Climate scientists are concerned that after three years of La Ni\u00f1a, the amount of vegetation for fire fuel is large. Photograph: Sean Blocksidge/DFES\u201cYou would say it won\u2019t be like a 2019 event, but our message is to prepare for a summer where it could be significant in terms of heatwaves and fires. But I\u2019m less worried than I would be if we had had two years of drought.\u201dAnd Braganza said meteorologists were also watching closely for any climate impacts from a significant loss of Antarctic sea ice this year compared with previous years.Less sea ice had the potential to contribute to changes in wind and weather patterns, he said.\u201cWhat we are seeing now due to the lack of growth is that instead of sea ice extending into the mid-latitudes, you now have dark ocean. That changes the solar radiation balance in the southern hemisphere.\u201d",

This is likely to reduce the salinity and change the water\u2019s colour.\u201cThat might be what makes it go away,\u201d Wolfe said.This 8 November 2023 photo provided by Leslie Diamond shows the pond at the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge on Maui, Hawaii, that turned pink on 30 October 2023.

Just 20 turbines have been approved since 2014 as a result.It has taken years of campaigning \u2013 and squabbling \u2013 within the government and the backbenches to get to this point, which could make it slightly easier to build renewables.Though what the housing secretary has proposed is better than the previous situation, it still leaves onshore wind at a disadvantage compared with any other infrastructure project and campaigners say developers will still not invest in building windfarms if their proposals could be squashed by local councillors.It will also confine onshore wind to certain areas of the country, which Gove defined in his statement on Tuesday as \u201csuitable locations\u201d. He is loosening the requirement for a location to be deemed suitable, but other infrastructure projects are not confined to certain places in this way.Luke Clark from the trade body RenewableUK said: \u201cPreviously, the government said that suitable areas had to be identified in a local development plan. Today they have announced new ways of identifying suitable areas, as it can take some time for local development plans to be published. But other forms of energy and electricity generation do not have that requirement to only be in \u2018suitable areas\u2019. As a result, we don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to make a change to increase investment at a level we need to cut bills and increase energy security.\u201dThe updated National Planning Policy Framework statement says: \u201cExcept for applications for the repowering and life extension of existing wind turbines, a planning application for wind energy development involving one or more turbines should not be considered acceptable unless it is in an area identified as suitable for wind energy development in the development plan or a supplementary planning document; and, after consultation, it can be demonstrated that the planning impacts identified by the affected local community have been appropriately addressed and the proposal has community support.\u201d Experts say these area-based restrictions are unique to onshore wind.The shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, and the Labour party have been calling for onshore wind to be brought in line with other infrastructure projects, which do not face the same barriers.Gove\u2019s plans to give discounts on energy bills to those who live near the developments are interesting, but the truth is that all of our bills will be reduced if cheaper forms of energy are given the green light, and we rely less on expensive and planet-destroying fossil fuels.This loosening of planning rules only came about because of strong campaigning from a large group of Tory MPs, including the widely respected former Cop26 president, Alok Sharma.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The highest average in previous years was 1.28C above pre-industrial levels.Global mean near-surface temperature anomalies from 1850-1900 average, \u00b0CThe report, published on Wednesday, found there was a 66% likelihood of exceeding the 1.5C threshold in at least one year between 2023 and 2027.New record temperatures have been set in many areas around the world in the heatwaves of the past year, but those highs may only be the beginning, according to the report, as climate breakdown and the impact of a developing El Ni\u00f1o weather system combine to create heatwaves across the globe.El Ni\u00f1o is part of an oscillating weather system that develops in the Pacific. For the past three years, the world has been in the opposing phase, known as La Ni\u00f1a, which has had a dampening effect on temperature increases around the world.As La Ni\u00f1a ends and a new El Ni\u00f1o develops, there is a 98% likelihood that at least one of the next five years will be the hottest on record, the scientists found.Near-surface temperature anomalies, 12-month average in comparison with 1991-2020Taalas warned of the effects. \u201cA warming El Ni\u00f1o is expected to develop in the coming months and this will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory. This will have far-reaching repercussions for health, food security, water management and the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be prepared.\u201dThe Arctic is heating much faster than the rest of the world, and this appears to be having an impact on global weather systems, including the jet stream, which has disrupted weather across the northern hemisphere in recent years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This is particularly bad news for the Amazon, where scientists have grown increasingly concerned that a vicious cycle of heating and deforestation could tip the region from rainforest into savannah-like conditions.UN warns heat records could be broken as chance of El Ni\u00f1o risesRead moreThat could have calamitous consequences for the planet, which relies on rainforests as massive carbon sinks.Over the next five years, there is likely to be above-average rainfall in northern Europe, Alaska and northern Siberia, and the Sahel, according to the report.For each year from 2023 to 2027, the global near-surface temperature is predicted to be between 1.1C and 1.8C above the pre-industrial average, taken from the years 1850 to 1900.The world has warmed considerably in recent years. In 2015, when the Paris agreement was signed, requiring countries to hold global temperature increases to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels while \u201cpursuing efforts\u201d to hold them to 1.5C, it was forecast that the chance of temporarily exceeding the 1.5C threshold within the following five years was zero.This November, governments will meet for the Cop28 UN climate summit, where they will assess progress towards meeting the goals of the Paris agreement. Known as the \u201cglobal stocktake\u201d, this assessment is likely to show that the world is far off track to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the 43% this decade that is required to have a good chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C.",

        "text": "The world is only a few tenths of a degree away from the globally accepted goal of limiting warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. On current trends, we will shoot past the target within a decade. That\u2019s the warning from the world\u2019s leading scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In their last report while it is still feasible to stay within 1.5C, they warn that what governments do in the next few years to limit greenhouse gas emissions will determine whether temperatures keep rising dangerously or fall back to safe levels.Billions of poor people who bear the least responsibility for the climate emergency are already being hit hard. Extreme weather events such as the flash floods in Turkey or Cyclone Freddy over southern Africa, which took hundreds of lives, are becoming more common occurrences. It is unequivocal, say the scientists, that human activity has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. It is also human activity that can bring temperatures down. Cutting carbon pollution and fossil fuel use by nearly two-thirds by 2035 would give humanity a decent shot at the target. The UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, spelled out what this means: an end to new fossil fuel exploration and rich countries exiting coal, oil and gas by 2040. The UK, which is opening coalmines and approving North Sea oil and gas licences, should take note.Global emissions of carbon dioxide hit a record high last year despite green tech growth. It\u2019s the required decline in CO2 that gives climate scientists nightmares. The 2015 Paris agreement suggested the answer lay in negative emissions \u2013 where new technology would reduce the amount of carbon already in the atmosphere and buy society time. There are two ways to remove carbon dioxide. One is with land-management methods such as reforestation. The other is capturing and storing carbon underground or in the oceans. The IPCC thinks there is enough potential CO2 storage to limit global warming to 1.5C from now to 2100. However, such novel methods currently account for just 0.1% of all negative emission use. That might explain why many climate scientists have dismissed the idea as \u201cmagical thinking\u201d.The rich world has the money and the technological prowess to stop the planet from burning up. Yet climate financing has fallen far short of tackling the climate emergency. The IPCC estimates that investment in climate mitigation and adaptation is three to six times lower than where it needs to be to reach the goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C. One reason is that the world is relying on finance houses to stump up the cash. We cannot leave it to the private sector to solve global heating. Trillions of dollars of multi-year investments are needed to save humanity but companies won\u2019t risk spending when the payback may take years, or never arise. That is why the state needs to be involved in a much bigger way \u2013 but without socialising risks and allowing banks to privatise the profit.Some suggest the world should face up to the fact the 1.5C target will be missed. But changing it to a higher number would allow climate sceptics to argue that \u201cwolf\u201d had been cried. Peter Thorne, a researcher at Maynooth University in Ireland, and one of the IPCC report\u2019s authors, warned that governments, communities and individuals \u201chave made climate change somebody else\u2019s problem\u201d. Yet the deleterious effects are affecting everyone. Technology that works can solve a problem if it gets deployed. This depends on getting the right policies in place and crucially securing the funding to make it happen. None of this will materialise if politicians \u2013 and the public \u2013 see the climate emergency as somebody else\u2019s problem.",

        "text": "The government has been accused of breaking its promise to English farmers, with hundreds of millions of pounds missing from the farming budget.Ministers had promised that by the end of this parliament, they would spend \u00a32.4bn a year on agriculture. This money was to replace the EU\u2019s common agricultural policy, which paid farmers for each hectare of land they managed. Instead, the government promised that farmers could improve the natural environment and be paid handsomely for delivering public goods, thus helping nature and keeping farms in business.However, the government has still not spent the promised \u00a32.4bn a year. Figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) show an underspend of \u00a3110m in 2021/22 and \u00a3117m in 2022/23, meaning \u00a3227m of promised funds have not been spent.Agricultural businesses have been asked to sign up to environmental schemes in which they are paid for taking actions such as improving the soil and digging ponds, which are to replace the basic payments they received under direct subsidy. These direct payments are being phased out each year.The money is also spent on measures to \u201cimprove farm prosperity\u201d, so instead of receiving the money directly farmers can participate in schemes to learn how to improve their business.Farmers said they had no idea where much of the promised \u00a32.4bn farming budget is, as their direct payments have been halved since Brexit. Amid rising costs and inflation, this is another squeeze on finances for farming businesses, many of which fear they will have to shut down.The environment schemes, which are guaranteed payments to farmers as opposed to the ad hoc grants or training programmes also included in the budget, have yielded a relatively small spend for farms. The total spend by the government on environment farming schemes was \u00a3515m in 2021/22 and \u00a3688m in 2022/23.Steve Reed, the shadow environment secretary, said Labour would free up the missing funding for farmers and make it easier to receive money from environment schemes. Reed said: \u201cThe Conservatives have broken yet another promise to our farmers. This money should be in the pockets of our farmers, who have instead been abandoned by this government.\u201cLabour will cut through the Tory bureaucracy that has blocked farmers from receiving funding for work that includes protecting nature and wildlife habitats on their land. But we will go further. Labour will tear down export barriers for farmers by seeking a veterinary agreement with the EU, ensure more food bought by the public sector is locally produced, and generate clean energy here in the UK to cut farmers\u2019 energy bills. Labour is determined to give farmers their future back.\u201dThe environment secretary, Steve Barclay, is to address farmers on Thursday at the Oxford Farming Conference, to make the government\u2019s pre-general election pitch to the agriculture industry. He is not expected to lay out a detailed plan to spend the money missing from the budget.Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union, said the underspend was unacceptable.She added: \u201cFarmers were promised a seamless transition to [the post-Brexit payment scheme] Elms. In a general election year it is unacceptable that the schemes are still in development, there are huge concerns at to whether the sustainable farming incentive payments can be delivered \u2013 despite the NFU and others asking for piloting of delivery, this hasn\u2019t happened. With 50% of basic payment scheme payments cut, farmers in England have no idea where that money is and what it has been spent on.\u201dA Defra spokesperson said: \u201cThese claims are categorically untrue. As we have repeatedly made clear, we are on track to meet our commitment to maintaining our annual farming budget for England at \u00a32.4bn per year, with a higher spend planned in the final year of this parliament to ensure we achieve this. We have invested a significant amount of money in the farming sector including through Elms and we are seeing strong demand for the improved sustainable farming incentive offer.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, fur traders nearly drove the species to extinction for their warm pelts, killing 99% of the global population, Jeffers said.Today the populations face risks from oil spills, low genetic diversity and disease. Reintroduction is not unprecedented \u2013 such efforts have helped re-establish populations along other parts of the coast.\u201cSea otters are important to healthy oceans, healthy coastlines.

Queensland and South Australia are expected to have prices of $117.20 and $112.93 per megawatt hour, the ASX said.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nMookhey and the finance minister, Courtney Houssos, will on Thursday write to coalmining companies, power station operators, unions and trading partners seeking their feedback.The government has promised to engage with the state\u2019s mining industry. Houssos says Labor wants to ensure \u201congoing stability\u201d in the sector while providing power price relief for families and households.\u201cWe are committed to a clean energy future, but we understand the important role coal plays today in our energy mix and for our state\u2019s economy,\u201d she said.The government will be hoping to avoid a repeat of earlier this year, when the NSW mining sector railed against the former Liberal energy minister Matt Kean.In January Kean announced thermal coalminers would have to set aside as much as 10% of their output for local power stations under an expansion of the state\u2019s domestic reservation arrangements.Kean said the policy \u2013 which is set to expire next year \u2013 would \u201ceven the playing field\u201d for those coal producers which were following the emergency cap on wholesale prices.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are walking through a fairytale landscape: a gruffalo hiding behind every tree trunk, under every bridge a troll. The air is so still, yet so thrumming with life, it\u2019s hard to shake the feeling that it is listening to us more than we are to it.A jay\u2019s sudden alarm call rattles out like a struck washboard, and is just as quickly smothered by soft, wet air. Every pine needle is stitched to the next with spider\u2019s silk and the whole forest is aglitter with diamante necklaces, each with a resident brown\u2011and\u2011gold flecked spider dead centre like a tiger\u2019s eye pendant.One day, I might walk the whole 210-mile length of the River Severn, or Afon Hafren to give it its Welsh name, but on this drizzly, misty day I\u2019m happy that we\u2019re only four or five miles from the source. The mist muffles and befuddles, making dragons out of rocks, stag heads out of dead wood, ogres from boulders. When you can\u2019t believe your eyes, your ears step up a notch.

The soundscape splits in two. Below us, the regular splash and gurgle; but coming from the forested slope opposite is a soft, steady roar. Not thunder, not a plane: it\u2019s the water reverberating around the hollow it has carved at the bend, and listening to its own echo coming back through the trees. I click my hearing aid on, and get the sound of a million crisp packets rustling next to my ear. I switch it off. Turn to the right, the sounds are clear and quite distinct: the upper register roaring, the lower all tinkle and glug. Turn left, and I can barely hear the river at all. I stand there swivelling around like a loon: right roar, left shhh. It\u2019s amazing.As we walk upstream, the cloud thickens and the river quietens until, at one point, it\u2019s as though the sound has been simply turned off. At the source we stand, in silence and mist. No bright or bubbling spring, this, just a soggy peat bog giving quiet rise to a river, and sending it on its way.

        "text": "Researchers have uncovered a new genus of butterfly, with distinctive orange wings and dark eyespots. It is a striking appearance that has led the international team to label the genus Saurona, after Sauron, the evil lord of Mordor whose all-seeing fiery eye brought terror to Middle-earth and the Shires in The Lord of the Rings.It is an intriguing monicker. As JRR Tolkien describes it: \u201cThe Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself glazed, yellow as a cat\u2019s, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing.\u201dAnd the two species that form the new genus \u2013 Saurona triangula and Saurona aurigera \u2013 are certainly distinctive with their eyelike markings of vivid orange and jet black, although they are unlikely to invoke quite as much terror as Mordor\u2019s cruel ruler. They are relatively small even by butterfly standards. Nevertheless, their discovery and naming is important, say scientists.The Eye of Sauron from the 2001 film The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. Photograph: New Line Cinema/Allstar\u201cButterflies are under enormous pressure from habitat loss, and we desperately need to identify and study new species before time runs out for them,\u201d said Blanca Huertas of the Natural History Museum in London. \u201cBy giving them unusual names we can bring attention to what is happening to butterflies, which are in real trouble across the world today.\u201dIn the UK, three-quarters of all butterfly species are now believed to be in decline, while across the globe they are similarly threatened thanks to widespread habitat destruction, pesticides and accelerating climate change.Huertas is a member of an international group of researchers that has spent more than 10 years tracking down new butterfly species. Other scientists involved in the project are based at Harvard University and the Florida Museum of Natural History.This global project has taken more than a decade to complete and has assessed more than 400 species of butterflies using advanced DNA analysis and other techniques. These have allowed scientists to achieve a new understanding of butterflies, in particular of the sub-tribe known as Euptychiina.At present, only two species of butterfly of the genus Saurona have been discovered. However, it is thought that many more undiscovered species exist in the wild.\u201cEssentially, naming them after key fictional characters helps to pique people\u2019s interest in them, and that is important for their conservation,\u201d added Huertas.Being labelled after Sauron is a first for butterflies but not for other members of the animal kingdom. A dung beetle, a frog and a dinosaur have all been named after the ruler of Mordor. In addition, several dozen other creatures have been given tags that recall various Tolkien characters. These include Macrostyphlus gandalf, a species of weevil; Gollum attenuatus, a bottom-dwelling shark; and the Hairy-footed Moss Forest Blossom Bat of New Guinea, also known by its official name Syconycteris hobbit.Indeed, using Tolkien characters in scientific labels is now a common practice in science. For example, the Eye of Sauron has been used as a nickname for several astronomical objects, including distant galaxies and also the star system HR 4796A, and has even been employed to label an ancient undersea volcano discovered near Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean.",

        "text": "National Highways has unveiled a new design for motorway gantries that it hopes will prove harder for protesters to mount and use to cause disruption.The renovated structures, which are expected to become the standard design in England from 2025, will have their maintenance steps hidden inside their pillars and will be more difficult to gain access to without authorisation.The agency said this would make them \u201cmore resilient to trespassers\u201d, but it stressed that \u201csecurity issues did not form part of the original specification\u201d.Just Stop Oil activists scaled gantries above the M25 in November last year. Several stretches of the road were closed and arrests were made as members of the organisation protested against the climate emergency. One man, Jan Goodey, was handed a six-month sentence.A spokesperson for the group said: \u201cJust Stop Oil have always said the disruption will end immediately when the government agrees to end new oil and gas. Until then we look forward to the challenges the new gantry designs provide.\u201dNational Highways launched a competition to replace the gantry designs last December, a month after the M25 protests.The competition, run in conjunction with the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), was launched as part of a wider plan to \u201cbeautify\u201d the design of the country\u2019s busiest roads. Design guidance published by National Highways last July included recommendations such as \u201cminimising clutter\u201d, providing \u201cclues\u201d about how to drive, being sensitive to the local landscape and improving environmental sustainability. Entries were not expected to alter the technology that sits behind gantries.National Highways said: \u201cAlthough security issues did not form part of the original specification, the new design will be more resilient to trespassers due to entry being concealed within the pillars, making it more difficult to access without authorisation.\u201dThe successful concept was produced by the London-based architecture company Useful Studio and chosen for its \u201csimplicity and elegance\u201d.National Highways\u2019 executive director for operations, Duncan Smith, said: \u201cThis is a great opportunity for us to develop a more streamlined, elegant and consistent visual appearance for roadside gantries to enhance drivers\u2019 experience when driving on England\u2019s motorways and major A-roads.\u201cExisting designs tend to emphasise function over form. Our challenge is to create innovative structures that can accommodate the required signage and equipment that are more sympathetic to the environment.\u201dThe new gantries will have a lower carbon footprint than the current designs as they will use less steel.Jonathan McDowell, an RIBA architect adviser, said: \u201cIt is very encouraging that National Highways is actively engaging the design community in helping to improve the design of these ubiquitous but cumbersome parts of the motorway experience. We enjoyed seeing a wide range of interesting ideas, including those which challenged National Highways\u2019 current practices.\u201dDuring last November\u2019s protests, Just Stop Oil banners were draped from the overhead road structures. National Highways said at the time that the structures need \u201ca degree of accessibility\u201d for maintenance crews.",

        "text": "Marginal improvements to agricultural soils around the world would store enough carbon to keep the world within 1.5C of global heating, new research suggests.Farming techniques that improve long-term fertility and yields can also help to store more carbon in soils but are often ignored in favour of intensive techniques using large amounts of artificial fertiliser, much of it wasted, that can increase greenhouse gas emissions.Using better farming techniques to store 1% more carbon in about half of the world\u2019s agricultural soils would be enough to absorb about 31 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide a year, according to new data. That amount is not far off the 32 gigatonnes gap between current planned emissions reduction globally per year and the amount of carbon that must be cut by 2030 to stay within 1.5C.The estimates were carried out by Jacqueline McGlade, the former chief scientist at the UN environment programme and former executive director of the European Environment Agency. She found that storing more carbon in the top 30cm of agricultural soils would be feasible in many regions where soils are currently degraded.McGlade now leads a commercial organisation that sells soil data to farmers. Downforce Technologies uses publicly available global data, satellite images and lidar to assess in detail how much carbon is stored in soils, which can now be done down to the level of individual fields.\u201cOutside the farming sector, people do not understand how important soils are to the climate,\u201d said McGlade. \u201cChanging farming could make soils carbon negative, making them absorb carbon, and reducing the cost of farming.\u201dShe said farmers could face a short-term cost while they changed their methods, away from the overuse of artificial fertiliser, but after a transition period of two to three years their yields would improve and their soils would be much healthier.She estimated it would cost about $1m (\u00a3790,000) to restore 40,000 hectares (99,000 acres) of what is currently badly degraded farmland in Kenya, an area that is home to about 300,000 people.Downforce data could also allow farmers to sell carbon credits based on how much additional carbon dioxide their fields are absorbing. Soil has long been known to be one of Earth\u2019s biggest stores of carbon, but until now it has not been possible to examine in detail how much carbon soils in particular areas are locking up and how much they are emitting. About 40% of the world\u2019s farmland is now degraded, according to UN estimates.Carbon dioxide removal, the name given to a suite of technologies and techniques that increase the uptake of carbon dioxide from the air and sequester the carbon in some form, is an increasing area of interest, as the world slips closer to the critical threshold of 1.5C of global heating above pre-industrial levels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Livestock farmers could improve their soils by growing more native grasses.Hedgerows also help to sequester carbon in the soil, because they have large underground networks of mycorrhizal fungi and microbes that can extend metres into the field. Farmers have spent decades removing hedgerows to make intensive farming easier, but restoring them, and maintaining existing hedgerows, would improve biodiversity, reduce the erosion of topsoil, and help to stop harmful agricultural runoff, which is a key polluter of rivers.",

It says the homes are too small, the concrete panel buildings are dilapidated and most residents want new homes.But a rival plan backed by some residents to retrofit the homes proposes adding insulation, reconfiguring internal walls and adding balconies to produce a climate impact estimated at six times smaller.The masterplan for the new estate has been drawn up by the architects Allford Hall Monaghan Morris, the firm of Simon Allford, the president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. The rival scheme has been devised by Alice Brown, who was funded to do so by the RIBA.View from Warden RoadThe row comes as the Green party accused the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, of funding the demolition of about 1,000 homes in the capital \u2013 including at Kentish Town \u2013 on the basis they are \u201cobsolete\u201d when they are not. There is growing pressure on architects and developers to reuse concrete structures, rather than rebuild, to avoid greater climate impact.Khan had sought to avoid using City Hall cash to fund projects where homes are demolished only to be replaced. But if existing homes are defined as \u201cobsolete\u201d projects can still claim grants. Si\u00e2n Berry, the leader of the Greens in the London assembly, said this had given councils and housing associations too much leeway to write off homes that appeared to be usable in at least 10 boroughs.\u201cIt is a scandal that so many homes are being condemned to the wrecking ball unfairly by councils and housing associations when most of the problems residents are facing with cold and damp homes are down to simple neglect and lack of maintenance,\u201d she said.View from Rhyl StreetBrown believes her retrofit plan would result in 16,000 tonnes of embodied carbon dioxide, compared with about 100,000 tonnes under the larger demolition and rebuild.A spokesperson for Khan said: \u201cLondon has some of the country\u2019s oldest housing stock and not every home can be refurbished. In some cases, it is more sustainable to carefully dismantle a building, maximising reuse of building materials, as mandated by the London plan, and replacing it with one that\u2019s more energy-efficient, with lower operational carbon emissions.\u201dCamden council last summer agreed a plan to replace the 316-home West Kentish Town estate with 885 replacements \u2013 up to 60% of which will be for private sale. The cabinet heard from residents about poor conditions, no lifts, balconies, damp and leaks. In 2020, 93% of residents voted in favour of redevelopment.The homes were built in 1964 on the site of century-old terraces built for workers constructing the railways. Commentators said it was one of the country\u2019s first \u201cfully considered \u2018industrialised\u2019 environments\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The regulator has downgraded its expectations amid rising costs for components, engineering and construction.In contrast to the uplift in small-scale renewables, Parker said it was a quiet first half of the year for new large-scale renewable energy investment commitments.\u201cWe\u2019ve downgraded our expectations and now expect 2023 investment may not reach three gigawatts,\u201d Parker said.It follows warnings from experts that the sector is not moving at a fast enough pace to meet an 82% renewable energy target by 2030.The Australian Energy Market Operator warned in June that the country\u2019s transition away from fossil fuels was moving too slowly with not enough investment in wind and solar farms.The regulator said finding ways to streamline grid connection and fast-track new transmission would be critical.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Uptake for the project, a digital deposit return scheme (DDRS) in which citizens get 10p for every container they recycle, has been good with 1,300 of the 4,300 households eligible signing up and 25,000 containers set to be processed.The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, who visited on Wednesday, said: \u201cWe\u2019re committed to introducing a deposit return scheme in Wales and it\u2019s important we explore the different ways a scheme could be delivered.\u201cWales is the third best country in the world for recycling but we need to go further if we are to reach net zero and tackle littering.

They can then recycle the containers in their normal Powys county council kerbside collection bin or at community points.Participants can also take containers to automated machines at a supermarket or leisure centre or hand them over to assistants at some stores.The drinks containers with the 10p sticker will not cost more than normal as the reward is being funded by the sponsors, which include retailers in Brecon, packaging companies and some drinks brands as well as the government.Participant can scan stickers on the containers using their phone and earn 10p a time. Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/Athena PicturesNellie Salter, the trial supervisor, said they had been pleased by how many people had taken part and were testing things such as how people preferred to return containers (it turned out to be via their kerbside bins) and if people tried to defraud the system.Challenges had included the sometimes ropey mobile phone coverage, and there was an unexpected spike when, during the town\u2019s jazz festival, youngsters realised there was cash to be made.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The fee was intended to cover the cost of producing the low-carbon gas instead of polluting fossil fuels.But the energy security secretary has now said he does not support a \u201clevy directly on households\u201d, signalling a possible U-turn as households struggle with high inflation and this week\u2019s shock interest rate rise. Instead, he said, it should be paid for \u201cfurther up the chain\u201d.\u201cWhat we need to do is make sure that, A, we can get our hydrogen industry up and running. Really, really important, massive export opportunities, great way to store energy, great way to power heavy industry and what have you,\u201d he told the Daily Telegraph.\u201cAnd, B, I don\u2019t want to see people\u2019s household bills unnecessarily bashed by this.\u201dThe thinktank Onward has estimated the levy would increase energy bills by about \u00a3118 a year for the average dual fuel household.Shapps said he supported other ways of moving towards cleaner energy and net zero, which he said could include passing the costs on to the energy industry or general taxation.The law\u2019s wording would ensure the cost would not be applied directly to bills, he said.\u201cThe fuss was because there was a clause in the energy bill which would take powers to [impose a hydrogen levy], though not actually legislate,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to make sure that, whatever that clause is, it makes it clear that\u2019s not a levy directly on households. The way that\u2019s funded will have to be further up the chain.\u201dDiscussions between his department, No 10 and the Treasury aim to reach a conclusion on the new approach, according to the Telegraph, with an alternative funding scheme hoped to be agreed before the parliamentary recess next month.The hydrogen levy plans prompted a backlash from within his own party and opposition MPs, who fear further bill increases amid the war in Ukraine and the cost of living crisis.Labour claimed the move was an attempt to avoid a Tory backbench rebellion.Alan Whitehead, a shadow energy minister, said: \u201cThis is yet another humiliating U-turn for Rishi Sunak, showing that his government is completely out of touch with reality.\u201cDuring a cost of living crisis, millions of families are already struggling to make ends meet and yet the government have been doggedly pursuing these regressive levies for months, only to finally back down over fears of a rebellion from their own backbenches.\u201dHe said Labour would instead overhaul Britain\u2019s \u201cbroken\u201d energy system and \u201cdeliver the green transition we so desperately need, energy security and bills that are affordable\u201d.",

Airlines will need to start thinking about how they will manage the increased turbulence, as it costs the industry $150-500m annually in the USA alone.\u201dPrevious studies have suggested that a climate that is heating up could increase turbulence but Prof Paul Williams, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading and co-author of the research, said it was the first evidence it was already happening.\u201cWe should be investing in improved turbulence forecasting and detection systems, to prevent the rougher air from translating into bumpier flights in the coming decades,\u201d he said.The rapidly changing climate is already known to be affecting air travel.

They have provided guidance on everything from hydropower dam construction in Nepal to farm diversification in Ethiopia.Alongside private consultancies, the UK\u2019s climate finance is also spent via large international bodies such as the World Bank, UN agencies, development banks and NGOs.Much of the money administered by these groups goes directly to projects, although all of them take cuts along the way to pay for staff and other expenses. Nevertheless, experts say the large scale involvement of private consultancies can lead to the money being used less effectively, adding there is growing opposition to climate aid being funnelled through these companies rather than groups with local contacts and expertise.Clare Shakya, a climate finance expert at the International Institute for Environment and Development, said the least developed countries and small-island states in particular had pushed for funding for more long-term climate action rather than the project-based activities consultancies often supported.She said: \u201cThe poorest and most climate-impacted countries are clear that business as usual in climate finance is not working for them. Short-term projects driven by external experts are failing to provide the support they need to transform to low-carbon development and greater climate resilience.\u201dThe UK government has scaled up its spending on consultants and made it easier for public sector bodies to hire them in recent years. At the same time, their role in public life has been under growing scrutiny. Academics, politicians and officials have criticised the outsourcing of responsibilities to expensive private contractors.Responding to these concerns during her speech at the Labour party conference this week, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, vowed to slash consultancy spending by half if her party won the next election.Carbon Brief\u2019s analysis looked at more than 25,000 transactions listed on the government\u2019s development tracker website from projects that contribute to the UK\u2019s International Climate Finance.Both KPMG and PwC declined to comment on Carbon Brief\u2019s findings or the criticism of consultancies running climate-finance projects. They also declined to share information on how much money they retained as fees for their services on these projects.The UK government declined to comment on its use of consultancies to administer climate-finance projects.A spokesperson for Adam Smith International said it did not recognise the figures in the Carbon Brief analysis. They added the consultancy \u201cardently ensures optimal value for money in [its] projects\u201d, with \u201ccompetitively and responsibly structured\u201d fees and \u201ctransparency in [its] financial dealings, including profitability and expenditure\u201d.

Cold conditions may also encourage less frequent garden visitors to turn up at bird feeders, including redpolls and bramblings.A YouGov poll commissioned by the RSPB found that 88% of UK adults said spending time outdoors enjoying the natural world was important to them, with 53% stating it was very important, while 91% agreed that seeing birds and hearing birdsong had a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing.Spending time in woodlands, wetlands and other natural spaces has been shown by various studies to improve mental health and wellbeing.Dr Amir Khan, the president of the RSPB, said: \u201cWorking as a GP, I know just how important accessing green spaces is for our physical and mental wellbeing. Watching the blue tits and bullfinches enjoying the feeders in my garden is a constant source of comfort for me, and being on the frontline of the NHS I am very aware that comfort is something we all need now more than ever.\u201dOver four decades, Big Garden Birdwatch has alerted scientists to rises and falls in bird species. Last year\u2019s sightings data pointed to a revival for the disease-hit greenfinch, while over the decades the survey also first noted the precipitous decline in song thrushes, which are down 81% compared with the first Big Garden Birdwatch in 1979. It was 20th in the rankings last year, seen in just 8% of gardens.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Areas of Spain and Portugal have recorded daily maximum temperatures in the high 30s celsius for more than a week, exceeding 40C in parts of southern Spain on Sunday. Italy, France, Germany and the Benelux region also reached the low- to mid-30s celsius in places at the weekend.The heat is caused by a large area of high pressure that is stagnating over Europe and preventing the usual pattern of low pressure systems moving eastwards into Europe from the Atlantic. This is known as a blocking high and results in very dry and stable conditions, as the fronts associated with more dynamic weather patterns are forced away by the high pressure.This phenomenon has triggered a heat dome, in which warm air is trapped under the blocking high. The pressure acts like a lid, forcing rising warm air to sink, compressing it slightly and raising its temperature as a result. The heating effect is also exacerbated by the dry conditions, as drier air is able to heat quicker than humid air.The heat dome is likely to expand as it strengthens in the coming days, possibly spreading as far north-east as central Europe and bringing highs of more than 30C to parts of the continent each day. Spain will be particularly badly affected and is likely to hit the low- to mid-40s celsius daily, particularly across southern regions.Canada has also been experiencing unusually high temperatures in recent days, with a new peak recorded by a weather station in Fort Good Hope in the Northwest Territories on Saturday. The station, just outside the Arctic Circle at about 66\u00b0N, recorded 36.7C (98.1F), a record for that far north in Canada. With similarly high temperatures forecast this week for parts of the Northwest Territories, further records could be broken.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In fact, the sequel alternately treads water and splashes around frantically in search of an identity. Never settling on whether he wants his film to be Alien, Jaws, Jurassic Park or Sharknado, Wheatley serves up a bouillabaisse of all four.Battling a 75ft-long megalodon with an 8ft dorsal fin and five rows of teeth is another sort of formidable, remorseless beast: Jason Statham, who returns as shark-hunter and ocean-defender Jonas Taylor but still hasn\u2019t decided whether to play the role with a cockney accent or an American one. While he\u2019s mulling that over, he commandeers a submersible on a research trip 25,000ft below, only to find the mission gatecrashed by megs and other assorted sea monsters. It\u2019s the multiplicity of threats that scuppers any possible scares: everything from a giant squid and velociraptor-like land-dwelling lizards to a double-crossing entrepreneur and a gang of rogue miners leave the meg playing second fiddle in its own film. Matters have come to a pretty pass when audience and characters alike see an exploding head as little more than a minor setback.Intermittent pleasures include a knowing reference to Jaws 2 and a Little Shop of Horrors-style shot gazing out from inside an open mouth, as well as plenty of \u201cHell no!\u201d interjections from the endearing Page Kennedy as resident tech guy, DJ. And the film keeps Statham busy, whether he is taking to jet-skis for an impromptu midsea jousting tournament or scrambling along a pier as it\u2019s being masticated. His deathless way with a line reading can still raise a smile. \u201cGreat \u2013 more megs,\u201d is no one\u2019s idea of snappy dialogue but his unimpressed cadence lifts it into the realm of the droll.It\u2019s just a shame the film makes him spend so much time playing dad to a teenage sort-of stepdaughter, Meiying (Sophia Cai). Along with her uncle, Jiuming (Wu Jing), who thinks he can tame a megalodon, they end the film as a sitcom trio, suggesting a potential new direction for the third instalment.

The local Tory MP Johnny Mercersaid the decision to fell the trees was a factor in the loss. \u201cThe way the Conservative council did it, particularly at night \u2013 I obviously would have done it differently,\u201d he said.Now, the Labour-controlled council hopes to salvage the area. The new scheme will include a \u201cplay village\u201d for children made of the wood from the felled trees. There will be water fountains for young people to play in during the summer, as well as play apparatus.The council has consulted biodiversity specialists and chosen 16 species to plant, including silver birch, field maple, Turkish hazel and Judas trees. The area will also be used to help assuage pollution from the city\u2019s rainwater, will include a new surface water drainage system powered by solar panels and will recycle the water to maintain the plants and trees.Evans said: \u201cThe trees will be about eight metres high and they\u2019ll have a big girth around the trunk of up to 35cm, so they\u2019re not little spindly things that you sometimes see planned. These are going to be ready to go.\u201dBecause of the technical aspects of the scheme including lighting, CCTV and the drainage system, it will take about 70 weeks to complete, but some parts including vegetation will be installed sooner, he said.Evans said hewas most excited about the play area: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be places where kids can climb, swing, run and jump and have fun and so it\u2019ll be a destination playground, something that people will come into the city centre for and and stay and it\u2019ll be great for families.

Another Conservative prime minister, Theresa May, fired the starting gun on the race to net zero by 2050, enshrining the target in law.Overwhelmingly, Conservative voters back environmental action. A recent poll revealed that 73% back the net zero target \u2013 a higher proportion than among voters overall. YouGov\u2019s tracker poll consistently shows they rank the environment as the fourth most important issue facing the country. Nearly nine in 10 support solar power and offshore wind. Almost two-thirds think the ban on onshore wind in England must end.Some Conservatives sceptical of net zero and the severity of climate change view environmental action as an electoral liability. They\u2019re far from the majority, but they are an increasingly loud group. They\u2019ve drawn the wrong conclusions from the Uxbridge byelection, where the Conservatives won on an anti-ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), not anti-environment, ticket. They\u2019ve misunderstood cases of local backlash to poorly implemented low-traffic neighbourhoods. And they\u2019ve misread the public\u2019s rejection of Just Stop Oil\u2019s divisive stunts as a wider rebuff of climate action.Like all voters, Conservatives want fair, affordable environmental policies that maximise benefits while limiting direct costs. Two-thirds of Conservative voters support green policies that don\u2019t put the costs on ordinary people, while only 17% back them if they do result in costs. But polling shows the same is true of other policy priorities, such as health and crime. Politicians should ignore the extremes of disruptive protesters and climate sceptics who often dominate the media debate, and instead respond to people\u2019s concern about climate crisis in a way that minimises the costs.View image in fullscreen\u2018Almost two-thirds of Conservative voters think the ban on onshore wind in England must end.\u2019 Photograph: Nathan Stirk/Getty ImagesOn the right, sceptics can\u2019t undo the consensus around climate change so instead target specific policies where the public case still needs to be won, such as the rollout of electric cars and heat pumps. We\u2019ll need these two technologies to reach net zero, but the prices of both have yet to fall sufficiently. The answer isn\u2019t to ditch them, but to use the market to make them the cheapest and best options. Bold government targets, early support through funding for research and development, subsidies, tax breaks and light regulation can spur businesses to innovate and deploy clean technologies.Just as we\u2019ve scaled up renewables to provide more than 40% of our electricity today while making it the cheapest new energy source available, we need to do the same for electric vehicles and heat pumps. That\u2019s why the zero-emission vehicle mandate and government grants to support low-carbon heating are so important.Tory peer Zac Goldmith says he could be tempted to back Labour on climateRead moreSimilarly, there needs to be a coherent Conservative approach to transport. Cars are the only realistic transport option in most parts of the country, which is why the electric vehicle transition is the essential policy for transport decarbonisation. Our cities and towns shouldn\u2019t be anti-car, but also shouldn\u2019t prioritise them above everything else, given the limits on road space and the impacts on communities and the environment.Instead, we need to focus on expanding people\u2019s transport choices. Politicians should give people cheaper, greener travel methods, whether by improving public transport, carefully consulting on active travel infrastructure, or enabling innovative solutions like e-scooters. Most will choose them when provided, allowing those who need to drive to continue to do so.Conservative voters want to see environmental action. It needn\u2019t be at odds with personal freedom or at great cost to the individual. There will be trade-offs, which will initially require a more active state than some are comfortable with. But they pale in comparison to the costs and demand for government intervention unchecked climate change would bring.\nSam Hall is the director of the Conservative Environment Network\n",

        "text": "A warming world is transforming some major snowfalls over mountains into extreme rain, worsening both dangerous flooding like the type that devastated Pakistan last year as well as long-term water shortages, a new study has found.Using rain and snow measurements since 1950 and computer simulations for future climate, scientists calculated that for every degree Fahrenheit the world warms, extreme rainfall at higher elevation increases by 8.3% (15% for every degree Celsius), according to a study in Wednesday\u2019s journal Nature.Heavy rain in mountains causes a lot more problems than big snow, including flooding, landslides and erosion, scientists said. And the rain is not conveniently stored away like snowpack that can recharge reservoirs in spring and summer.\u201cIt is not just a far-off problem that is projected to occur in the future, but the data is actually telling us that it\u2019s already happening and we see that in the data over the past few decades,\u201d said lead author Mohammed Ombadi, a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory hydrologist and climate scientist.As the world has warmed to the brink of the 1.5C (2.7F) internationally agreed threshold to stem the worst effects of climate change, this study shows \u201cevery degree [Celsius] matters because it comes with an additional 15% increase\u201d in extreme rain over mountains, Ombadi said. That per-degree rainfall boost in the mountains is more than twice the increase the rest of the world gets from warming air holding more water.The study looked at only the heaviest rains each year over six decades in the northern hemisphere, finding that as altitude rose, so did the turbocharging of rain. The biggest increase in rains were noticed at about 10,000ft (3,000 meters). That includes much of the American west, where Ombadi said \u201cit\u2019s very pronounced\u201d, as well as parts of the Appalachian Mountains. Another big hotspot in Asia is the Himalayas, Tian Shan and Hindu Kush mountains, with the Alps also affected.About one in four people on Earth live in an area close enough to the mountains or downhill that extreme rain and flooding would hit them, Ombadi said.\u2018We have no dry land left\u2019: impact of Pakistan floods to be felt for yearsRead moreIt means more of the type of flooding off the mountains that killed more than 1,700 people in Pakistan and put one-third of the country underwater, Ombadi said. But he noted that they have not studied Pakistan\u2019s 2022 floods precisely so there may be some small differences.The study makes sense and \u201cthe implications are serious\u201d, said UCLA climate hydrologist Park Williams, who was not part of the research. Scientists expect more precipitation with warmer temperatures, but heavy snow\u2019s flooding impact is lessened because it takes time to melt and it is easier to monitor snowpack to see what\u2019s happening, he said.\u201cBut as the proportion of mountain precipitation falling as snow decreases, flood hazards may enhance especially rapidly,\u201d Williams said.In the American west it hits hard in two different ways, said study co-author Charuleka Varadharajan, a lab climate scientist and hydrologist.\u201cThis kind of extreme rainfall is going to make the floods worse. And then you\u2019ve got to figure out where is that water going?\u201d she said. \u201cWe have that situation right now in the Sierras with the Tulare Lake flooding and such a serious issue relating to that.\u201dSnow, floods and wildlife in peril: grueling winter leaves Yosemite scarredRead moreThe flooding also can hurt food production, Ombadi said. He pointed to California department of agriculture estimates of $89m in crop and livestock losses from this year\u2019s torrential rains.But in the long term, another problem is water supply. When the American west gets heavy snowfall in the winter, that snow melts slowly in spring and summer, filling reservoirs where it can be useful when it is needed later.\u201cIt\u2019s going to decrease your snow, your water supply in the future,\u201d Varadharajan said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have more short-term runoff leading to more floods and less snowpack that recharges the groundwater and the groundwater is ultimately what helps maintain stream flows.\u201d",

        "text": "The government has met less than half of its annual tree-planting target in England, MPs have found, putting net zero ambitions at risk.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) this year published what it called \u201cambitious\u201d nature targets, a requirement under the Environment Act, including the goal of planting 30,000 hectares of woodland by March 2025. A report by the environmental audit committee (EAC) of cross-party MPs has found that this target was unlikely to be met.While the public sector is responsible for only a quarter of UK woodland, the report found there was not enough direction from the government for the private sector, which faces \u201cunclear strategies and overly bureaucratic schemes\u201d.Tree planting is crucial for meeting carbon and biodiversity targets, as well as for sustainability in the building industry. The EAC report says UK-sourced timber will help meet the growing demand for low-carbon construction materials.It adds that a significant expansion of woodland cover is required to compensate for predicted shortfalls in the supply of domestically produced softwood timber and to deliver the UK\u2019s climate and environment goals. At present, the rate of planting is less than half of the government\u2019s target.The report recommends that the government focus on tree planting for its upcoming and delayed land use framework, which is supposed to be a blueprint for how land is allocated in the UK. The Defra minister Mark Spencer recently hinted that it would be watered down, saying it would not be a \u201ccommunist\u201d document telling landowners what to do with their estates.The wrong species being planted could also be a disaster for nature, the report says, recommending that native broadleaves offer ideal habitats for nature, while conifers supply softwood for timber use. The committee found this balance was unlikely to be struck, as the UK Forestry Standard is not routinely monitored and Forestry England lacks the resource to do this.The committee said it was \u201cdisappointed to observe that Forestry England is not currently on track to contribute fully to national tree-planting targets: to date it has only planted 303 hectares against its own target of 2,000 hectares between 2021-2026. Ministers should also commission work to identify opportunities for woodland creation on the wider government estate.\u201dThe EAC chair, Philip Dunne, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s target to plant 30,000 hectares of woodland in the UK by March 2025 is welcome, and by and large ministers appreciate the conflicting challenges and demands on woodland. But the committee is concerned that England is currently way off meeting its contribution to that UK-wide goal, and that the rate of planting must increase.\u201dThe Conservative MP added: \u201cAt the moment there are simply too many overlapping strategies that aim to cover tree-planting policies in the UK and in England, and there is little evidence of an overall vision for the timber sector. The numerous strategies are disjointed: what is required is an overarching, holistic strategy that sets a long-term vision for how different types of woodland will be used to deliver government\u2019s goals.\u201dA Defra spokesperson said: \u201cSince the start of this parliament, we have planted or supported the planting of over 10.8m trees. Increasing tree cover is at the heart of our pledge to meet net zero ambitions, which is why we are investing \u00a3650m during this parliament in transforming England\u2019s treescapes. We are also continuing to work on delivering our legal target to have 16.5% of England\u2019s total land area covered by trees by 2050.\u201cTree-planting rates are now at record levels, but we know there is much more to do and will continue to work with partners in both the private and public sector at pace to increase the nation\u2019s tree cover and boost the forestry sector \u2013 supporting domestic timber production, creating new jobs and improving biodiversity across the country.\u201d",

This accounts for about one in 15 of the total.Across the country, 856 were judged very poor, meaning they had \u201csevere defects resulting in complete performance failure\u201d, essentially rendering them useless.The remaining 3,348 were in poor condition, meaning they have defects that would \u201csignificantly reduce\u201d their performance.In the 10 English counties worst affected by Storm Babet, spanning from Suffolk to Northumberland, 646 were in a poor condition and 135 were judged to be very poor.The Environment Agency, which owns and maintains more than half of the flood defences in England, said inspections from the latest financial year showed an improvement, from one in 15 being in disrepair to one in 20.It added that contingency plans will be put in place if required when critical defences are found to be in poor condition.Paul Morozzo, Greenpeace UK\u2019s senior climate campaigner, said: \u201cOur crumbling flood defences are a symbolic and literal demonstration of the government\u2019s failure to tackle the climate crisis.\u201cStorm Babet was a sobering reminder that the climate crisis is on our doorstep and that the cost \u2013 both in terms of lives lost and damage caused \u2013 is huge.\u201cWithout bold action to cut emissions as fast as possible, extreme storms and flooding will become more common and more intense. And without the necessary investment and upgrades, our flood defences will continue to fail.\u201cBy rowing back on its climate commitments and failing to ensure we have infrastructure needed to mitigate its impacts, the government has all but given up on the communities it is supposed to protect. This is a shameful dereliction of duty and will cost votes in the coming election unless Sunak wakes up and has the guts to change direction.\u201dThe Environment Agency, which is a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, aimed last year to repair scores of its flood defences leaving only 30 in poor or very poor condition. In reality, 1,766 remained in that category.The environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, suggested last week that the Met Office and the Environment Agency had been caught off-guard by Storm Babet because the rain came in from the east.She also said it looked as if her department \u201cmay not be hitting\u201d its target of protecting 336,000 properties by 2027.The Met Office has said the 18 to 20 October period was the third-wettest independent three-day period in England and Wales since 1891. The Midlands provisionally recorded its wettest three-day period on record.Defra said it was investing \u00a35.2bn between 2021 and 2027 to protect properties from flooding and that more than 96,000 buildings were shielded from Storm Babet.An Environment Agency spokesperson said: \u201cWe maintain approximately 76,000 flood assets across England, 95% of which we would expect to function as designed during a flood, which is an increase on the previous year.\u201cWe prioritise maintenance where there is significant threat to lives and livelihoods, which was supported by a \u00a3200m investment between April 2022 and March 2023 to ensure our assets were winter ready.\u201d This article\u2019s headline was amended on 31 October 2023.

Deforestation reached a record high of 219,973 hectares (543,565 acres) in 2017, up 23% from the previous year.Then president Iv\u00e1n Duque used the environmental destruction caused by coca cultivation to justify stepping up military action against coca farmers. Prohibited from spraying coca crops with glyphosate after the chemical was banned in 2015 for health concerns, the Duque government sent in choppers and armed troops into the Amazon rainforest, sometimes into deadly confrontations with coca farmers.Yet while cattle ranches cleared more than 3m hectares (7.4m acres) of Amazon rainforest in 2018, coca\u2019s impact was negligible.Cattle roam the deforested Amazon in Guaviare, Colombia, in 2022. Photograph: Mauricio Due\u00f1as Casta\u00f1eda/EPAOnly 45,000 hectares (111,200 acres) were cleared for coca in 2018, the latest year available in the study.Using a deep learning algorithm to differentiate between land used for coca and cattle, Murillo and his colleagues were for the first time able to distinguish between the activities on a mass scale from 1985 to 2019.\u201cWe have always contested the government\u2019s argument that coca was driving deforestation but lacked the evidence,\u201d said Angelica Rojas, liaison officer for Guaviare state at the Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development, a Colombian environmental thinktank. \u201cNow we have real data with which we can oppose this mistake.\u201dThe figures show that previous governments have used the environment as a false justification to wage war on coca farmers, said Rojas, who was not involved in the study.\u201cThey didn\u2019t want to prevent deforestation, they just wanted to justify spending more money and resources on their real political goal: eliminating coca,\u201d she said.The study also adds to evidence that despite lives being sacrificed and billions of dollars being spent, Colombia\u2019s \u201cwar on drugs\u201d has failed to halt coca production \u2013 and in some cases it may have even made it worse.When farmers have their crops eradicated they simply establish new plots, often just a few kilometres deeper into the forest canopy, Murillo said. \u201cThe war on drugs started 40 years ago now, yet everyone knows where coca is: in the same place they have always been.\u201dAs the government has engaged in a game of whack-a-mole with coca farmers, the real driver of deforestation, cattle farming, has been allowed to swallow up vast swathes of land, the authors argue.Flaws in Colombian land regulation have incentivised the conversion of biodiverse tropical rainforests into barren pastures.To get their deeds recognised, landowners must demonstrate that 75% of their plots are productive, and it is far easier for farmers to use cows than crops, said Carlos Devia, a forest engineer at Bogot\u00e1\u2019s Javeriana University who was not involved in the study.\u201cRanching is the easiest way to show you\u2019re using land, as it\u2019s unregulated. You could have 100 hectares of land and just throw 10 cows in there, whereas for potatoes or corn only a hectare would require a year of great work,\u201d Devia said.Landless farmers often clear a few hectares of rainforest and sell them illegally to members of criminal organisations who then join up multiple small lots, transforming them into vast swathes of lifeless, arid pasture.Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who took office in August last year, is proposing a U-turn on Colombia\u2019s failed anti-narcotics strategy.Petro, a former member of the defunct M-19 rebel group, has turned the focus away from forced coca eradication, and is buying up millions of hectares of land to give to farmers.\u201cReducing drug use does not require wars, it needs us all to build a better society,\u201d Petro told the UN general assembly in September last year.",

Recent research estimated sperm concentration has plummeted by about 50% over the last 50 years, and Perry said the insecticides could represent a piece of that puzzle.About 15m pounds of organophosphates are spread on US cropland annually, and the chemical formula has been linked to cancer, while exposure during pregnancy is tied to neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD and autism. The insecticide is also commonly used on lawns or indoors.The Environmental Protection Agency announced this year it was accelerating new regulations for some types of organophosphates because they are much more toxic than previously thought. Carbamates are similarly utilized, and both are neurotoxins that work by damaging an enzyme that regulates an insect\u2019s nerve signals sent throughout its body.\u201cThese are manufactured to kill things and are biologically active by their very nature,\u201d Perry said, but that can have consequences for larger living organisms.The chemicals appear to interfere with the human endocrine system\u2019s hormone production, she said, which would \u201chave a direct impact on how much and how normally sperm is produced\u201d. The chemicals may also damage testes cells and alter neurotransmission in the brain related to reproductive purposes.Agricultural workers face the highest exposure, but about one-third of the studies\u2019 participants were exposed largely through food, or other environmental routes, Perry said. Though the strongest correlation was found among participants who face occupational exposure, that may only be because fewer studies looking at environmental exposure exist, she added.Public health advocates are increasingly pressuring the EPA to impose stricter regulations of the chemicals, or ban them outright. Perry said the best way individuals can protect themselves is to know which foods typically have high levels of pesticide residues on them.But, she added, it shouldn\u2019t be \u201cup to each individual person to solve this\u201d.\u201cThe recommendation we\u2019re making is to recognize that these insecticide exposure are a public health issue \u2026 and we really need to look toward policy solutions that recognize that a health threat exist,\u201d Perry said.",

They were canned by Eric Pickles in 2015 and we have had 13 years of delays. This has been kicked down the road and what is going on now is the result of that.\u201dHow could England\u2019s water system be fixed?Read moreHe spoke as the institute published a comprehensive report at Westminster, which calls for the next government to order an independent investigation into water companies, who stand accused of widespread pollution and profiteering, and the regulators, who have failed to robustly control the privatised industry.\u201cOver 30 years on from water privatisation, with widespread urbanisation and agricultural intensification, a fresh approach \u2013 including potential reform of water regulators \u2013 is needed,\u201d the report says.\u201cWith levels of trust in water companies impacted by repeated reports of pollution and profiteering, both public and water practitioners want more transparency and assurance that companies are acting in the interest of society and the environment.\u201dThe authors of the report interviewed professionals working in the water and environmental industries. Overwhelmingly, they expressed widespread dissatisfaction over water company ownership and operations. Just 6% of the experts questioned were supportive of a continuation of the current approach to ownership, corporate governance and regulation.The report calls for the Conservative government to finally implement rules to create sponge cities after a decade in which ministers have delayed and attempted to scrap the plans. Sponge cities are urban zones with multiple areas of greenery, trees, ponds, soakaways, pocket parks and permeable paving to allow water to drain away. They also include measures to store rainwater and runoff, such as widespread use of water butts.Increased runoff from rainfall overwhelms water company sewage systems, which have not been maintained and improved by water companies as a result of under-investment. The extra water increases the likelihood of raw sewage being discharged, while hard surfaces in towns and cities increase the risk of flooding.In its latest business plan, Thames Water says by 2015 London had seen the biggest decrease in plant cover in front gardens of anywhere in the UK, with five times as many front gardens with no plants compared with the preceding 10 years.This increased the burden on sewers and the risk of pollution, the company said.But the Conservative government has repeatedly failed to implement rules under schedule 3 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, which mandated developers to install sustainable drainage systems in new developments. Conservative ministers have argued the requirements will be too costly for developers.The Guardian revealed last year that at least 10% of donations received by the Conservative party since 2010 came from property developers, real estate tycoons and others connected with the construction industry.How much of your water bill is swallowed up by company debt? \u2013 interactiveRead morePublic outcry over sewage pollution, and revelations about water companies\u2019 abuse of storm overflows to dump raw sewage into rivers, which should only take place in exceptional circumstances, have forced the government to look again at schedule 3. But as yet it has not been made mandatory for developers.\u201cSponge cities are not a new concept and are being delivered internationally to manage demands for growth amidst water \u2013 typically flood and drought \u2013 crises,\u201d the report said.\u201cIn the UK we have our own water crises spanning these same challenges of either too much or too little water, as well as pollution.\u201cGreening our urban spaces is a win-win approach on all these fronts. We must flip the mindset that treats rainwater as a waste product to be got rid of in the urban environment, into one where it is a treasured resource.\u201dThe report, which polled 4,000 members of the public, found 71% of people in England believed water company profits should be restricted because of performance concerns.

How can someone come back from this?\u201dThe varroa mite is a sesame-seed sized parasite that has wreaked havoc on the New South Wales honeybee industry since it was first detected in surveillance hives in the Port of Newcastle in June last year.In the past month the pest has been detected in hives at Euroley, \u200b\u200bNericon, and Balranald in the Riverina; Euston in Sunraysia; Newcastle and Singleton in the Hunter; Tamworth in New England; Blackwall on the Central Coast; Vineyard in the Sydney basin; and Cuttabri in NSW\u2019s north-west.These hives had all been transported from areas around Kempsey, where they were fulfilling pollination contracts, before the infestation was discovered. All areas where the mite has been detected have been declared red zones.The detections at Balranald and Euston were close enough to the Victorian border that emergency zones were extended into that state last month. It is the first time an emergency zone has been declared outside NSW since the outbreak began.To date there have been no varroa mite detections in Victoria, the state\u2019s chief plant health officer, Dr Rosa Crnov, said.Banham\u2019s beekeeping shed is now located within a red zone. The emergency order, issued by the NSW government last week, means that bees are unable to be kept in any red zone \u2013 which now includes Kempsey \u2013 for the next three years.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nThe NSW and federal governments have announced an $18m reimbursement package for beekeepers affected by the outbreak, but Banham and other commercial keepers say that\u2019s not enough.\u201cThe compensation, we feel, is on the minimal end of the scale to what it actually costs to rebuild a hive,\u201d she says.\u201cIt\u2019s wiped our entire business out. We don\u2019t have anything to fall back on, and we now have no income and a mortgage to pay and two little kids, ongoing business expenses, and we have nothing left. It\u2019s all gone.\u201dMore than 28,000 hives have been destroyed since the mite was first detected 14 months ago. As of this month there have been 250 properties listed as having an infestation. Eradication zones \u2013 red zones \u2013 now cover more than 1,683,000 hectares, or 2% of NSW\u2019s landmass. All honeybees within red zones have to be euthanised, whether the varroa mite has been detected in their hive or not.Bees within emergency surveillance zones, marked in purple on a map updated daily by the NSW Department of Primary Industries, must not be moved unless they have an approved permit issued by the department.Benjamin Durie, a commercial beekeeper from the Humble Hive Collective in Maitland, lost his hives in the early stages of the varroa outbreak last year.\u201cYou get compensated for the hardware. You\u2019re compensated for the bees. But you then lose any potential revenue from those sites,\u201d he says.\u201cSo for me I lost a rose farm, I lost a vineyard and a brewery, where I would regularly run talks and classes.\u201cIt multiplies when you lose the platform.

Opponents say they simply lengthen and displace motor vehicle journeys.The new study, published in the journal Transport Findings, used mileage data logged as part of MOT tests from thousands of vehicles in Lambeth, south London. It showed an average decline in driving of 0.7km (0.4 miles) a day for every vehicle inside LTNs, two years after they were installed, compared with a rise of 0.6km for streets 200 metres or more outside their boundaries, for a net 1.3km (0.8 miles) reduction, or 6.4%.The authors of the study, led by Dr Anna Goodman, an epidemiologist from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the increase in average driving outside the LTNs appeared to be due to Covid and other external factors, rather than people skirting the LTNs.People living the closest to the LTNs, within 200 metres of their edges, who would be expected to be most affected by such changes to driving trips, recorded an increase in their average driving levels, but by less than those further away.The study, also involving academics from the University of Westminster and Imperial College London, linked the mileage data logged in annual MOT tests \u2013 mandatory for all cars or vans three years old or more \u2013 with information about residents\u2019 parking permits to estimate average distances driven each year per vehicle.This was initially calculated for 2018 to 2020, to take into account the position before the LTNs were installed, and then between 2021 and 2023. The data covered just over 8,500 cars and vans for the first period, and more than 10,000 for the second.Adding to the expectation that the net reduction in driving was caused by the LTNs is the fact that the data from 2018 to 2020 showed no difference in trends between the areas subsequently covered by the zones and those outside.Similarly, the decrease in mileage was seen in households with the same vehicle registered in 2020 and 2023, indicating the change was not caused by people who drive more frequently simply moving out but by a change in behaviour.The areas within and outside the LTNs had largely similar demographic and socioeconomic profiles, while the changes in driving were seen in more deprived and more affluent areas, the study found.The overall 1.3km-a-day reduction covers all journeys, including longer-distance ones, meaning the effect on reducing local car and van trips could be even greater.Goodman said: \u201cTo achieve an estimated 6% relative decrease in total annual driving is really impressive. Moreover, for shorter and more local trips it is plausible that the relative decrease in residents\u2019 driving is even greater than 6%.\u201cThis matters because, while reducing driving of any type is good news in terms of carbon emissions, reducing driving within cities brings large additional health benefits in terms of air pollution, noise and road safety.\u201d",

The aim of the SFI is to pay farmers to look after nature, soil and other public goods, rather than simply for farming and owning land.The 2023 scheme was supposed to roll out in August but is being delayed, and farmers are not expected to receive any payments until 2024. Because the rules regarding SFI payments have changed since last year, land managers are unsure whether to continue with the scheme from 2022, or to follow guidance laid out in proposals for the 2023 scheme.This is the latest blow to the post-Brexit scheme. Last year, only 224 farmers in England received payments under SFI. Just a tiny fraction of the payments went to farmers in 2022. While subsidies were cut by an average of 22% for farmers last year, the money paid out through SFI equated to only 0.44% of the total funding plan for farmers, leaving them asking where the money is going.This year the cuts are even more stark, with the government planning to slash payments by 36%. This, coupled with a difficult harvest caused by adverse weather conditions and rising interest rates, is causing a squeeze on farms.David Exwood, the vice-president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union, said: \u201cFarmers in England have had further basic payment scheme reductions. Milk prices are down and prices for red meat are also on the slide.\u201cIt has been the most expensive year we have ever had and a very difficult harvest. It will be a tough autumn for farmers.\u201dThe industry publication Farmers Weekly reported that the IT team managing the scheme had encountered technical problems, leading to further delays.Alice Groom, the head of sustainable land use policy at the conservation charity the RSPB, said: \u201cWith the proposed August rollout yet to begin we increasingly fear that Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] is at risk of failing on all fronts \u2013 leaving farmers confused and with no progress against pressing environmental targets.

It was agreed there would be follow-up discussions between staff, suggesting there is a live conversation about how the expansion of the ultra-low emissions zone (Ulez) will work in practice.Khan has sought to signal he is in listening mode and it is understood from those close to city hall that he is happy to look at any new ideas for ways to mitigate the impact on Londoners.However, the London mayor will not compromise on any moves that could reduce the effectiveness of the policy, which is designed to tackle air pollution and climate change.Khan last month widened the pool of people who can get financial support to replace polluting vehicles, ahead of Ulez being expanded from its current boundaries of the north and south circular to the whole of Greater London.City hall sources did not rule out further such moves, given the Tories managed to successfully turn this week\u2019s byelection in west London into a referendum on the Ulez extension.However, they were keen to stress that nine out of 10 cars in outer London are unaffected and will not have to pay the extra \u00a312.50 a day surcharge.Starmer nodded to Ulez having been an issue at the byelection on Thursday. The result meant the Conservatives escaped a triple trouncing as Labour won in Selby and Ainsty and the Liberal Democrats took Somerton and Frome.Starmer told delegates at Labour\u2019s policy forum: \u201cThat result in Uxbridge demonstrates there is never any reason to be complacent and never a reason to rest on our laurels.\u201dQuoting the party\u2019s candidate in Uxbridge, Danny Beales, he added: \u201cIt is a reminder, as Danny said, that in an election, policy matters.\u201cAnd we are doing something very wrong if policies put forward by the Labour party end up on each and every Tory leaflet. We\u2019ve got to face up to that and learn the lessons.\u201dThe future of the Ulez expansion faces greater uncertainty given it is subject to a judicial review, the outcome of which is expected to be known before the end of July.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Since new leader Chris Hipkins took the helm from Jacinda Ardern at the start of the year, he has angled policy relentlessly toward cost of living pressures, scrapping a wide array of reforms and legislative efforts in order to free up \u201cbandwidth\u201d and budgets to focus on economic concerns.Ruthless Chris Hipkins backpedals on climate action as New Zealand elections near | Henry CookeRead moreThose reforms have come with costs \u2013 most recently to an array of legislation and reform projects designed to counter the climate crisis. In the latest two swathes of announcements, policies dumped or delayed included a biofuel mandate, a \u201ccash for clunkers\u201d scheme that allowed people to trade in old, high-emissions vehicles for cleaner alternatives, the expansion of many regional public transport networks, and light rail plans for Auckland. Simultaneously, the government has extended tax cuts on petrol \u2013 subsidising fossil fuel consumption to keep petrol prices low. For Labour\u2019s coalition partners, the Greens, the re-orientation is a source of strain and frustration, as the party struggles to achieve the level of climate action it desires as a coalition partner.\u201cFive years on, we still don\u2019t have an agricultural emissions pricing proposal worthy of the paper it\u2019s written on \u2013 that even some of the industry players who came up with it are threatening to walk away from,\u201d Shaw says. \u201cThat does my head in.\u201dWhile none of the cut policies alone were expected to make an enormous dent in New Zealand\u2019s emissions profile \u2013 Hipkins has called them \u201ca very, very small contribution to our overall emissions reduction targets\u201d \u2013 their collective scrapping contributed a picture of a government closing down some of its low emissions pathways to focus its energies on paving a highway to re-election. \u201cThere have been a number of moves, like the extension of the fossil fuel subsidy, and those other moves earlier this week, that do add up to a situation where we don\u2019t have very many easy options left,\u201d Shaw says, speaking to the Guardian after his speech on Sunday. \u201cWe are going to have to bring something new to the table that brings down emissions by more than the sum total of the policies that were cut.\u201dSo far, he says, he has had no substantive discussions with the government about what those replacement policies would be.\u201cIt is a new administration, essentially,\u201d he says, comparing Hipkins\u2019 government with Ardern\u2019s, but says the relationship is still strong.New Zealand minister decries climate crisis \u2018lost decades\u2019 in wake of Cyclone GabrielleRead more\u201cThere\u2019s a lot that we agree on.

That\u2019s not unusual.\u201dWith the election less than seven months away, the Green party is tasked with a difficult juggling act: persuading voters that it can make substantive, transformative changes in government, while harnessing and channelling growing frustration at New Zealand\u2019s glacial climate progress. After years of cheerleading government reforms, Shaw has swung more firmly toward the latter.\u201cWe have done a pretty good job of the governments that we\u2019ve been given. But with only two ministers, both outside cabinet, we don\u2019t always get what we want.\u201dGoing into the October election, Shaw has promised that the Greens \u201cwill not accept anything less than the strongest possible climate action\u201d \u2013 but what that non-acceptance would look like in practice is less clear. In the coming election, Labour will require the Green party\u2019s support to form a government. While this should place the party in a strong position to bargain for policy gains, the Greens have effectively ruled out working with the opposition. \u201cIf they want to form a government with us after the election, then what we\u2019re proposing will be very strong action on climate change.\u201dIf Labour enters coalition negotiations with a milquetoast set of climate policies, says co-leader Marama Davidson, \u201cthey can\u2019t take our support for granted\u201d.",

Right now, it would be effectively impossible to get to the Pacific islands without burning kerosene.Aviation connects families across the region and allows for essential travel, including for health and education. Flights also form the backbone of the growing and vital tourism industry. Tourism is now the biggest economic sector in the Pacific and it can bring many development benefits.As highly vulnerable island states, the goal of ridding the region of fossil fuels is an important one. The need to urgently transition away from fossil fuels is now also firmly embedded in the global climate framework through this week\u2019s agreement made at Cop28 in Dubai. In March, Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Tonga, Fiji, Niue, and Solomon Islands \u2013 negotiated the \u201cPort Vila Call for a Just Transition to a Fossil Fuel Free Pacific\u201d. The topic was back on the agenda at the Pacific Island Forum in the Cook Islands in November. But the realities \u2013 and the critical role of tourism in the region \u2013 make this task more complex.\u2018First line of defence\u2019: mangroves \u2013 and mitigation - lost in Fiji\u2019s tourism developmentRead moreBefore the Covid-19 pandemic, there were 1.8 million international arrivals by air and cruise ship to Pacific Island countries. Energy use and emissions associated with international flights and shipping are not formally accounted for, but they are likely to be huge. A great first step would be to actually measure them, and document the size of the challenge.The border closures during the pandemic created space for critical voices regarding how much, and what types of tourism would be suitable to the island context, its unique cultures and sensitive ecologies. Fiji is seeking to diversify from the mass-tourism model that involves international hotel chains to a more homegrown model of small-scale eco and cultural tourism experiences. Other countries have found their existing, smaller operator tourism base under pressure from greater arrivals \u2013 seen in Vanuatu with the flow of large cruise ships. The Cook Islands are attempting to follow a regenerative model, where tourism leaves net benefits for the islands.There are some signs that the tourism industry that serves the Pacific can become more sustainable. For very short trips, for example travel from Rarotonga to Aitutaki (roughly 260km), or perhaps Samoa to Tokelau (about 550km), electric aircraft will become an option. Local airlines could offer services of perhaps even up to 1,000km. A completely different, regional network might even be superior to what is on offer now. This, of course, will only work if there is enough renewable electricity available; air travel remains incredibly energy intensive.That highlights the most urgent task \u2013 to scale up renewable electricity generation in the islands. All Pacific Island countries have a long way to become self-sufficient on renewable energy. Even Fiji, the country with the highest share of renewable energy, only reaches a level of 30% of total energy. At the same time, it would be beneficial to engage proactively with the possibilities and partners required to transition the regional aviation network. For example, there might be an opportunity where start-up companies could test new technologies in the Islands, perhaps on short routes. This is happening in Alaska \u2013 where ZeroAvia and Alaska Airlines have teamed up to deliver a hydrogen-electric flight in 2024 to connect Anchorage and Kenai.Short hops and economy class: five expert tips on how to reduce your emissions on holidayRead moreFinally, discussions on how to increase tourism value without large volumes of visitors should be given more oxygen. Research to identify what types of tourists leave more benefit behind than others could inform nuanced marketing strategies. Benefits could come in the form of financial return, but they might also be measured as the contribution to conservation or the community, or indeed a lower-than-average carbon footprint.Clearing the Pacific Islands of fossil fuels is an admirable goal \u2013 and the whole world must follow suit should we want to make any progress on keeping global warming well below two degrees. However, the current investments into growing tourism will make it harder to achieve the vision. The long-term future of the region depends on effective climate action, and how to achieve tourism growth sustainably needs to be part of that conversation.\nDr Susanne Becken is a professor of sustainable tourism at Griffith University, Australia.\n",

Yet Japanese carmaker Toyota claims that by 2027 motorists will be able to buy such a vehicle. Running the air conditioner at full blast might reduce such an impressive range, but Toyota says drivers will be able to recharge in 10 minutes before they are back on the road. If this all sounds too good to be true, that\u2019s because it probably is.What Toyota says it has found is nothing less than the holy grail of battery technology \u2013 the so-called solid state solution \u2013 which has long eluded the industry. Instead of a liquid core, the new battery has a solid one between electrodes. This means it is smaller and can store more energy \u2013 delivering a bigger range for the same weight. The heavy flammable liquid cores can also overheat and explode. Since 2017, UK emergency services have attended hundreds of electric vehicle fires.Rapid technological advances have historically been the norm in capitalism. Rich-world governments have rightly come to see electric cars as an essential way to reduce air pollution and crack down on climate-warming emissions, while satisfying an individual\u2019s desire for personal transportation. Compared with combustion-engine cars, they have significant environmental benefits. But the climate crisis should be a chance to question whether the motorcar itself has become too embedded in our everyday lives. The future of \u201cmobility\u201d must involve much more than private cars.It would be churlish not to recognise that the Japanese carmaker\u2019s announcement is a form of progress. There should be a sensible place for cars as part of an integrated transport plan in the years to come. As Toyota has been a sceptical voice about electric vehicles, a change of heart, if sincere, is to be welcomed. The company had previously staked its future on its range of hybrid-engine cars, powered by both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, arguing that shortages of key battery materials and insufficient charging infrastructure would prevent a universal switch to electric vehicles in the short term. Whether Toyota will be able to leapfrog its rivals remains to be seen, however, as mass production requires a far more stringent level of quality control and reliability.But even a low-carbon-emitting car remains a low-capacity mode of transportation. Doubling down on its near-monopoly over the surface transportation system would lead to a future of ever-worsening congestion and road accidents, which currently cost 30 lives in the UK every week. Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla, allegedly tried to kill the California high-speed rail project in 2013. A decade later the electric bullet train has announced it will be solar-powered. Industry lobbying in the 1930s helped pave the way for a US lifestyle dependent on cars and oil. That must not be replicated for electric vehicles today.The global north cannot just bet on a Toyota- or Tesla-style decarbonisation. The volume of critical minerals needed for decarbonising the rich world on its current growth path would leave nothing for poorer nations. Sunsetting undesirable technologies and infrastructures (such as carbon-intensive motoring) must be accompanied by a recognition that we all have to live within the world\u2019s material constraints. In the richer world that must mean prioritising mass transportation and rethinking urban planning, not vesting so much hope in our current pattern of living continuing unchanged.",

But while some researchers have suggested that urbanisation might be making foxes and other wildlife bolder and smarter, few studies have directly tested how they compare with rural foxes when confronted with the same challenges.To investigate their boldness and willingness to solve problems, Dr Blake Morton at the University of Hull and his colleagues presented wild and urban foxes with puzzle feeders \u2013 simple contraptions that required them to lift, pull or rotate a lid or lever to access food \u2013 at 104 locations across England and Scotland, including parks, gardens, woodland, meadows and farmland.Morton said: \u201cThese were all devices that we had tested with foxes, so we knew they were able to solve these puzzles \u2013 but we wanted to know whether or not they were willing to do it.\u201dThe study, published in Animal Behaviour, found that foxes at most locations acknowledged the puzzles, but only those at 31 locations touched them, while foxes in just 12 locations gained access to the food.Although urban foxes were more likely to physically interact with the puzzle feeders, suggesting they might be bolder, there was no difference in their willingness to persist to try to gain access to the food inside.\u201cAlthough we found a tendency for London foxes to behave bolder and exploit the puzzles, many other foxes in our study were too shy or unmotivated to exploit them despite having access for up to two weeks,\u201d Morton said.\u201cJust because you\u2019re a city fox doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll be a bold fox, and just because you\u2019re a bold fox doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re going to raid bins. I think that\u2019s a really important reminder that animals, just like people, are very nuanced in their behaviour.\u201dWhen they left the same food out for them to access freely, all of the foxes ate it. \u201cOur conclusion is that they do like the food, but they don\u2019t like the effort,\u201d said Morton.He hopes the study will challenge the common stereotype of urban foxes as bin-raiding menaces. Although this sometimes happens, \u201cwe don\u2019t think that most foxes are willing to raid bins \u2013 and if they do, there\u2019s probably something else going on that drives them to do it\u201d, he said.\u201cBased on our study, we think that sources of food that are very low risk, and very easy to get access to \u2013 so things that don\u2019t have lids or don\u2019t have any physical barriers \u2013 are what a fox might love.\u201d",

The change of heart puts it on a growing list of at least 20 countries, including Brazil, France, Germany, Sweden and Canada, calling for a pause on supporting exploration licences, at least until the environmental effects of seabed exploitation are better understood. Even car manufacturers such as BMW and Volvo, and the car battery maker Samsung, have pledged not to use deep-sea minerals in vehicles.On Monday, the environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, said a UK-based environmental science network on deep-sea mining would be launched, to gather data and help fill in gaps in evidence on the environmental impact of mining. It would use its scientific expertise to \u201cfully understand the impact of deep-sea mining on precious ecosystems, and in the meantime we will not support or sponsor any exploitation licences\u201d, Coffey said.What\u2019s at stake if we mine the deep sea? \u2013 podcastRead moreIn July, the Labour party urged the government to back the proliferating calls for a precautionary pause on deep-sea mining \u201cunless and until\u201d there was clear scientific evidence that it could be done safely and with new regulations to protect the marine environment.Monday marks the beginning of fresh negotiations at the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a quasi-UN body charged with regulating the industry in international waters. It met in July but no decision was reached on whether to allow production to go ahead. Member states agreed, however, to discuss a moratorium.The UK government holds two exploration licences to extract metals from the floor of the Pacific Ocean. It is among 14 countries sponsoring exploration or research contracts \u2013 the only type allowed so far \u2013 by companies intent on mining the deep sea. The others are China, Russia, South Korea, India, France, Poland, Brazil, Japan, Jamaica, Belgium, Nauru, Tonga and Kiribati.Mining companies say that harvesting minerals, including copper, nickel and cobalt, from the ocean instead of land is cheaper and less environmentally damaging.Scientists and environmental groups counter that less than 1% of the world\u2019s deep seas have been explored, and warn that deep-sea mining could unleash noise, light and suffocating dust storms. In June, the European Academies Science Advisory Council warned of \u201cdire consequences\u201d for marine ecosystems should deep-sea mining go ahead. Scientists have also expressed concerns about spills of fuels and about other chemicals used in the mining process.\u201cDeep-sea mining poses an existential threat to some of the most vulnerable, least explored habitats on the planet,\u201d said Clare Brooke, chief executive of the conservation organisation Blue Marine Foundation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A wider HEI review in 2022 reached similar conclusions for connections with lung cancer and cases of new asthma in children and adults.The latest review scrutinised nearly 200 research studies that looked at air pollution and death rates including those from heart disease, stroke, respiratory problems and lung cancer. Specifically the review looked at the link with air pollution from traffic, adding to last year\u2019s World Health Organization assessment.We often see estimates for early deaths from breathing polluted air. For the UK this is equivalent to between 29,000 and 43,000 deaths for adults, aged 30 and over, in 2019. For London the latest annual figure is between 3,600 and 4,100 attributable deaths. The new review will add to the evidence that feeds into these assessments and will improve estimates for the changes from policies, such as low emission zones.Looking to the future, even with electrification, traffic will still produce particle pollution from the wear of tyres, roads, and to a lesser extent brakes. The review panel found that few studies had addressed this.Dr Hanna Boogaard, who led the review, said: \u201cAir quality regulations and improvements in vehicular emission-control technologies have contributed to decreases, however, those improvements do not fully offset the growth and increased congestion of the world\u2019s motor vehicles.\u201cTo date, almost all traffic pollution regulations are targeting tailpipe emissions. Vehicles also pollute by resuspending road dust, abrading road surfaces, and wearing brakes and tyres, which leads to emissions of metals such as iron and copper.\u201dProf Barbara Hoffmann of the University of D\u00fcsseldorf, one of the authors of the review, said: \u201cThe evidence is very clear: road traffic does not only kill via accidents but also via the air pollution vehicles emit.\u201dThis week, a report from Imperial College London has highlighted that air pollution damages people\u2019s health from before birth and into old age. Evidence in the report shows current levels of air pollution will be affecting everyone in London, including those living in the least polluted suburbs, and especially those with pre-existing vulnerabilities.",

To the Bajau, a \u201cborder\u201d is merely the farthest distance they can reach by boat.Noted for their exceptional freediving abilities, the Bajau have evolved to have larger spleens, enabling them to stay underwater for up to 10 minutes at depths of 200 feet. Their diet includes a diverse array of sea creatures, including sea cucumbers \u2013 a valuable protein source also used for medical purposes and even as an aphrodisiac.\nOnly about 100 to 200 Bajau families still live on the traditional Lansa houseboats. This one, part of the Bohey Bual community off Bodgaya Island, has 10 sq metres of living space and houses nine people\nAs early as the 15th century, various bands of Bajau migrated between the Philippines and Malaysia\u2019s Sabah region, fostering cultural exchanges and settlements. Life for the Bajau became more complex in the colonial era when Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia created maritime borders in the Sulu zone: these frontiers were established in the Madrid protocol of 1885, without bothering to consider the distribution and diversity of the ethnic groups who lived there.But it was the Malaysian Immigration Act of 1959/1963 that most significantly changed things for the Bajau. This legislation failed to distinguish between asylum seekers, refugees, irregular migrants and undocumented or stateless individuals.\nUsing self-taught carpentry skills, a Bajau can build a fishing boat in about a week without any drawings to work from. \u2018These methods have been delivered from generation to generation, it\u2019s in our genes,\u2019 says Nalu, a Bajau who came from the Philippines 26 years ago\n\nFrom left: a Bajau girl wears a homemade rice powder sunscreen called borak buas; a Bajau family peek out from their stilt house off Bodgaya Island\nSuddenly the Bajau were in a precarious legal situation \u2013 one that worsened during the civil war in the Mindanao region in 1970, compelling numerous Bajau families to set sail for the east coast of Borneo, where they have grappled with Malaysia\u2019s bureaucratic processes ever since \u2013 neither stateless nor citizen.\nUsing dugouts and nets, the Bajau fish the shallow waters around the island for fish, lobsters, sea cucumbers and sea urchins\nAs of 2023, only about 100 to 200 Bajau still live in the traditional \u201cLansa\u201d houseboats near the eastern Malaysian city of Semporna.

The bear was reportedly turning over rocks and rummaging through piles of beached seaweed in search of food.Pink salmon that hatch in rivers in Hokkaido spend the winter in the sea, before returning to streams in Shiretoko between August and October to lay eggs. Brown bears typically lie in wait for the salmon as they make their way upstream, but have been forced to swim in the sea because of the shortage of river fish.\u201cSome bears have grown really thin,\u201d Katsuya Noda, the tour boat operator, told the Asahi Shimbun. \u201cThey are having a tough time, because there are no fish in the rivers, just like last year.\u201dExperts said sea surface temperatures off Hokkaido remained above 20C from mid-July to early August 2021, 5C higher than average for that time of the year.Researchers at Hokkaido University have warned that if global heating continues at its current rate, seawater temperature around the island will rise by up to 10C in the 2090s compared with 1980s levels.Masami Yamanaka, a researcher at the Shiretoko Nature Foundation, told the Asahi that the lack of salmon, combined with a poor acorn harvest, was having a devastating effect on brown bear cubs. \u201cAn estimated 70% to 80% of the cubs born this year are dead,\u201d Yamanaka said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really serious situation.\u201dFishers caught 482,775 pink salmon in rivers in Hokkaido, Japan\u2019s northernmost main island, between 25 July and 5 September in 2020, but only 23,298 last year, according to the Hokkaido Salmon Propagation Association. Given statistical evidence showing that good catches occur every other year, the 2022 haul was surprisingly small.The scarcity of acorns has been blamed for a rise in the number of bear attacks on humans in Hokkaido and other parts of northern Japan, as they venture into populated areas in search of food.A total of 1,056 brown bears were caught and killed in Hokkaido in the year up to April 2022 \u2013 the highest figure on record and the first time the number has exceeded 1,000, according to the prefecture\u2019s government. Of the total, 999 brown bears were exterminated to prevent damage to crops or because they were considered a danger to local people.The number of people injured or killed in incidents involving bears was 14 in the same period, with crop damage estimated at \u00a5262m (\u00a31.44m) \u2013 both the highest figures on record.",

Darwall, the owner of the 1,600-hectare (4,000-acre) Blachford estate on southern Dartmoor, offers pheasant shoots, deerstalking and holiday rentals on his land.On Friday, in a meeting during which the DNPA decided to appeal against the court decision, a spokesperson for the Darwall family embarked on a tirade against the authority. He said on behalf of the landowners that \u201cyou are not behaving as a public authority should. You are behaving like a campaigning organisation\u201d and accused the DNPA of \u201cindulging a mass trespass\u201d.Earlier this year, thousands of campaigners descended on Dartmoor to assert their right to wild camp. However, despite claims by the agent, it was not legally a \u201ctrespass\u201d as there is a right to roam across the national park.The spokesperson said the DNPA had acted in a \u201cbiased\u201d way and criticised it for thinking of funding its appeal with money from the Dartmoor Preservation Association, which has so far raised more than \u00a350,000 for legal fees. The legal case has been costly so far for the DNPA, which has recently had to shut visitor centres because of a lack of funds.The landowner\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cIf you take money from external bodies to fund a legal campaign indeed you encourage that funding \u2026 that is unwise for a public authority.\u201dAt the meeting, the DNPA voted to appeal against the court decision.

        "text": "Italy is sweltering in abnormally high temperatures, but its media appear to be more interested in how the extreme heat is being reported in the foreign press than delving deeply into the effects in a country deemed to be among the most vulnerable in Europe to the climate crisis.Over the weekend, several outlets picked up on reports on Italy\u2019s heatwave in leading foreign news websites \u2013 including the Guardian, the Times and the BBC. They were particularly fascinated by a headline in the Times calling Rome \u2013 where temperatures are forecast to reach highs of 43C on Tuesday \u2013 the \u201cInfernal City\u201d, a play on the nickname \u201cEternal City\u201d. So much so that it was still a talking point come Monday.While there was coverage in Monday\u2019s newspapers of the anticyclone that could push temperatures close to the European record of 48.8C in parts of Sardinia, Puglia and Sicily, most front pages led with the bufera, or storm, caused by the deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, calling for an amnesty for tax evaders.That the climate crisis is not well covered by the Italian media is unsurprising, said Gianni Riotta, the director of the school of journalism at Rome\u2019s Luiss University. \u201cIt is lousy and it has been lousy for years,\u201d he said.Much of this is due to the dominance of the rightwing media, which for decades have been owned or heavily influenced by the late former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Still today, rightwing newspapers such as Il Giornale, Libero and La Verit\u00e0 serve as mouthpieces for Giorgia Meloni\u2019s government, whose strategy on tackling the climate crisis is vague.Greta Thunberg, the Swedish activist, has long been ridiculed by factions of the rightwing press. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that it was the Italian rightwing press which invented the word \u2018Gretina\u2019 in reference to Thunberg,\u201d Riotta said. \u201cOf course, for Italian ears this sounds like cretina (cretin).\u201dRiotta, a former deputy editor of the more centrist newspaper Corriere della Sera, recalled Giuliano Ferrara, a former right-hand man of Berlusconi, who he said was a climate change denier and mounted a strong campaign against climate scientists.\u201cWhenever we did work on the climate crisis, we would be blasted by people saying \u2018this is too much\u2019,\u201d Riotta said.Stefano Caserini, a climate change professor at Milan polytechnic, said: \u201cThere are newspapers on the rightwing side which, if not openly denying the climate crisis, are inactivists. Over the next few years we will experience even more heatwaves, and currently the debate here is not really happening.\u201dA study published last year by ECCO, a climate change thinktank, found that while the majority of Italians were fully aware of the impact of climate change and were ready to take collective action, there was a strong sense of mistrust towards politicians, institutions and the media, as well as a feeling of a lack of representation across the political spectrum on climate issues.Carlo Cacciamani, the chief of Italy\u2019s national meteorological and climatology agency, said last week\u2019s anticyclone was well covered by newspapers such La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera but media coverage generally lacked in-depth insight.\u201cIt\u2019s not that the heat isn\u2019t being discussed, what\u2019s missing is the depth,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be more explanation on why this is happening and what is causing it.\u201dCacciamani said part of the problem was that the climate crisis theme \u201cgets forgotten about\u201d beyond the emergency of an extreme weather event. \u201cDuring normal periods the theme needs to be prioritised \u2013 we need the media more than ever, and the process involves much more than just giving \u2018shock\u2019 news at the time of an event,\u201d he said.",

        "text": "A collection of pressed flowers taken from the hillsides of Bologna 500 years ago is unlocking knowledge about how the climate crisis and human migration is changing landscapes in northern Italy.Picked between 1551 and 1586 by the Renaissance naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi, the 5,000 delicately cut and dried plants form one of the richest collections of its time.The collection contains 5,000 dried plants picked by the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi. Photograph: Archivio Gbb/AlamyAldrovandi\u2019s original purpose was to identify plant species and understand which could be used for pharmaceutical purposes. Nearly half a millennium later, his carefully pressed specimens are helping botanists document the enormous changes that have taken place in the surrounding landscapes, according to new research published by the Royal Society.During Aldrovandi\u2019s time, Bologna\u2019s hills were rich in species that are threatened or have even disappeared today, such as motherwort, which was used for medicinal purposes and is now likely extinct in the region. The total number of the species has increased since 1500s, but the quality of the flora has decreased, with many rarer species declining, researchers said. The Italian population increased by 560% during the study period.Aldrovandi\u2019s herbarium is made up of 15 books, each containing up to 580 specimens glued to sheets. The collection includes notes on species\u2019 frequency, abundance, ecology, local names and uses in folk medicine. Researchers believe it is the oldest example of a herbarium containing such detailed notes. \u201cFrom a historical and scientific perspective\u201d, the researchers write, \u201cthe importance of this herbarium is inestimable.\u201d\u201cAldrovandi\u2019s herbarium preserves the memory of the first signs of a radical transformation of the European flora and habitats,\u201d the paper says.Leaves belonging to Cucurbita pepo \u2013 one of the oldest domesticated species \u2013 which yields varieties of courgettes, as well as squash and pumpkin. Photograph: Alma Mater Studiorum/Biblioteca Universitaria di BolognaOne part of that transformation is the huge influx of non-native species. At the time the collection was formed, just 4% of flowers were American species, which were almost exclusively cultivated in private or botanical gardens. Plants such as sweet pepper and courgettes were imported thanks to early exploration in Central and South America. Since then, there has been a 1,000% increase in non-native flowers from the Americas, which illustrates the growing importance of American-European trade routes from the Renaissance onwards.\u201cWe would never expect to see such a strong difference,\u201d said the lead researcher, Dr Fabrizio Buldrini from the University of Bologna. \u201cThese increases are frightening, in some respects, because they are the unequivocal sign of profound human impact.\u201dBuldrini\u2019s team compared flora collected by Aldrovandi with collections made by Girolamo Cocconi (1883) and records compiled in the Emilia-Romagna region between 1965 and 2021. They looked at the plains area surrounding the River Po and its tributaries, where they could make comparisons across the datasets.\u2018Just keep going\u2019: the horse-riding 97-year-old botanist battling for England\u2019s wildflowersRead moreThe data also shows the effects of the \u201clittle ice age\u201d, which extended through to the mid-1800s. High mountain species such as the silver cranesbill are typically found more than 1,700 metres above sea level, but Cocconi found it at 800 metres above sea level. The mountain buttercup is now only found above 1,000 metres, but during the \u201clittle ice age\u201d it was found at 300 metres.Aldrovandi also helped create the city\u2019s botanical garden, one of the earliest in Europe. A number of important collections were made around his time and in the centuries after, with Bologna becoming a \u201csort of cradle of modern botany and herbaria\u201d.A scan of Gymnadenia conopsea, known as the fragrant orchid, collected in Bologna between 1565 and 1568.

There is nothing more wrong: herbaria are indispensable and irreplaceable databanks for many research fields,\u201d said Buldrini.Global collections contain 390 million specimens, according to the Index Herbariorum.

        "text": "As the cold war thawed in the 1980s, the frozen high north of the planet was a leading beneficiary of more conciliatory times. Speaking in Murmansk in 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev called for an end to military competition in the Arctic, and a new focus on preserving its unique ecosystem. \u201cThe community and interrelationship of the interests of our entire world,\u201d said the Soviet leader, \u201cis felt in the northern part of the globe, in the Arctic, perhaps more than anywhere else.\u201dMr Gorbachev\u2019s words paved the way for a cross-state consensus around the idea of \u201cArctic exceptionalism\u201d \u2013 an agreement that in an environmentally crucial region, where Europe, North America and Asia meet, geopolitical rivalries should be put to one side. Since 1996, the Arctic Council, comprising the eight Arctic states including Russia, has embodied that spirit of cooperation. It is yet another disastrous consequence of Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine that it is now at risk.Since Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022, the council\u2019s western members have rightly refused a business-as-usual approach with Moscow. At a scientific level, this has meant lack of access to crucial data and the pausing of joint projects. That is no small matter, given that 40% of the Arctic is Russian. Meanwhile, the region\u2019s natural resources \u2013 increasingly accessible due to disappearing sea ice \u2013 are being sucked into the fallout of Mr Putin\u2019s war. In the sanctions-hit Kremlin, the alarming pace of global heating in the Arctic is being viewed primarily as an economic opportunity in tough times.Turning away from Europe, Mr Putin is stepping up collaboration on Arctic projects with China, following President Xi Jingping\u2019s recent visit to Moscow. In March, Russia announced the creation of a joint working body with Beijing to develop the Northern Sea Route, which connects the eastern and western parts of the Arctic Ocean. An \u201cenergy superhighway\u201d between Europe and Asia has become a high-priority strategic goal. China has already declared its aspirations for a \u201cpolar silk road\u201d linking the two continents.As well as facilitating shipping routes, melting sea ice promises much easier access to abundant untapped oil reserves, gas and raw materials. In 2008, the United States Geological Survey estimated that the Arctic region contained the equivalent of more than 400bn recoverable barrels of oil. The exploitation of such resources, along with natural gas, would be entirely incompatible with global climate targets, and the European Union has committed to keeping Arctic oil and gas in the ground. But Russia is expanding its operations, not contracting them.The clear danger is that the breakdown of collaboration in the region, combined with Russia\u2019s pivot to the east, leads to what the Finnish foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, has described as \u201can Arctic area with no common goal for climate change\u201d. Given that respect for the sovereignty of states is one of the Arctic Council\u2019s founding principles, it is difficult to see how Russia can be treated as a normal member while its war continues. On the other hand, the development of a competing Sino-Russian strategy for the region, making it a new theatre of great-power rivalry, is a deeply alarming prospect. Last week it was reported that the 2030s will see the first ice-free Arctic summers. The far north of the world has entered a zone of dangerous geopolitical uncertainty.",

        "text": "Ella Roberta Adoo-Kissi-Debrah was a remarkable child. Energetic, joyful, active \u2013 she loved playing sport, reading books and making music. But living close to the South Circular Road in Lewisham, south London, from the age of seven she began to develop a chest infection and persistent cough. A happy, healthy child was disabled by chronic asthma.As her condition deteriorated, she suffered seizures and breathing problems, and was shifted from hospital to hospital. Ella died aged nine, in the early hours of 15 February 2013 \u2013 10 years ago today.After tireless campaigning from her mother Rosamund, including a second inquest into her death in 2020, Ella became the first person in the UK to have air pollution listed as a cause of death on her death certificate in 2020.When I raised Ella\u2019s case at prime minister\u2019s questions two weeks ago, Rishi Sunak offered \u201cthoughts and hearts\u201d to Ella\u2019s family. But in the words of Rosamund herself, being thought of on this day is nice \u2013 \u201cbut it\u2019s not going to change anything, is it?\u201dAnd change is desperately needed. If you thought tragic cases like Ella\u2019s were a one-off, think again. A global study has linked almost a million stillbirths a year to air pollution exposure, and it is as bad as smoking in increasing the risk of miscarriage. Long-term exposure to even relatively low levels of air pollution can cause depression and anxiety. About 300,000 lung cancer deaths globally in 2019 were attributed to air pollution.If ministers were really thinking of Ella and her family on this day, they would adopt Ella\u2019s law. Formally known as the clean air (human rights) bill, this legislation would make clean air a human right for all. It would give parents like Rosamund, who have lost children to air pollution, the right to take legal action under UK law and the resources to make that a reality.\u2018Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey \u2018would have loved\u2019 to set the PM2.5 target at 2030, but was unable to do so as it is \u2018unachievable\u2019.\u2019 Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesIt would also establish a citizens\u2019 commission on clean air \u2013 which would review government progress towards air pollution goals annually and advise ministers to tighten them if necessary. And crucially, it would require the government to reduce levels of PM2.5, one of the most toxic pollutants, to 10 micrograms a cubic metre by 2030, rather than the current target of 2040.This bill is going through parliament right now. And it has already, thanks to my Green colleague Jenny Jones, successfully passed through all stages in the House of Lords. But in the Commons, where I am now championing the bill, it has met roadblocks and murky misinformation.The environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, stated last week that she \u201cwould have loved\u201d to set the PM2.5 target at 2030, as in the clean air bill, but was unable to do so as it is \u201cunachievable\u201d. This is not only an utterly bizarre statement, it\u2019s also fundamentally wrong. A report by Imperial College London found that 97% of the country could reach the 10 micrograms target by 2030. The remaining 3% consists of hotspots in London that, with targeted support in the next few years, could certainly meet the requirements.This target hasn\u2019t been plucked from obscurity. It matches the European Commission\u2019s proposals for 2030. The chair of the Office for Environmental Protection, the government\u2019s own environmental watchdog, recommended a 2030 target at a session of the environmental audit committee last week. The mayor of London has long supported a 2030 target. And the World Health Organization recommended that levels of PM2.5 should not exceed the 10 micrograms a cubic metre threshold as long ago as 2005.\u2018Remember me\u2019: Ella\u2019s law would be fitting legacy after London air pollution death, says motherRead moreBut Coffey\u2019s statement raises another question. What kind of government would refuse to adopt targets on the basis that they\u2019re too stringent, too rigorous, too beneficial for people\u2019s health and the environment?There has been progress within this government. Michael Gove\u2019s recent plan to adopt Awaab\u2019s law, to tackle mouldy and damp homes and improve indoor air pollution shows that some ministers are starting to wake up to this public health crisis.But for Sunak to suggest at PMQs that his government\u2019s measures on air pollution are \u201cworld-leading\u201d is an outrage. Government data released this week shows that it breached its own national legal ceiling for PM2.5 in 2021. \u201cWorld-lagging\u201d would be more appropriate.The longer ministers hide behind misinformation and make excuses, the more people will get sick and die because of our toxic, dirty air.

        "text": "UN climate talks this year might skirt the vital question of whether and how to phase out fossil fuels, as nations have not yet agreed to discuss the issue, one of the top officials hosting the talks has said.Majid Al Suwaidi, director-general of the Cop28 climate talks for its host nation, the United Arab Emirates, said governments were not in agreement over whether the phaseout of fossil fuels should be on the agenda for the conference, which begins in November.\u201cRemember, there are two sides of this discussion. There are many on one side of the discussion who would like to see the kind of language of phasing out fossil fuels,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are others in other different circumstances in different situations, who have different views on how that language should be formulated. And I think that that\u2019s what the process is about \u2013 bringing everybody together with differing views and finding that common ground that works for everyone.\u201dAl Suwaidi has attended many conferences of the party (Cop) meetings under the UN framework convention on climate change. The UAE has come under fire for its choice of Sultan Al Jaber, the head of the country\u2019s national oil company, Adnoc, as president of Cop28.Adnoc is planning major increases in its oil and gas production capacity. On Thursday, civil society groups in Bonn will protest against \u201cconflicts of interest\u201d over Al Jaber\u2019s dual role in the negotiations. A preparatory session for Cop28, is being held this week in Bonn.Al Suwaidi said fossil fuels would form a key part of the discussions at Cop28, but whether a phaseout would be discussed as part of the official agenda of the talks was still up for grabs. \u201cOur presidency is here for whatever the parties\u2019 consensus is. The parties\u2019 consensus is to have a discussion around fossil fuels. And we will support having a discussion around fossil fuels. It\u2019s really up to the parties decide what they want to have on the agenda as part of this process,\u201d he told the Guardian.\u201cThat\u2019s what we as a presidency are focused on: finding the solutions that will allow everyone to go away feeling that they made significant progress and feel that it was worth the discussion.\u201dBut he added that there would still be a role for fossil fuels, even if the world targeted net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, which scientists say is necessary to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its latest comprehensive report on climate science, noted that there could be a small role for oil and gas, if used alongside technologies to remove carbon dioxide, even in 2050, when the world must reach net zero.Al Suwaidi said: \u201cWe know that that the energy mix that is going to achieve net zero is, if we\u2019re serious about this conversation, going to include fossil fuels in some form. So I think that the discussion has to be about what is the proper mix, what is the proper language that allows us to achieve the emissions reductions that we need to achieve while allowing different pathways for different countries to achieve the net zero target.\u201dBut several prominent climate scientists, including IPCC authors, told the Guardian they were concerned about the IPCC findings being taken in this way. Although there could be a small amount of fossil fuel used while achieving this net zero, this should be minimal and not taken as a licence for fossil fuel producers to continue their operations, the scientists warned.Al Jaber, who will attend the Bonn talks on Thursday, met the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and several top EU officials on Wednesday. In a statement emerging from that meeting, they did not mention the phaseout of fossil fuels, but referred instead to pursuing \u201cenergy systems free of unabated fossil fuels\u201d.The word unabated usually refers to the use of technology to capture and store carbon dioxide (CCS). Al Suwaidi also defended the use of CCS, which he said could be used to help avoid breaching the 1.5C limit.\u201cWe can\u2019t be exclusive [of CCS],\u201d he said. \u201cWe need every solution on the table, every solution that works for different people is a good solution. There\u2019s no silver bullet here.\u201dHoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC, warned against over-reliance on CCS, in an interview with the Guardian at Bonn. He said it was \u201cno free lunch\u201d and that it would be expensive and difficult to implement, meaning there was a danger the world would continue to heat and overstep planetary boundaries, known as tipping points, that could trigger severe impacts from the climate crisis.",

        "text": "Where has Storm Babet come from?Areas of low pressure have been pushing northwards across France, through the Channel and towards the UK and Ireland. According to Metdesk, strong winds from an east to south-easterly direction as opposed to the usual south-westerly direction that prevails across north-west Europe, are due to hit eastern Scotland and many eastern counties of England.On Wednesday, the Met Office issued a red weather warning for parts of eastern Scotland.What are the expected impacts?The Met Office\u2019s chief meteorologist, Jason Kelly, says: \u201cEastern parts of Scotland will see exceptional amounts of rainfall over the next few days and the significant accumulations are likely to cause considerable impacts from Storm Babet.\u201cNumerous amber and yellow rainfall warnings are in place for rainfall over the coming days, up to and including Saturday, but in the red warning area 100-150mm of rain is expected to fall quite widely, with some locations possibly seeing 200-220mm, which is expected to cause considerable impacts, with flooding likely.\u201dThere are warnings of the possibilities of a danger to life from floodwater, extensive flooding to homes and businesses and severely disrupted travel conditions.Which areas will be worst affected?The latest Met Office red weather warning covers Aberdeenshire, Angus, Dundee, and Perth and Kinross. The warning is in place from 6pm on Thursday until noon on Friday.What level of rainfall is expected?Some locations may see 200-250mm of rain, which is heavy, even for Scotland. The record for the most rain in one day was in 1974, when 238mm fell at the Sloy power station by Loch Lomond.How often are red warnings issued?According to the Met Office, red warnings are relatively rare as they are reserved for the most extreme weather impacts. Normally only one or two would be issued a year. This is the first red warning in 2023.How many red warnings have been issued?Of the dozen or so red warnings issued from 2011 to 2018, according to Metdesk, the vast majority were in December and January.There was a red warning for rain when Storm Dennis hit Wales in 2020, and one for wind in 2021 when Storm Arwen ran down the east coast of the UK.In July 2022 a red warning for extreme heat was issued in central and southern England, and earlier that year Storm Eunice triggered two red warnings for wind, covering areas of south-west and south-east England.Is the storm related to climate breakdown?It is too early to make an assessment of that kind. However, extreme rainfall is more common and more intense because of human-caused climate breakdown across most of the world, particularly in Europe, most of Asia, central and eastern North America, and parts of South America, Africa and Australia.Flooding has most likely become more frequent and severe in these locations as a result, but is also affected by human factors, such as the existence of flood defences and land use.",

But, says the supermarket, they are typically thrown away by customers, contributing to up to 700 tonnes of food waste a year.Removing the crown during the production process will mean the leaves can either be replanted in the pineapple fields or shredded and given to local farmers to be used for animal feed.Pineapples account for about 20% of global tropical fruit production.

The safety information provided about chemicals will be reduced to an \u201cirreducible minimum\u201d, which campaigners say will leave the UK \u201clagging far behind the EU\u201d.The UK\u2019s scheme, called UK Reach, is falling behind the EU\u2019s as it is. The UK has not been part of the bloc\u2019s chemicals regulations scheme, EU Reach, since 2021. Eight rules restricting the use of hazardous chemicals have been adopted by the EU since Brexit, and 16 more are in the pipeline. The UK has not banned any substances in that time and is considering just two restrictions, on lead ammunition and harmful substances in tattoo ink.Campaigners have called for the government to follow EU chemicals regulations as standard, diverging only if and when there is a good reason to do so. This would free up time and money for regulators and mean dangerous chemicals banned by the EU do not enter the environment before there is time to ban them.Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said the government was \u201cfalling behind, leaving UK wildlife and consumers exposed to more toxic chemicals than our European neighbours\u201d.He said the new scheme would \u201cbe a misguided step in the wrong direction, permanently damaging the ability of UK regulators to identify and prevent harmful chemical pollution\u201d.Benwell said the new regulations prioritised cost savings for the chemicals industry over environmental protections, leaving \u201cpublic health and nature to pay the price\u201d.As an alternative, he said: \u201cThe government should commit to follow EU chemical restrictions as standard. It should also treat chemically-similar substances in groups to stop almost identical substances appearing on the market. This would free up time and money to follow global best practice, learning from countries around the world when other toxic risks are identified.\u201dRuth Chambers, of the Greener UK coalition, added: \u201cThe government promised that its new post-Brexit chemicals system would maintain high standards. Reducing safety information to an \u2018irreducible minimum\u2019 does not instil confidence that the new UK system will put the health of consumers and the environment first. The UK will be lagging badly behind the EU.\u201dThere are concerns that the UK regime is much less muscular than the EU\u2019s, with less funding and fewer staff to work through lists of chemicals to see if they are enough of a danger to health and the environment to ban.Chloe Alexander, the UK chemicals campaigner at CHEM Trust, a charity that aims to stop synthetic chemicals from causing long-term damage to humans and wildlife, said: \u201cThese proposals demonstrate the faults of a standalone system which insists on being independent of EU Reach \u2013 that makes it extremely difficult to minimise costs on industry without leaving consumers and the environment less protected from harmful chemicals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The study, published in the journal Science, suggests locations with 250 visible stars at present will have just 100 visible stars in 18 years.\u201cIf these trends continue, eventually it will be very difficult to see anything at all in the sky, even the brightest constellations. Orion\u2019s belt will start to disappear at some point,\u201d said Dr Christopher Kyba, of the German Research Centre for Geoscience and first author of the research.Milky Way no longer visible to one third of humanity, light pollution atlas showsRead moreThe team write that the glow produced by artificial lighting grew exponentially over the 20th century with population growth, new technologies, and expansion of towns and cities.However the impact of a shift to light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in recent years is unclear. Satellites that can measure skyglow have limited resolution and cannot detect some wavelengths of light emitted by LEDs.To delve deeper, the team analysed 51,351 citizen scientist observations of stars visible to the naked eye, made between 2011 and 2022 as part of a project called Globe at Night. Participants were asked to use a website to view a selection of star charts for their location \u2013 each showing an incrementally greater number of the stars that exist in that patch of sky \u2013 and pick the chart that best matched what they could see. The researchers then created a model that related the number of visible stars to the brightness of the night sky.While the citizen science observations were rarely made multiple times in the exact same location, the researchers were able to group those with similar brightness of the night sky in a given year, and record the change over time.In 2016, scientists found the Milky Way was no longer visible to one-third of humanity. Photograph: Amr Dalsh/ReutersThe results reveal that on average across locations where participants made observations, sky brightness is increasing by 9.6% a year, with the figure slightly lower, at 6.5%, in Europe and slightly higher, at 10.4%, in North America.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It appears as if a bomb went off, he has said.But no amount of warning can prepare people for seeing their homes, or a community they knew and loved, wiped off the map. \u201cOh my god,\u201d two Maui residents who traveled to the town with a van delivering medical aid from the humanitarian group Direct Relief repeated to themselves as the sprinter van wound its way through the ruins.The difference between seeing disasters on the news and having your community experience one firsthand is stark, said Felipe Hannel, a Maui resident who was helping deliver supplies with Direct Relief.\u201cYou see it on TV. You feel sorry for everybody. Maybe you lose sleep for a night, but then life keeps going,\u201d Hannel said. \u201cBut when you know the place, it\u2019s different. You\u2019re crying. You get so emotionally involved. You know these people, you know their lives.\u201dJust north of the devastated blocks of Lahaina, shopping centers have been transformed into resource hubs for those on the still closed western side of the island. Doctors distribute medical supplies, volunteers offer clothes and toiletries. In the parking lot of one plaza, in between Super Cuts, a spa and a DMV office, chefs with the World Central Kitchen served meals to families returning to the area. Meanwhile, the smell of smoke lingers, as if someone had just lit a match.",

Water consumption in Gotland has fallen by 5% thanks to the competition and other measures.Mimmi Gibson of the municipality said: \u201cIt\u2019s a gentle way to nudge people into action and it automatically turns you into a climate hero by not doing anything. We need to start the conversation on how to save water. It\u2019s a global problem. Sometimes, there\u2019s pressure on people to keep their lawn really green and tidy and lush and it can be easier to say \u2018I\u2019m in this competition, I don\u2019t need to water my lawn.\u2019\u201dMurray previously shrugged off criticism of her lawn by calling it \u201ca paddock\u201d, or claiming she\u2019s waiting for the grass to grow so she can cut hay, but is now happy to talk about the biodiversity benefits of her laid-back gardening style.Murray said she used to think of bandicoots as weapons of garden destruction but now says they ensure she\u2019ll never have to mow her lawn againBlue-tongue lizards, kangaroos, wallabies and pademelons all visit from the neighbouring nature reserve. \u201cI\u2019ve chosen to make my place an extension of the nature reserve because it is right beside it. That\u2019s another excuse for me not watering my lawn. Do you water Cradle Mountain? No. It just looks after itself. By and large, that\u2019s what\u2019s happened.\u201dThe jury took nearly two hours of deliberations to reach their verdict on the ugliest lawn.\u201cAll of them were hideous and well worthy of winning but the winning entry was really, really bad,\u201d said Gibson.Diarmuid Gavin, the garden designer and broadcaster who was also a member of the jury, said it was the weirdest competition he had been asked to judge but he hoped it would encourage people to ditch old attachments to green lawns and create climate-appropriate gardens.\u201cSeeing a lawn in Tasmania like this, wondering why there\u2019s a prize for the world\u2019s worst lawn, really makes people think but with that sense of humour, without lecturing or hectoring,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Tasmanian garden was soulful because it had an understanding of what\u2019s happening. If we\u2019re lucky enough to look after a piece of land, we all need to be thinking gardeners now. The moral imperative isn\u2019t so much to fit in, or not let the neighbourhood down, it\u2019s to not let the planet down.\u201dMurray added: \u201cYou\u2019ve got a choice to make \u2013 do you want farmers to have enough water to produce food for a growing human population or do you want to play some type of lawn nazi competition with your neighbours to make them jealous of how green your lawn is?\u201d\u201cIt brings me a lot of joy to see all the little creatures who now feel safe to come out during the day in my back yard \u2013 they\u2019ve got camouflage, they have happy digging areas.

Reports of Shell and British Gas\u2019s profits in the first six months of 2023 has reignited the debate over how politicians balance the cost of pursuing the target with keeping voters onside.British Gas reported its highest-ever first-half profits, of almost \u00a31bn, while Shell has reported profits of just over $5bn (\u00a33.9bn) for the second quarter of the year.Miliband said Sunak had been \u201cdragged kicking and screaming\u201d to implement a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. The existing policy was like a \u201cSwiss cheese\u201d and \u201cfull of holes\u201d, the Labour frontbencher claimed.He called for the current rate, 75% of profits, to be upped to 78%, and criticised the so-called super-deduction that allows companies to reduce their payment if they invest in British energy projects, saying Labour would close the \u201cloophole\u201d.\u201cThese are unearned, unexpected profits,\u201d Miliband told BBC Breakfast \u201cThis is because Russia launched an appalling invasion of Ukraine and drove gas prices up.\u201cThe only long-term answer is to move off fossil fuels as quickly as we can because even though we imported very small amounts from Russia before the war, we\u2019ve been so badly affected as a country.\u201cThat\u2019s why the drive to increase onshore wind, solar energy, offshore wind \u2013 cheaper than fossil fuels \u2013 is the right answer for the country. And my regret is not just that we don\u2019t have a proper windfall tax, it\u2019s that we don\u2019t have a government committed to that green sprint either.\u201dUnder a Labour government, Miliband said the \u201cnorth star\u201d of its energy plans would be a drive to ensure all electricity comes from zero-carbon sources by 2030, which he added would cut bills across the economy by \u00a393bn.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The regional police commander claimed that they were killed by wild animals while illegally entering the park, according to a report published by the institute on Thursday.More than 21,000 people from dozens of villages around Ruaha are also facing eviction by the government, it claimed.Anuradha Mittal, the executive director of the Oakland Institute, said: \u201c[The] Regrow project is not about protecting wildlife or conservation. Instead, the bank is financing an oppressive and violent economic growth model based on boosting tourism revenues.\u201dMittal said the World Bank should have scrutinised the Tanzanian government\u2019s record on human rights before financing it. The government authorised evictions close to the same area in 2006 and has been criticised for its handling of forced evictions in northern Tanzania, which \u201cshould have triggered internal alarm before the bank decided to finance the project\u201d, added Mittal. \u201cInstead, it looked the other way and continues to do so. It should be held accountable.\u201dThe institute said villagers were told in October 2022 they would have to leave their land despite holding title deeds, which the government has cancelled, claiming the property fell within the boundaries of the national park.More than 850 villagers have challenged the evictions in Tanzania\u2019s high court.A Maasai man in Loliondo \u2013 1,000km away from Ruaha \u2013 who claims he was was shot in the back by Tanzanian security forces.

Photograph: Daniel Irungu/EPATwo community members, with the help of Oakland, have also submitted a complaint to the World Bank saying they had not been consulted about the evictions or provided adequate resettlement plans for the projects, which were causing \u201charm to their identity, culture and rights\u201d.A community leader who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity called the government\u2019s actions \u201cheavy-handed and unlawful\u201d. He said communities in more than 40 villages will lose ancestral and lawfully owned land.\u201cMany farmers were barred from cultivating their farms this year causing hunger and poverty. Many of the residents of the villages in question face an uncertain future and psychological pain,\u201d he said.\u201cI want the World Bank to immediately halt the project and conduct forensic investigation on the allegations of gross violation of human rights in the project area.\u201dRoland Ebole, an Amnesty International researcher focusing on Tanzania and Uganda, said abuses around the park have been reported since 2008 when the government first began to scope out plans for its expansion.\u2018It\u2019s becoming a war zone\u2019: Tanzania\u2019s Maasai speak out on \u2018forced\u2019 removalsRead more\u201cWe find villagers being accused of herding inside areas they have been restricted from and they are told to pay fines of high amounts or have their cattle confiscated.

But with more than 410,000 hectares of forest burned since January \u2013 more than double the amount typically burned in an entire season.Alberta has seen more than 6,500 applications for emergency financial assistance and paid out nearly C$2m; 16,470 remain displaced throughout the province.\u2018Like Nagasaki\u2019: devastating wildfires will only get worse, new book warnsRead moreRural Indigenous communities are often on the frontlines of climate change and have been among the hardest-hit in the recent fires.

On 9 May, the air turned beige, lightning crackled, and thunder rolled from Blackdowns to Quantocks and back again like a timpani section gone mad. The rain, when it finally fell, hammered the freshly ploughed fields, blasting away the topsoil like a pressure washer. Roads turned into rivers, carrying away whatever nutrients farmers had applied, and rivers boiled with frothy Nescaf\u00e9-coloured water.

Climate change, meanwhile, threatens food sources for the young Chinook maturing in the Pacific.Now, ocean salmon fishing season is set to be prohibited this year off California and much of Oregon for the second time in 15 years after adult fall-run Chinook, often known as king salmon, returned to California\u2019s rivers in near record-low numbers in 2022.\u201cThere will be no wild-caught California salmon to eat unless someone has still got some vacuum sealed last year in their freezer,\u201d said John McManus of the Golden State Salmon Association.Experts fear native California salmon, which make up a significant portion of the Pacific north-west\u2019s fishing industry, are in a spiral toward extinction.Much of the salmon caught off Oregon originate in California\u2019s Klamath and Sacramento rivers. After hatching in freshwater, they spend three years on average maturing in the Pacific, where many are snagged by commercial fishermen, before migrating back to their spawning grounds, where conditions are more ideal to give birth. After laying eggs, they die.Already California\u2019s spring-run Chinook are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, while winter-run Chinook are endangered along with the central California coast coho salmon, which has been off-limits to California commercial fishers since the 1990s.The Pacific Fishery Management Council, the authority responsible for setting ocean salmon seasons off the Pacific coast, is expected in early April to formally approve its proposed closure of Chinook fishing along the coast from Cape Falcon in northern Oregon to the California-Mexico border. Salmon season is expected to open as usual north of Cape Falcon, including in the Columbia River and off Washington\u2019s coast.Though the closure will deal a blow to the industry that supports tens of thousands of jobs, few are disputing it.\u201cWe want to make sure they are here for the future,\u201d said third-generation fisherman Garin McCarthy, who described catching a Chinook as \u201cmagical\u201d.McCarthy, whose entire income last year came from salmon fishing off both California and Oregon, has had to invest thousands of dollars in equipment to fish other species like rockfish, halibut and black cod.\u201cWe\u2019re all scrambling to try to make our boats do something different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all salmon trollers. That\u2019s what we do. That\u2019s what we live for.\u201dGlen Spain, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Associations, said he believed the ban might need to be in place for two or three years to bring back sustainable stocks after many fish died in 2020, the start of a record dry period.The Chinook already faced challenges, with dams blocking their historic retreats to the chilly upper reaches of northern California\u2019s Sacramento River and the Klamath River along the California-Oregon border. Decades of development have disrupted the natural flow of rivers and polluted waters.In 2020, the Trump administration ended federal protections for millions of waterways, allowing for more water to be pumped out of the Sacramento River Basin for farming despite warnings from biologists that it could harm salmon runs in the future.Fishers say river water temperatures increased with the diversions for irrigation, killing more eggs and hatchlings and preventing the stocks from bouncing back amid the drought.In 2021, a judge determined the Trump administration improperly limited federal protections and restored them to a narrower 1986 standard. The Biden administration is expected to expand the protections in 2024.Some are banking on the unusually wet winter to bring relief. Record rain and snowfall since late last year have freed two-thirds of California from drought. But too much water could also flush out eggs and hatchlings.Businesses tied to salmon want the government to declare the situation a federal disaster so they may receive aid. As the market shrinks, more restaurants turn to farm-raised salmon, while gear suppliers stop stocking the proper equipment to fish Chinook.",

And that increasing dust may have hidden up to 8% of warming from carbon emissions.The analysis by atmospheric scientists and climate researchers in the US and Europe attempts to tally the varied, complex ways in which dust has affected global climate patterns, concluding that overall, it has worked to somewhat counteract the warming effects of greenhouse gasses. The study, published in Nature Reviews Earth and Environment, warns that current climate models fail to take into account the effect of atmospheric dust.\u201cWe\u2019ve been predicting for a long time that we\u2019re headed toward a bad place when it comes to greenhouse warming,\u201d said Jasper Kok, an atmospheric physicist at UCLA who led the research. \u201cWhat this research shows is that so far, we\u2019ve had the emergency brake on.\u201dRevealed: Exxon made \u2018breathtakingly\u2019 accurate climate predictions in 1970s and 80sRead moreAbout 26m tons of dust are suspended in our atmosphere, scientists estimate. Its effects are complicated.Dust, along with synthetic particulate pollution, can cool the planet in several ways. These mineral particles can reflect sunlight away from the Earth and dissipate cirrus clouds high in the atmosphere that warm the planet. Dust that falls into the ocean encourages the growth of phytoplankton \u2013 microscopic plants in the ocean \u2013 that absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.Dust can also have a warming effect in some cases \u2013 darkening snow and ice, and prompting them to absorb more heat.But after they tallied everything up, it seemed clear to researchers that the dust had an overall cooling effect.\u201cThere are all these different factors that play into the role of mineral dusts in our atmosphere,\u201d said Gisela Winckler, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. \u201cThis is the first review of its kind to really bring all these different aspects together.\u201dAlthough climate models have so far been able to predict global heating with quite a bit of accuracy, Winckler said the review made clear that these predictions haven\u2019t been able to pin down the role of dust especially well.Limited records from ice cores, marine sediment records, and other sources suggest that dust overall had also been increasing since pre-industrial times \u2013 in part due to development, agriculture, and other human impacts on landscapes. But the amount of dust also seems to have been decreasing since the 1980s.More data and research is needed to better understand these dust patterns, Winckler said, and better predict how they will change in coming years.But if dust in the atmosphere is decreasing, the warming effects of greenhouse gases could speed up.\u201cWe could start to experience faster and faster warming because of this,\u201d Kok said. \u201cAnd maybe we\u2019re waking up to that reality too late.\u201d",

The extent of these fires, more than double the size of the previous record, caused more than a dozen fatalities and thousands of evacuations, and sent a plume of smoke that unfurled as far as Norway and, for a time in June, turned the sky above New York City orange.The Hawaii fires are a dire omen of the climate crisis\u2019s cost to Pacific peoples | Kiana DavenportRead moreScientists have now analyzed the conditions that caused the fires that raged in the Canadian province of Quebec between May and July and found that the climate crisis, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, made them at least twice as likely, and the fire-prone weather at least 20% more intense.The attribution study, conducted by a coalition of scientists in Canada, the UK and the Netherlands, found that while the fire-prone weather conditions were unprecedented, they are no longer unexpected and will become more commonplace as the worlds continues to heat up.\u201cThe word \u2018unprecedented\u2019 doesn\u2019t do justice to the severity of the wildfires in Canada this year,\u201d said Yan Boulanger, research scientist at Natural Resources Canada and part of the World Weather Attribution study team.\u201cFrom a scientific perspective, the doubling of the previous burned area record is shocking. Climate change is greatly increasing the flammability of the fuel available for wildfires \u2013 this means that a single spark, regardless of its source, can rapidly turn into a blazing inferno.\u201dThe new study looked at the fire weather index, a metric that gauges the risk of wildfire through a combination of temperature, windspeed, humidity and rainfall, and found that its peak in Quebec from May to July, when there was a huge number of fires, had its chances of occurring doubled because of the climate crisis. The fires in this peak were also 20% more intense because of the climate crisis.While climate change itself doesn\u2019t typically ignite huge forest fires, it helps set the stage for them by drying out vegetation that becomes easy fuel for flames. The early stages of summer were ideal conditions for this, with Canada\u2019s national temperature record for May and June smashed by 0.8C (1.4F), which, along with low humidity and the shrinkage of snow cover, aided the rapid spread of fires across Canada.Philippe Gachon, a researcher at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, said that snow cover has traditionally limited the extent of wildfires in Canada, but that this is changing.\u201cThis year, high temperatures led to the rapid thawing and disappearance of snow during May, particularly in eastern Quebec, resulting in unusually early wildfires,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ongoing loss of snow in a warming climate means that wildfires will burn for many more days each year in Canada.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Bees have long been a source of fascination as well as honey. But the reason why some creepy-crawlies have been classified as pests while others haven\u2019t goes beyond appearances. Horticulturalists, like farmers, generally object to insects that eat what they grow.This hasn\u2019t saved the creatures that don\u2019t consume crops or garden plants. Habitat loss resulting from urbanisation and deforestation, and pesticide use in agriculture, mean that global insect populations are in steep decline. In the UK, the number of flying insects is estimated \u2013 by looking at vehicle number plates \u2013 to have fallen by 58.5% between 2004 and 2021. Awareness of the importance of bees and other pollinators has risen in the past decade. But human dependence on insects goes beyond this. They form a crucial part of multiple ecosystems.The changes in land use and agriculture that will be needed to reverse these alarming trends depend on policymakers. The UK government has broken its promise to replace subsidies under the common agricultural policy with sustainability incentives worth the same amount. It also lags behind France and other countries by continuing to allow non-agricultural pesticide use \u2013 although some local councils have imposed their own bans or phase-outs. Next year\u2019s ban on peat-based garden compost is a positive step but should have happened sooner.Gardeners as well as politicians have a role to play by adopting new techniques, and aesthetics, which reflect the needs of nature. Insects, birds and spiders \u2013 highly visible at this time of year, when many common species breed \u2013 need food and places to nest. Gardeners should include wildlife-friendly trees such as crab apples where possible, and avoid weedkiller as well as insect poisons. Other beneficial changes include planting a greater variety of plants, ideally including some native species (or relatives of natives), which are more hospitable to local wildlife because they evolved in tandem. Last month, Australian scientists showed that planting indigenous species in an urban green space caused insect numbers to multiply by seven times in three years. Artificial turf should be avoided.As the climate heats up, it also makes sense to choose less thirsty plants. Sometimes these are chosen as part of schemes with other environmental benefits. One example that has attracted widespread praise is the Grey to Green regeneration project in Sheffield, a mile-long flood defence area featuring a series of water-collecting rain gardens. Opened in 2020, it also provides a new link to the Castlegate area of the city.Experts as well as amateurs are changing their ways. The Guardian\u2019s Alys Fowler wrote earlier this year about teaching herself to leave aphids and dandelions alone. Others, including Alan Titchmarsh, are more resistant to replacing scented borders with messy nature. But with almost 30% of the total urban area in Britain estimated to consist of residential gardens, what happens in these spaces matters. When so much agricultural land has become a hostile environment for wildlife, chemical-free flowerbeds can be sanctuaries. We don\u2019t have to stop admiring double-headed peonies, which are bred to impress in such a way that bees can\u2019t get to the pollen. But we can make more room for fauna amid the flowers.",

To do something that is quite unique in their history \u2013 to protect what is one of the crown jewels of British sport.Scottish ultra-marathon runner blames injury and jetlag for using car in raceRead more\u201cIt is one of the crown jewels because the everyday person is competing and running those 26.2 miles at the time as Eilish McColgan, Sir Mo Farah, and when the greatest women\u2019s endurance race in the history of our sport is taking place.\u201cThe London Marathon is unique,\u201d he added. \u201cWe run for clean air. That is so important in what we do. The environment is part of our DNA. And Extinction Rebellion has been very, very clear that they are in a new phase of wanting to engage the general public in a different way.\u201dHowever, Brasher admitted that organisers would still be stepping up official security amid fears that other groups may cause similar disruption to that seen at the Grand National and the World Snooker Championship.Brasher is also hoping to speak to Just Stop Oil in the next 24 hours to persuade them to not to stop a race that raised \u00a358.4m for charity last year. Not only did Just Stop Oil try to intervene in last year\u2019s race but on Monday one of its activists sprinkled orange powder over a snooker table at the Crucible.\u201cI have not yet had conversations with Just Stop Oil,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m reaching out to them \u2013 Extinction Rebellion has given me the people to talk to.

It has taken almost 30 years of climate talks for the world to call on nations to transition \u201caway from fossil fuels\u201d in a \u201cjust, orderly and equitable manner\u201d. Cop28\u2019s final text was stating the obvious but it needed saying, and not a moment too soon. Ahead of the Dubai summit, the UN said that under current policies, global temperatures were on track to rise 2.9C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 nearly double the goal cited in the climate summit final declaration.The measures agreed \u2013 to triple renewable capacity and double the rate of energy efficiency \u2013 could limit warming to the 1.5C threshold. But this relies on an equitable climate financing deal for developing countries. On this key issue, the Cop28 outcome had little to say. A report for the UN has stated that developing countries \u2013 excluding China \u2013 would need $2.4tn a year. This is a lot of money, but then what is the price of saving the planet? The US is the richest nation on Earth. It should take the lead as the globe\u2019s largest oil and gas producer. Instead it will expand fossil fuel extraction \u2013 reckless and inexcusable behaviour given Washington\u2019s historical responsibility.However, the economics and politics of the G7 and EU in the last decade have militated against the world coming together to solve the existential crisis. Cop28 could be a turning point. But that would need the rich world to reflect seriously in the year ahead on the state of its democratic discourse. Concerns about the erosion of public services are leading voters who rely on these services in western democracies to question the extent to which their governments care about people like them. This is fertile ground for those whipping up resistance to money being spent abroad \u2013 even if it is to save domestic voters\u2019 lives and livelihoods.This insularity is magnified when the costs of climate crisis policies fall on household budgets. Rich world governments have the fiscal firepower to borrow to invest in greening the economy. But that has been seen as ideologically beyond the pale. The result is that many progressive parties have suffered. In the European parliament, the backlash over the costs of environmental policies may see the Greens lose a quarter of their seats in elections later this year, and benefit far-right nationalists more likely to favour fossil fuels, fewer environmental regulations and less international climate cooperation. Looming over this year\u2019s climate talks was the spectre of Donald Trump regaining the US presidency.The developing world won\u2019t hang around for the wealthy to get their act together. African negotiators held out for \u2013 and got \u2013 a better deal in Dubai. After years of foregrounding private investment, public finance was emphasised in the Cop outcome. It is time to hold rich nations to the words of the 1992 Rio declaration that green tech must be \u201cin the public domain\u201d and made accessible to developing countries \u201cat affordable prices\u201d. However, the overhaul in trade, finance and investment institutional mechanisms that would genuinely benefit developing nations remains a distant prospect.While the UN process continues, the world\u2019s fate rests on a wing and a prayer. Decarbonisation inevitably requires replacing the stock of dirty machines, such as oilwells, with green ones, such as wind turbines. The UN Conference on Trade and Development estimates that 17 frontier technologies \u2013 from artificial intelligence to green hydrogen to biofuels \u2013 could create a market of more than $9.5tn by 2030. But without rewriting the current rules of the game, a few countries, notably the US, China and those in western Europe, will continue to seize most of the value. Whether innovation can drive down the cost of green technologies is important. But just as vital would be to rebalance power towards the rest of the developing world.",

In addition to the six that will be cut down, leaving stumps, four will receive remedial work and the condition of another tree will be assessed.The tangle of branches was made famous by the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, which used it as a stand in for Kingsroad.

As a result, beer may become more expensive and manufacturers will have to adapt their brewing methods.Researchers forecast that hop yields in European growing regions will fall by 4-18% by 2050 if farmers do not adapt to hotter and drier weather, while the content of alpha acids in the hops, which gives beers their distinctive taste and smell, will fall by 20-31%.\u201cBeer drinkers will definitely see the climate change, either in the price tag or the quality,\u201d said Miroslav Trnka, a scientist at the Global Change Research Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences and co-author of the study, published in the journal Nature Communications. \u201cThat seems to be inevitable from our data.\u201dBeer, the third-most popular drink in the world after water and tea, is made by fermenting malted grains like barley with yeast. It is usually flavoured with aromatic hops grown mostly in the middle latitudes that are sensitive to changes in light, heat and water.In recent years, demand for high-quality hops has been pushed up by a boom in craft beers with stronger flavours. But emissions of planet-heating gases are putting the plant at risk, the study found.The researchers compared the average annual yield of aroma hops during the periods 1971-1994 and 1995-2018 and found \u201ca significant production decrease\u201d of 0.13-0.27 tons per hectare. Celje, in Slovenia, had the greatest fall in average annual hop yield, at 19.4%.In Germany, the second-biggest hop producer in the world, average hop yields have fallen 19.1% in Spalt, 13.7% in Hallertau, and 9.5% in Tettnang, the study found.Beer-brewing in central Europe dates back thousands of years and is a cornerstone of the culture. People in the Czech Republic drink more beer than anywhere else in the world, according to a report from the Japanese beermaker Kirin. In Germany, where beer-making has been regulated for 500 years by a \u201cpurity law\u201d, the Oktoberfest welcomes 6 million beer-drinkers from across the world into its tents each year.Oktoberfest in Munich this year, where 6 million beer lovers are welcomed annually.

World leaders have promised to try to stop the planet heating by more than 1.5C above preindustrial levels by the end of the century, but are pumping out too much greenhouse gas to meet that target.The study found the alpha acid content of hops, which give beer its distinct aroma, had fallen in all regions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By 2050, they found, hop yields will fall 4.1-18.4% compared with the average from 1989-2018 if no measures are taken to adapt. The projected decline will be driven mainly by hotter weather and more frequent and severe droughts.Trnka said: \u201cGrowers of hops will have to go the extra mile to make sure they will get the same quality as today, which probably will mean a need for greater investment just to keep the current level of the product.\u201dAuernhammer said the climate threat to hops was important but added it was not the biggest factor in the price of a beer. High energy costs, driven by the soaring price of fossil gas since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, have played a bigger role for brewers. \u201cThe hops inside a beer do not cost as much as the cap on top of the bottle,\u201d he said.",

According to research by the environmental campaign group Feedback, if it led to just a 1% reduction in food waste, food businesses would save an estimated total of at least \u00a324.4m a year.Martin Bowman, senior policy and campaigns manager at Feedback, said this was \u201can immediately achievable goal\u201d that would \u201cmore than offset the costs of measurement and reporting, saving millions of pounds, and helping struggling families by lowering food inflation\u201d.\u201cAfter a decade of failed voluntary reporting, it is a dereliction of duty for the government to abandon this policy,\u201d he said. Campaigners say that the decision by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to backtrack on the legislation also risks exacerbating environmental challenges.Jamie Crummie, a co-founder of Too Good To Go, an app that connects customers to businesses with surplus unsold food, said: \u201cFood waste contributes 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions, surpassing the aviation industry\u2019s impact. As we are witnessing the devastating effect of climate change first-hand across Europe this summer, a decision like this from Defra feels particularly disheartening.\u201dThe government defended scrapping the legislation by claiming that the costs for businesses to regulate food waste reporting could drive food inflation. A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cA regulatory approach which we estimate to cost businesses around \u00a35.3m is not suitable in the current economic climate, especially when any additional costs may be passed on to consumers.\u201dInstead, they have suggested expanding the government-funded waste charity Wrap\u2019s specialist taskforce encouraging businesses to report voluntarily. However, Wrap has said there is a \u201cdisappointing\u201d lack of voluntary reporting by businesses, and that \u201cenhanced voluntary reporting\u201d would be more expensive than mandatory food waste reporting.The government\u2019s own impact assessment found that just a 0.25% reduction in food waste would balance out any costs of measuring and reporting it, with food waste measurement costing an estimated \u00a319 for each tonne measured, compared with between \u00a31,189 and \u00a33,099 of savings for each tonne of food waste reduced.Last summer, the government launched a consultation regarding the proposed law, in which 99% of respondents expressed support for the law, including 79% of retailers and 73% of hospitality services.Among thoseexpressing disappointment with the scrapping of the law are the retailers Tesco, Waitrose and Ocado. Tesco has said: \u201cPublishing food waste data is vital and must be mandatory if the UK is to achieve sustainable development goal 12.3 to halve food waste by 2030.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In the south-west Atlantic moratorium area, Oceana found there had been no fishing conducted by Chinese fleets in the same time period in 2019. Between 1,800 and 8,500 fishing hours were detected in the zone in each of the five years to 2019. In the eastern Pacific zone, China\u2019s fishing fleet appeared to fish only 38 hours in the year before the ban\u2019s introduction.Image from Oceana showing the Chinese fishing activity over consecutive years in one of the moratorium areas. Photograph: Oceana\u201cEnding squid fishing in areas where there is no fishing does nothing to protect squid,\u201d said Oceana\u2019s campaign director, Max Valentine.China is the largest producer of distant water fishing stock in the world, and the largest catcher of squid, according to a 2020 study. It is reportedly responsible for half of all high seas squid fishing. In the first six months of this year, China conducted more than 330,000 hours of squid fishing.\u201cI think moratoriums are really great \u2013 it\u2019s just like a marine protected area and stocks can rebound,\u201d said Valentine.\u201cUnfortunately with these particular bans, they\u2019re not in areas where crews particularly fish. We\u2019re not seeing [bans] off the coast of Argentina or Peru where the Chinese fleets have fished for over a decade.\u201dChinese authorities have said the moratorium areas are breeding grounds for squid, and bans will allow populations to rebound. However, Valentine said squid were highly migratory, and any areas purporting to protect breeding grounds would need to be much larger.In recent years China has announced a number of measures purported to control the level of fishing its fleet conducts, including announcing caps on fishing boats in Chinese waters in 2021, and in five squid fishing grounds across the Pacific and Indian oceans in 2022. Under the government\u2019s 13th five-year plan, spanning 2016 to 2020, China aimed to reduce its fishing fleet and total catch to 10m tonnes. The 14th plan aims to stick to the 10m tonnes cap, while continuing to reduce the number of large and medium-sized vessels.However, environmental groups have expressed scepticism over the effectiveness and transparency of China\u2019s efforts. A 2022 analysis of China\u2019s squid fishing industry within Chinese waters found its ocean haul fell briefly from 2018 to 2019, but has since continued to rise. Under-reporting of catches in international waters and suspected acts of illegal fishing are common.Oceana analysed automatic identification system (AIS) data from Global Fishing Watch (GFW), which relies on Chinese fishing vessels having the AIS tracking turned on and operating. In recent years there have been some major incidents of fishing vessels \u201cgoing dark\u201d, including within exclusive economic zone around the ecologically sensitive Galapagos Islands.There are widespread concerns about global overfishing, and issues with existing reporting mechanisms, including in the European Union.

As one study grimly noted: human noise may even be scrambling the eggs of baby fish.More remarkable still, even aquatic plants are highly sensitive to sound. Take, for example, marine seagrass. Just like terrestrial forests, seagrass is a carbon sink, contributing to stabilizing our global climate. Coasts were once abundant with seagrass meadows, which provide food and shelter for sea life, protect against erosion, enable nutrient cycling, stabilize the seafloor and filter pollutants. In the islands of the Pacific, seagrass meadows are both larder and pharmacy, hunting ground and healing space. The oldest known seagrass colony in the world (Posidoniaceae oceanica, off the Mediterranean coast of Ibiza) is over 100,000 years old, and quite possibly closer to 200,000 \u2013 which would make it the oldest living organism in the world.In the past few decades, seagrass meadows the size of the Amazon have vanished. Climate change, pollution, boat anchors and dredging, the building of seawalls and harbors, and hypersaline water from desalinization plants are all likely factors. As researchers at the Technical University of Catalonia have recently discovered, we can now add noise pollution to this list of threats. When the scientists exposed a sample of Mediterranean seagrass to seismic blast-level sound, the seagrass was severely damaged, as were the symbiotic fungi that help the plants absorb nutrients.Why would plants, without any apparent means of hearing, be sensitive to sound? Marine plants have organelles called amyloplasts, which help plants sense sound vibrations, and also store food, orient themselves to gravity and thus root themselves in the ocean floor. These tiny organelles are analogous to organelles found in octopuses and shrimp, called statocysts, which can sense even tiny sound vibrations in water. In octopuses, statocysts are grouped into lateral lines on their heads and arms. This explains how, even without ears, octopuses can locate prey or predators, particularly in low light conditions: they hear with their arms. Similarly, plants hear with their bodies.Their sensitive hearing is an advantage in the dark depths of the ocean, but it makes aquatic organisms very vulnerable. Loud underwater sounds can damage or destroy their hearing ability. These effects occur at much lower intensities of sound than are known to be damaging to terrestrial animals. By way of analogy: imagine a loud siren passing by. Now imagine that it renders you deaf; disrupts your digestion; and renders you so dizzy that you are unable to walk or tell which way is up. This is the fate of marine organisms in an increasingly noisy ocean: an onslaught of noise that stunts, harms and even kills.These findings underscore the vast threat that marine noise pollution poses to our oceans. As offshore operations \u2013 from seabed mining to oil and gas and renewable energy construction \u2013 are proliferating, little thought has been given to noise pollution. While exposure threshold levels have not yet been determined, it is clear that this emerging science will eventually lead to new restrictions on the permitting and operations of marine industrial and shipping activities.\nKaren Bakker is the director of the University of British Columbia\u2019s Program on Water Governance and the author of The Sounds of Life: How Digital Technology is Bringing Us Closer to the Worlds of Animals and Plants\nThis article was amended on 10 January 2023.

However, the tanker\u2019s cargo, of about 800,000 litres of industrial oil, has leaked, as has the fuel that was powering its engine. The oil has been detected in coastal waters near more than 60 villages, and sandy white beaches in several areas have been coated in foul-smelling sludge.The DENR said it would deploy a remotely operated vehicle to determine where the vessel is and to model the way in which oil is leaking. This process, however, will require favourable weather and currents.About 36,000 hectares (88,958 acres) of coral reef, mangroves and sea grass could be threatened by the oil spill, according to marine scientists at the University of the Philippines.The incident has also jeopardised the livelihoods of thousands of fishers, who have been forced to stay ashore because the waters are too dangerous, as well as the incomes of communities who depend on tourism.In Pola town, 14 people became ill with cramps, vomiting and dizziness after the spill, according to a report by the broadcaster ABS-CBN, which said officials were monitoring the air and water toxicity. A curfew has been imposed for people under the age of 21 in the town, and a state of calamity declared.The Oriental Mindoro governor, Humerlito Dolor, told a briefing on Monday that he would seek compensation for the damage and other expenses.\u201cLet me assure you, the damage done directly on the environment and on our people\u2019s livelihood will be given corresponding compensation depending on what is stipulated in the compensation guidelines,\u201d he said.The governor was speaking at a briefing with representatives of the tanker owner, RDC Reield Marine Services, and contractors hired for the cleanup operations.The tanker\u2019s owner has contracted two local agencies, Harbor Star Shipping Services and Malayan Towage and Salvage Corp, for the cleanup.Rodrigo Bella, vice-president of Harbor Star, said the weather conditions had made their work difficult. \u201cIf sea conditions are bad, it is also unsafe for our contractors to work,\u201d Bella said.The two contractors would shoulder all expenses initially, including paying residents hired for cleanup jobs, Dolor said.The national government has also pledged to hire locals under a scheme to assist those whose livelihood has been affected by temporary fishing and swimming bans in affected areas.",

Those who breach the conservation covenant agreements could be subject to fines.When the act became law, ministers lauded it as a benefit of post-Brexit Britain. Then environment secretary George Eustace declared: \u201cWe are setting an example for the rest of the world to follow.\u201dHowever, the government then missed its own legal deadline for setting what it termed as \u201cambitious\u201d Environment Act targets. When they did emerge, months late, conservation charities said the targets for nature, clean air and water were underwhelming and would not deliver the promised environmental benefits by 2030.In the letters, revealed on Saturday and sent in October 2019, Pow informs Charles: \u201cThis bill contains measures on conservation covenants which affect the interests of the crown, the Duchy of Lancaster and the Duchy of Cornwall. Part 7 (conservation covenants) of the bill applies to crown land as it applies to any other land.\u201dThese conservation covenants are new agreements between the government and landowners in certain biodiverse and nationally significant areas requiring the landowner not to undertake certain environmentally destructive or polluting activities.The letters show that the prince\u2019s private secretary, Clive Alderton, responded to Pow, giving his consent for the law, confirming that he was \u201ccontent with the bill\u201d.The Duchy of Cornwall brings in about \u00a321m a year for the duke and his family. Revenues from the estate are passed to the Prince of Wales, now Charles\u2019s son William, who uses them to fund his public, charitable and private activities. The duchy consists of approximately 53,000 hectares (130,000 acres) of land in 23 counties, mostly in south-west England, and in many areas of natural beauty and significance that are affected by environment targets.Charles has previously interfered in government affairs when it threatened to affect his businesses. Last year, the Guardian revealed that he exploited a controversial procedure to compel ministers in John Major\u2019s government in 1992 to secretly change a proposed law to benefit his landed estate.Under the procedure, the late Queen and her eldest son were given copies of draft laws in advance so they could examine whether the legislation affected their public powers or private assets, such as his Duchy of Cornwall estate or the privately owned estate at Sandringham. This procedure is different from the better-known royal assent \u2013 a formality that makes a bill become law.The Guardian\u2019s Queen\u2019s consent investigations found that procedure had been used by the late monarch in recent decades to privately lobby for changes. During her reign, ministers were required to secure approval from her or her son for more than 1,000 parliamentary acts before they were implemented. They include leasehold reform legislation that became law in 1993, when there was evidence of Charles applying pressure on elected ministers to ensure an exemption to prevent his own tenants from having the right to buy their own homes.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs declined to comment. Buckingham Palace has been contacted for comment.",

That\u2019s a major increase from the 14 such contracts signed in 2021.Fossil fuel companies won\u2019t save us from climate change. We need governments to step up | Adam MortonRead moreWhile price volatility for gas in Europe is already easing, most of the new contracts won\u2019t deliver gas until 2026 or later, after which they will lock in purchases for 20 years or more.\u201cLNG terminals are massively expensive, multi-decade investments,\u201d said Lukas Ross, a co-author of the report and program manager for Friends of the Earth. \u201cIn order for a bank or other investor to feel comfortable writing a check for something like this, they need market certainty. And the way that certainty is delivered is through long-term contracts. But a short-term supply crunch should not be solved with long-term infrastructure.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s the climate question. Taken together, the 2022 LNG contracts total 58.1m metric tons of LNG every year \u2013 that\u2019s more than half the gas burned for cooking and heating in US homes in 2021. These contracts represent 351m metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year, equivalent to the yearly emissions of 94 coal plants or one-third of all US households.\u201cHow many of these projects are built \u2013 and how many years of extraction and emissions are locked in \u2013 is perhaps the most urgent climate policy question in the US today,\u201d Ross said.The US government has fast-tracked the permitting process for several of the proposed LNG terminals, many of which had been stalled for years before the invasion of Ukraine. One terminal that Sempra Energy has been trying to build in Port Arthur, Texas, since 2019, for example, announced in January 2023 that it had secured contracts covering 80% of its output for the next 20 years, smoothing the path to construction.With European demand already drying up and EU leaders hesitant to sign long-term gas deals that conflict with their countries\u2019 climate commitments, some companies are now looking to increase exports to Asian markets instead. \u201cThere\u2019s somewhat of a bait and switch going on here,\u201d said Alan Zibel, research director for Public Citizen. \u201cThe public have been told that these terminals and these exports are to help Europe, but in reality, the bulk of the contracting volume is still going to Asia.\u201dCarbon capture project is \u2018Band-Aid\u2019 to greenwash $10bn LNG plant, locals sayRead moreOil and gas companies that have been trying to build export terminals on the Pacific coast for years to more easily reach customers in Asia have found a home in Mexico. Multiple projects are being built there, most of which will still go through US permitting processes because the gas they will be exporting will flow exclusively from the US.Meanwhile, US ratepayers are experiencing soaring prices at home.\u201cThe climate point is, of course, crucial and important, but this is also directly opposed to the interest of US consumers,\u201d Zibel said.His colleague Tyson Slocum testified on this point to Congress recently. \u201cNatural gas exports are directly responsible for Americans paying higher prices to heat and cool their homes,\u201d Slocum said. \u201cAmerican households, power producers and other consumers are now forced to directly compete with their counterparts in Berlin and Beijing, which has globalized domestic benchmark prices, exposing Americans to higher prices and increased volatility.

Most of Cystisoma\u2019s head is taken up by its eyes \u2013 all the better for seeing in the dark. \u201cThe bigger you make your eye, the more likely you are to catch any photons that are out there,\u201d says Karen Osborn, research scientist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC.Q&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world\u2019s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth \u2013 and how much there is to protect.\u00a0Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.A big challenge for animals living in deep midwater, in Cystisoma\u2019s case between 200 and 900 metres down, is to see while not being seen by predators. \u201cIt\u2019s basically like playing hide and seek on a football field,\u201d says Osborn. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to duck behind.\u201dEyes are especially hard to hide because retinas always have to contain dark, photon-absorbing pigments, which predators can either make out in the dim twilight zone illumination, or in the beams of their own bioluminescent searchlights. Cystisoma disguises its huge eyes in a unique way. Instead of concentrating the pigments in a small area, Osborn says, they spread their retina into a thin sheet of tiny reddish dots that are too small for most animals to see.Cystisoma hides most of the rest of its body by being completely transparent. When scientists catch them in trawl nets and empty them into a bucket of seawater, they appear as empty, palm-sized gaps between other animals. \u201cYou really cannot see these things until you pick them out of the water,\u201d says Osborn.Most of Cystisoma\u2019s internal organs appear crystal-clear thanks to the very orderly, structured way their tissues are arranged, Osborn explains. \u201cThe only thing they can\u2019t seem to do it very well with is their gut,\u201d she says. The golden structure visible beneath the eyes is the digestive organ. Even this is stacked tall and straight to cast as small a shadow as possible while Cystisoma hangs in its usual horizontal position.Most of Cystisoma\u2019s head is taken up by its enormous eyes. Photograph: KJ Osborn/SmithsonianThese crustaceans make themselves even harder to spot underwater by reducing the light that reflects off their transparent bodies, Osborn and colleagues discovered in 2016. Seen under an electron microscope, parts of Cystisoma\u2019s exoskeleton are covered in tiny protuberances, which Osborn likens to a shag-pile carpet. Other parts are covered in a single layer of spherical shapes, which the scientists think could be colonies of an unknown form of bacteria.The nanoscopic shag-pile carpet and spheres make light 100 times more likely to pass straight through Cystisoma, rather than reflect into the eye of a passing predator. \u201cIt works in exactly the same way as an anti-reflective coating on a camera lens,\u201d says Osborn.Discovered in the deep: the \u2018Elvis worms\u2019 that sparkle in the darknessRead moreCystisoma\u2019s legs in particular benefit from the anti-reflection shag-pile covering and sphere-covered joints, because otherwise they would easily catch the light as they flick and wriggle about. \u201cThese guys are absolute masters of transparent camouflage out in the midwater.\u201dBut what happens when the near-invisible Cystisoma actually wants to be found? These crustaceans need to pair up to reproduce. A clue as to how mates find each other is in the male Cystisoma\u2019s large antennae covered in structures that detect chemicals in the surrounding water. \u201cThey\u2019re actually smelling each other,\u201d says Osborn.",

But these two regulations, in the National Emission Ceilings Regulations 2018, are to be removed from UK law by the end of the year if the bill, which is going through the House of Lords, is approved.Katie Nield, a clean air lawyer for ClientEarth, said: \u201cThey are proposing to snip out some quite critical elements that are there to make sure the targets are actually met. They want to remove the legal duty on government to have a plan to reduce the emissions, to frequently revise that plan and to publish it, and they want to remove the need to put that out to public consultation.\u201cThe duty to produce a pathway to meet the targets is a critical tool to make sure the government explains what it is doing and to hold them to account. It raises major alarm bells. It is hard to see how this move could be anything other than a strategy to skirt accountability.\u201dThe government\u2019s pathway to reduce emissions had to be revised under the regulations this year because it was in breach of emission reduction targets for fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, which is classified as a cause of cancer. The pathway is also not on track to meet emissions reduction targets by 2030 for four out of the five air pollutants from transport, agriculture and industry \u2013 nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, PM2.5, ammonia and non-methane volatile organic compounds.Air pollution poses one of the greatest environmental risks to health, according to the World Health Organization, which estimates that in 2019 outdoor air pollution caused 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide\u201cThe fact that the government will no longer have to publish its plan, revise it and consult on it in the context of their current plan not on track to meet the targets, is really concerning,\u201d said Nield.More than half of the 600 laws set to be removed by the end of the year relate to the environment.Greener UK, a coalition of environmental groups including the RSPB, National Trust and Friends of the Earth, called on the government to remove at least two of the laws due to be chopped \u2013 relating to water and air quality.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

However, groundbreaking research has revealed that for most of their lives elephant seals sleep just two hours daily in a series of short naps while performing deep dives.The findings, revealed in the first study to record brain activity in a free-ranging, wild marine mammal, show that during the months they spend at sea, elephant seals rival the record for the least sleep among all mammals, currently held by African elephants. The seals were found to typically sleep in 10-minute bursts during deep, 30-minute dives, often spiralling downwards while dreaming, and occasionally lying down for a nap on the seafloor.\u201cFor years, one of the central questions about elephant seals has been when do they sleep,\u201d said Prof Daniel Costa, a marine ecologist at the University of California Santa Cruz and senior author. \u201cWe thought they must be sleeping during what we call drift dives, when they stop swimming and slowly sink, but we really didn\u2019t know.\u201dCosta\u2019s lab has been tracking elephant seals at the A\u00f1o Nuevo reserve for more than 25 years, using increasingly sophisticated tags to track the movements and diving behaviour of the seals during their foraging migrations, when they head out into the north Pacific Ocean for as long as eight months.\u201cNow we\u2019re finally able to say they\u2019re definitely sleeping during those dives, and we also found that they\u2019re not sleeping very much overall compared to other mammals,\u201d Costa added.The scientists believe that sleeping while diving allows the seals to avoid predation: they are most vulnerable to predators, including sharks and killer whales, while at the ocean surface, so they only spend a few minutes there to breath between dives.\u201cThey\u2019re able to hold their breath for a long time, so they can go into a deep slumber on these dives deep below the surface where it\u2019s safe,\u201d said Jessica Kendall-Bar, the paper\u2019s first author, who developed the system as a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz and who now works at UC San Diego.In the latest study, 13 young female seals were fitted with a neoprene headcap to secure sensors on the head that could reliably record brain waves in a scan known as an electroencephalogram or EEG. Time-depth recorders, accelerometers, and other instruments were also used to track the seals\u2019 movements.\u201cI spent a lot of time watching sleeping seals,\u201d Kendall-Bar said. \u201cOur team monitored instrumented seals to make sure they were able to reintegrate with the colony and were behaving naturally.\u201dThe recordings, collected from the seals during more than 100 dives, revealed that as they descended, seals entered a deep sleep stage known as slow-wave sleep while maintaining a controlled glide downward and then entered rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, when sleep paralysis causes them to turn upside down and drift downwards in a \u201csleep spiral\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Most of the world\u2019s new solar power was built in China, which installed more solar power last year than the entire world commissioned the year before, despite cutting subsidies in 2020 and 2021.Record rates of growth across Europe, the US and Brazil have put renewables on track to overtake coal as the largest source of global electricity generation by early 2025, the IEA said. By 2028, it forecasts renewable energy sources will account for more than 42% of global electricity generation.Tripling global renewable energy by the end of the decade to help cut carbon emissions is one of five main climate targets designed to prevent runaway global heating, alongside doubling energy efficiency, cutting methane emissions, transitioning away from fossil fuels, and scaling up financing for emerging and developing economies.Fatih Birol, the IEA\u2019s executive director, said: \u201cIt\u2019s excellent news to see the historical and spectacular growth of renewable energy.\u201d He added that while the report shows that global renewable capacity is already on course to increase by two-and-a-half times by 2030, it is not yet expected to reach the Cop28 goal of tripling renewables.\u201cWe\u2019re not there, but we\u2019re not a million miles away,\u201d Birol said. \u201cAnd governments have the tools needed to close the gap.\u201dBirol downplayed concerns that fast-rising costs facing wind developers in the US and Europe will be a drag on the industry\u2019s long-term growth.

The new estimate includes the birds that went extinct without the event being recorded \u2013 what scientists call a dark extinction.\u201cWe know we have lost iconic birds like the dodo, but we wanted to get a better estimate of the bird extinctions we didn\u2019t know about,\u201d said Dr Rob Cooke, an ecological modeller at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and the paper\u2019s lead author.To calculate the number of unknown extinctions, Cooke and his team extrapolated from the 640 bird species known to be extinct using a statistical model. The model used New Zealand as the baseline for bird species loss on the basis that the country had zero unknown extinctions.\u201cNew Zealand was the benchmark, it has the most complete bird record based on found fossils and bird observations, so that is the zero point, there is nothing unobserved in New Zealand.\u201dUsing the New Zealand data, the team created an estimate of how many species might have lived on an island. They then subtracted the number of known extinctions, and the remaining living birds. The result is the number of undiscovered extinctions.The study focused on island bird populations because non-migratory birds cannot easily disperse. \u201cIslands are the best place to study extinctions: 90% of extinctions are on islands, because island birds have nowhere else to go,\u201d Cooke said.Deforestation, overhunting, fires and invasive species are key causes of bird species loss, Cooke said.The team\u2019s new bird species extinction total of 1,430 may be on the low side, Cooke said. \u201cThe losses could be even higher, maybe up to 2,000, but we wanted to be conservative.\u201dMajor extinction events occurred in the 14th century, the paper found, when \u201cthe largest human-driven vertebrate extinction wave reported to date\u201d prompted species loss in the eastern Pacific at nearly 100 times the natural extinction rate. The extinctions were driven by human settlement, which brought deforestation and the introduction of invasive species.High numbers of bird extinctions, the paper says, are a loss for \u201cour understanding of avian species richness, ecological diversity and evolutionary history\u201d.\u201cThe world is emptier than we realise,\u201d Cooke said. \u201cAnd these missing birds are a loss to our imagination.\u201dAlso missing are the important roles these birds would have played in the wider environment. Birds play a vital role in Earth\u2019s ecosystems spreading seeds, pollinating plants, cleaning up carcasses and helping to fertilise coral reefs and the land with their droppings.Known bird species losses, the paper said, include \u201cextinct megaherbivores such as the elephant birds (Aepyornithidae) of Madagascar, which influenced plant structure and diversity and ecosystem dynamics, extinct aerial predators such as Haast\u2019s eagle (Hieraaetus moorei), and extinct seed-dispersers such as Seychelles parakeet (Psittacula wardi).\u201dKiller kitties: cats are eating 2,000 species, including hundreds that are at riskRead moreDr Alexander Lees, a reader in biodiversity at Manchester Metropolitan University, who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cThat the study convincingly shows we have mismeasured the avian extinction crisis does not surprise me at all. Most birds have very small bones and don\u2019t fossilise easily; many islands are not conducive to fossil formation; and in many places no one has looked for fossils at all.\u201dThe estimated bird extinction rate tallied with recent estimates of mollusc extinctions, he said, and was \u201ca useful way of approximating the extinction crisis and understanding what we have lost\u201d.Future extinctions, said Cooke, would continue if the world carried on as normal. Previous research by the same team of scientists suggests the world is at risk of losing another 669 to 738 bird species over the next few hundred years, with species facing increasing pressure from the climate crisis, diminished food sources and deforestation.\u201cRecent conservation has saved some species, and we must now increase efforts to protect birds with habitat restoration led by local communities,\u201d he said.

Smoked salmon pairs especially well with dill, black pepper, chives, soft cheese or creme fraiche, lemon, capers, spring greens, rye, and thinly sliced, crunchy veg (radish and cucumber, say), so bear that in mind when you come up with a dish to use up your own smoked salmon, should you be fortunate enough to have any left over. Here, I\u2019ve made a simple smoked salmon mousse from trimmings, which can be served on crackers, as a dip for crudites or, more elaborately, in today\u2019s cheesy gougeres.

It is likely that those corals which survived bleaching have been affected by reduced growth and reproduction.\u201dLast year\u2019s report said three years of relatively benign conditions produced record levels of coral cover in the reef\u2019s northern and central areas.That growth in corals was underpinned by a group of faster-growing coral species that also tend to be the most at risk from bleaching events.Dr Mike Emslie, who leads the long-term reef monitoring program at Aims, said there was an expectation the reef would have continued to recover, but the data showed otherwise.\u201cThis demonstrates that even less-severe bleaching events are enough to cause a pause in coral cover,\u201d he said.He said the recovery in recent years was \u201cdefinitely a good news story\u201d, but this \u201ccould turn around very quickly with another mass bleaching event, and there\u2019s still the risk from crown-of-thorns starfish and coral disease\u201d.When corals sit in unusually warm water for too long, they seperate from algae that live inside them.

Affected Diadema antillarum urchins lose their spines and suction, then succumb to disease.Elephant seals sleep for just two hours a day, deep dive research reveals Read moreThe researchers, from Tampa\u2019s University of South Florida (USF), also suspect the organism, a ciliate known as philaster, may have been responsible for wiping out about 98% of sea urchins in a similar episode in the region in the 1980s.\u201cI was like, \u2018Yes, we have to figure this out,\u2019 because in that 80s die-out, just the loss of this one species of urchin completely changed the fate of coral reefs,\u201d Mya Breitbart, professor of biological oceanography at USF, told the Tampa Bay Times of the day she was invited to research the die-off in March last year.Breitbart and a team including scientists from Cornell University and the US Geological Survey cracked the case within four months. Their study was published last week in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances.They identified the culprit by collecting samples from 23 sites around the Caribbean, including Aruba, the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and observing organisms attached to the sea urchins, which are known as the \u201clawnmowers\u201d of coral reefs for their ability to consume decay-causing algae.They were able to prove philaster was to blame by placing the organism in tanks with healthy, laboratory grown urchins and watching about 60% of the sample die with the same symptoms exhibited in the marine environment.Breitbart said what surprised them most was the speed at which they were able to home in on the prime suspect.\u201cAll of us on our team have been working on marine diseases for a long time, and this just doesn\u2019t happen. This is really unprecedented to figure it out,\u201d she said.The cause of the 1980s die-off was not established at the time and may never be known, Breitbart said, because no samples from that outbreak still exist.But the scientists did identify similarities between the two events, and say the outcome is the same: coral reefs clogged with algae and starved of nutrients, further adding to their precarious state.Reefs in the Caribbean were already suffering from the fast-spreading and highly contagious stony coral tissue loss disease, scientists warning more than a decade ago that the entire reef system was in danger of collapse.While there is no known method to eliminate philaster or protect sea urchins from it, Breitbart said, she was hopeful that further research would provide a breakthrough. Her team in Tampa has established a laboratory farm to study the organism, which is not harmful to humans.\u201cWe\u2019re excited to share this information with everyone, from reef managers to additional scientists so we can explore it further and try to stop its spread,\u201d she said.",

There are fears that gases have built up in the storage tanks, which means the ship could explode.Mark Lowcock, the UN humanitarian coordinator, told the UN security council last week an inspection team had again been refused permissions by Houthis to visit the ship moored several kilometres outside the Red Sea port of Ras Isa, north of Hodeidah.The two sides in the conflict in conversation with the UN blame each other for failing to reach a solution about what to do about the ship, and its valuable cargo.The Houthis want guarantees that they will be able to control the revenues from the oil on the ship valued at $80m (\u00a364m), a move that might require a new oil export mechanism.The UN-recognised Yemen government has warned in a letter to the UN of a \u201cbad and deteriorating situation\u201d that threatens an \u201cimminent environmental and humanitarian catastrophe in the Red Sea\u201d.It has also produced a video warning of an environmental disaster that could dwarf any previous oil spillage.Doug Weir, director of the Conflict and Environment Observatory, said the cause for concern was genuine. He told the Guardian: \u201cUntil a UN technical inspection takes place it is difficult to determine the precise risk that the vessel poses, however the potential for a serious environmental emergency is clear. An explosion leading to a spill would have a severe effect on the Red Sea marine environment, and on both biodiversity and livelihoods, an emergency made worse because the ongoing conflict would hamper efforts to control and respond to the pollution it would cause.\u201dThe ship itself, known as the Safer floating storage and offloading terminal, is a testament to a time when the Yemen economy was functioning. Owned by the Yemen oil company, Safer allows vessels to moor offshore and transfer oil extracted and processed from operations in the Marib oil field in central Yemen. The tanker contains 34 crude oil tanks of different sizes and volumes, amounting to a total capacity of around 3m barrels.In effect, a mini-oil export terminal, the ship has not been operational since March 2015 when the region fell under the control of the Houthi rebels.Built in Japan involving a single hull, experts say is likely to be at particular risk from corrosion and in spite of the production interruptions caused by the conflict, it is thought that it may still contain around 1.14m barrels of crude. The Yemen government points out this is four times the amount of oil released in the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, generally seen as as one of the worst man-made environmental disasters in history.An increasingly frustrated Lowcock told the UN security council last month \u201cIf the tanker ruptures or explodes, we could see the coastline polluted all along the Red Sea. Depending on the time of year and water currents, the spill could reach from Bab-el-Mandeb to the Suez Canal, and potentially as far as the strait of Hormuz,\u201d he added.The unavailability of diesel fuel has meant that Safer FSO\u2019s engines have not been started for several years, and the structure has been exposed to humidity and corrosion with little maintenance.With restricted water circulation, and delicate marine ecosystems, the Red Sea, home of corals and 600 species of fish and invertebrates, is seen as particularly vulnerable to oil pollution.",

You start throwing that into doubt, [and] it becomes a lot more complicated discussion.\u201dSunak\u2019s net zero U-turn is so toxic that it\u2019s united Greens and car manufacturers against him | Caroline LucasRead moreCiting several countries that have highlighted the availability of clean power to international businesses, the former Bank governor added: \u201cThe UK was in that camp, now it\u2019s blurred around it.\u201dSunak last month announced a U-turn on the government\u2019s climate commitments, including a decision to push back a 2030 deadline for the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2035. The prime minister also kickstarted a new round of North Sea drilling, pledging to \u201cmax out\u201d the UK\u2019s oil and gas reserves.Carney, who as the Bank\u2019s governor pushed to accelerate the decarbonisation of the global economy, called the decision \u201cdisappointing and mistaken\u201d, adding: \u201cIf you make a credible forward commitment \u2013 particularly with the market and businesses looking forward \u2013 they do most of the work for you. And then it\u2019s less of an issue.\u201cThere was very little weight, in my view, given to that decision. At least in any of the communication of that. And that\u2019s a challenge,\u201d he said..Pushing ahead with new oil and gas drilling risked creating a \u201cstranded asset problem\u201d in the UK energy sector, he warned, referring to the risk that the value of fossil fuel assets could fall rapidly.Highlighting forecasts from the International Energy Agency that global oil demand will peak this decade, Carney said: \u201cYou go back three, four years, and it was the 2030s. That\u2019s how much things have moved. That means we are going to have the stranded asset problem in the energy sector, and it\u2019s going to crystallise sooner than people think.\u201dDuring the online event, hosted by King\u2019s College London and the Fairness Foundation, Carney was challenged by Macpherson, who suggested Sunak\u2019s move brought the UK into line with the EU policy on the phasing out of internal combustion engine cars.However, Carney suggested the impact on business investment would come from the government chopping and changing its position. \u201cIt has, exactly [moved in line with the EU].

Community leaders estimate roughly 400 houses have been demolished, leaving families displaced or seeking shelter from recent rains in makeshift structures.\u201cWe are living in absolute fear,\u201d said Daniel Kobei, the executive director of the Ogiek Peoples\u2019 Development Program. \u201cThe first day they started bringing down houses using axes, hammers and pangas [machetes]. They brought down the school, and on the second day they even started burning some houses. Now, they have gone back with heavy machines to bring down houses that were not completely destroyed \u2026. They are really bringing down everything.\u201dCommunity leaders fear that houses of cultural significance may be destroyed. \u201cThis kind of destruction can bring the extinction of a community,\u201d said Kobei.The community has faced systemic evictions from the Mau forest \u2013 Kenya\u2019s largest water tower \u2013 for decades. After a prolonged court battle between the Ogiek and the Kenyan government, the African court on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights found in 2017 that the Ogiek had ancestral land rights to the Mau forest and could rightfully occupy it. In a 2022 reparations judgment, the court ordered the Kenyan government to delimit, demarcate and offer the Ogiek titles to the territory they traditionally lived in.Rights groups and Ogiek leaders said the government\u2019s implementation of the landmark judgments had been slow and left them open to continuing violations.The recent slate of Ogiek evictions in the Sasimwani and Nkareta areas of the forest follows directives by the Kenyan president, William Ruto, last month ordering security agencies to remove illegal settlers. Protecting Mau forest resources was necessary to fight the climate crisis, Ruto said, and any illegal settlers removed would be allocated land.Authorities have long maintained that evictions are necessary to protect the Mau ecosystem from heavy deforestation caused by illegal logging and the clearing of land for farming. They have also argued that the encroachment puts at risk important water resources that millions of Kenyans rely on.\u201cThe concerns are valid, but it does not mean that conservation cannot coexist with human rights,\u201d said Maweu. \u201cIt\u2019s about looking for a human-rights-based approach to conservation. It does not have to be exclusionary.\u201dSome of those settled in parts of the forest have titles to land in the Mau forest, the validity of which are contested. Competing claims complicate the long-running dispute, rights groups say, and indiscriminate evictions are affecting the Ogiek communities\u2019 land rights.Roughly 400 houses have been demolished by rangers from Kenya\u2019s wildlife and forest services. Photograph: Courtesy of OPDPIn a statement this week, Kenya\u2019s national rights commission said it was \u201cperturbed\u201d by the ongoing evictions, which were being done \u201cwithout the prior profiling and identification of genuine forest dwelling communities\u201d.Investigation launched into killings and evictions on World Bank tourism projectRead moreRights NGOs and Ogiek leaders also said that the government skipped proper eviction procedures, including giving notice to communities and resettlement plans. \u201cThe way that the evictions are being done violates Kenyan and international laws,\u201d said Otsieno Namwaya, east Africa director at Human Rights Watch.Ogiek community leaders said the recent wave of evictions was an unexpected turnaround, after what they claimed were \u201cpromising\u201d meetings with environmental officials this year on steps to implement the African court judgment.The Ministry of Environment did not respond to requests for comment.Rights groups have said lasting solutions to the ongoing evictions are \u201curgently needed\u201d. \u201cUnless we get to a point where the issue is sustainably resolved, it is likely to recur in the future,\u201d said Maweu.",

Finding the answer has never been more pressing | Andrew MeijersRead moreA concluding conference statement said the Southern Ocean was undergoing \u201ccritical changes\u201d seen in record low levels of sea-ice, record high temperatures and \u201cdramatic\u201d shifts in penguin populations.\u201cThe chronic lack of observations for the Southern Ocean challenges our ability to detect and assess the consequences of change,\u201d the statement said.The sea ice around Antarctica has been at its lowest levels on record for the past two southern hemisphere summers.As the region approached the peak of winter this week, satellite data showed there was about 2.5m sq km less ice than the long term average. Scientists have said the dramatic loss of ice this winter is unprecedented.\u201cWe were completely unprepared for this and it was entirely unexpected, and that\u2019s due to a deficit in our observing system,\u201d said Dr Andrew Meijers, an oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey.Global climate models struggled to reproduce changes in the Southern Ocean, he said, and that was down to a lack of data.While satellites were good at recording how much ice was covering the ocean, there was very little known about the thickness of the ice or of changes beneath it.\u201cGlobal warming is really ocean warming, and the Southern Ocean controls the rate of melt of the Antarctic ice sheet, which is the single greatest uncertainty in projecting future sea level rise,\u201d he said.Antarctica\u2019s ecosystems were strongly tied to the growth of phytoplankton and krill, which were themselves linked to the annual cycles of sea ice, Meijers said.Antarctic scientists warned earlier this month the number of extreme events on and around the continent \u2013 from the loss of sea ice to melting ice sheets and heatwaves \u2013 would almost certainly get worse as the planet continued to warm.Scientists found this year that a deep Antarctic ocean current that transports nutrients around the globe and influences the climate has slowed by about 30% since the 1990s. A separate study found the slowdown, blamed on increased melting of ice on Antarctica, was likely to intensify in coming decades.Australian climate science projects in Antarctica put on ice due to budget cutsRead moreDr Sian Henley, co-chair of Soos and a marine scientist at the University of Edinburgh, said the Southern Ocean had a \u201cdisproportionate\u201d role in the world\u2019s climate system.The world\u2019s oceans have taken up about 90% of the extra heat being retained by the planet, caused mostly by humans burning fossil fuels and clearing forests. About 75% of that heat uptake happened in the Southern Ocean, Henley said.Oceans also absorb about 30% of the extra CO2 from human activities, and about 40% of that ocean uptake takes place in the Southern Ocean.Henley said: \u201cIf you look at the coverage of the global ocean, observations have increased. But the Southern Ocean is still a data desert. There\u2019s a chronic shortage of data to address some of the most pressing questions.\u201cIt\u2019s now crystal clear that sea ice in the Antarctic is in peril and that puts its role in the climate system also under pressure.\u201dAlso at the conference was Dr Ken Johnson, an ocean chemist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute who leads a project deploying hundreds of ocean floats with sensors measuring temperature, salinity, oxygen levels, pH and nitrate levels.\u201cThe Southern Ocean is the engine of the climate on Earth. At a time when we need to be measuring it more, we\u2019re monitoring it less,\u201d Johnson said.He said the number of observations from sensors on board freight ships had been declining, and thousands of kilometres of ocean often went unmonitored, particularly through the southern hemisphere winter.",

But critics say the traps cause animals immense suffering, and that non-target species are regularly caught.The Welsh government\u2019s agriculture (Wales) bill, which looks likely to pass in the next few weeks, will make the use of snares in Wales an offence carrying a potential six-month jail sentence or an unlimited fine.Late on Tuesday, members of the Senedd voted down Conservative amendments to the bill that opponents said would have have been a back door for continued use of snares.Will Morton, the League Against Cruel Sports\u2019 head of public affairs, said: \u201cWales is leading the way in animal welfare by being the first country to ban these cruel and indiscriminate traps. We thank the thousands of campaigners who are backing the ban in Wales and the MSs who gave cross party support to make it become a reality.\u201dAccording to 2012 research by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), up to 250,000 snares lie hidden in undergrowth of England and Wales. The wire nooses catch animals around the neck, pinning them in place.According to existing regulations, snare operators must return to check on them at least once a day, while voluntary codes of best practice recommend twice a day, particularly at dawn as most animals are caught at night.But opponents say that in practice trapped animals can suffer for hours or days, vulnerable to other animals, before they are shot or slowly die. The traps themselves can be lethal, with wire nooses that tighten the more an animal struggles to free itself.Snare operators predominantly use them to catch foxes, with a smaller number used for hunting rabbits. But Defra\u2019s research found badgers, hares, otters, deer and even domestic dogs and cats were also often caught.Polling carried out by YouGov in January 2021 showed 78% of the Welsh public wanted snares to be made illegal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The departmental council said there had been three years of low yields.\u201cIn 2023, poor flowering is primarily linked to the hot weather and the absence of rainfall for over a month. No area is suitable for picking under current harvesting rules, which require sufficient flowering density,\u201d it said.The Vosges mountains normally provide three-quarters of France\u2019s wild harvest of this flower, valued for its anti-inflammatory properties and used to produce capsules, oil, gel and cream.As part of an awareness campaign in the Savoie, leaflets are being distributed to remind visitors of the various restrictions in Alpine sites.

Our supporters are doing what the suffragettes did and what the civil rights movements did.

It is an act of self-respect, an act of solidarity, an act of necessity.It matters little what changes legislators make to the laws on peaceful protest or how strongly the police enforce those laws. Just Stop Oil supporters understand that this is irrelevant when set against the future that runaway climate breakdown entails.The government can arrest, fine or incarcerate ordinary people for making their voices heard, or it can take meaningful steps to protect the people of this country by stopping the development of new sources of oil and gas, insulating people\u2019s homes and defending the NHS.This latest clampdown is not going to deter us: if anything, it\u2019ll have the opposite effect.

        "text": "Your interview with Tony Juniper raises two important points about why current government policies are neither solving the housing crisis nor effectively safeguarding countryside in the green belt for future generations (England\u2019s nature chief calls for building on green belt to solve housing crisis, 18 November).Building in harmony with nature should be supported. But the new homes being built are doing little to address the housing crisis. Targeting the countryside for expensive, executive homes is wrong and counterproductive.Around 5% of all new housing is built on land that is current or former greenfield land in the green belt. But only about 5% of this is social housing and consistently less low-cost housing overall is delivered in new developments \u2013 whether in the green belt or elsewhere \u2013 than local councils think is needed.Second, only 28% of all farmland in England\u2019s green belts is covered by the environmental improvement schemes that Natural England administers, compared with 42% of all farmland in England. That\u2019s why we should aim to improve the green belt through a cross-government land use strategy for England.Paul MinerHead of policy and planning, CPRE, the Countryside Charity Tony Juniper\u2019s suggestion that \u201cbuilding on the green belt should be part of the UK\u2019s answer to the\u00a0housing crisis\u201d may be right. More homes will help ease demand wherever you build them. But where we build them matters. If we construct thousands of homes in the green belt \u2013 around the peripheries of towns and cities \u2013 and don\u2019t connect them with reliable and affordable public transport networks, then we are not\u00a0encouraging people to use public transport.There are 33m cars on the road today, accounting for about 15% of the UK\u2019s annual carbon emissions. We know that busy roads divide communities, roadside emissions cause death and disease, and car\u2011congested urban centres drag down wellbeing and mental health.It\u2019s time we began reconfiguring our cities to benefit the people who\u00a0live there. Birmingham unveiled its \u201cgreen ring\u201d initiative this year, and dozens of towns and cities are exploring concepts such as \u201cwalking neighbourhoods\u201d.If we build homes on the green belt, we\u2019re doing our towns and cities a disservice by evacuating people to the peripheries and asking them to drive everywhere. Let\u2019s create new homes where people need them most within our urban centres, and take advantage of the public transport networks, infrastructure and amenities already in place.Tom SlaterFounding director, T2S Architecture Tony Juniper\u2019s proposal sounds quite plausible in the way he suggests combining an improvement of urban green space with the protection of wildlife habitats. The big caveat, however, is that with a barely regulated construction industry bent on profit at any price, such a sensitive approach to development and land usage could never be delivered. Without a government that ensures land ceases to be a means of profitable speculation, taking up Juniper\u2019s suggestion would only be\u00a0a recipe for disaster. It would result in ever more shoddy housing swamping our already overstressed green spaces. Only a radical national policy to develop equitable land usage, giving equal weight to housing needs and environmental concerns could begin to address the housing crisis.John GreenLondon Tony Juniper misunderstands the fundamental purpose of green belts. They were introduced to prevent the coalescence of towns and cities, thereby avoiding the repetition of the vast conurbations that emerged at the time of the Industrial Revolution and thereafter; environmental and nature protection were secondary\u00a0concerns.This is why the new towns in south-east England were developed beyond the green belt to prevent the continued urban sprawl of London, which would have solved neither housing or social problems, nor adequately protected the natural environment.Bill and Penny Boydell Painswick, Gloucestershire  Do you have a photograph you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

There\u2019s no way we can stop pollution overnight. If there were, I would do it without hesitation.\u201dCoffey took a veiled swipe at the Labour party, which has vowed to \u201cend the Tory sewage scandal\u201d, by saying that those who say they could end the problem are \u201ceither detached from reality or being definitively dishonest with the public\u201d.Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey: \u2018There\u2019s no way we can stop pollution overnight.\u2019 Photograph: Jacob King/PAShe also claimed \u201creaching the gold standard for ecological status would mean taking us back to the natural state of our rivers from the year 1840\u201d, which was \u201cnot practical or desirable\u201d. As an illustration of the difficulties, she pointed out that \u201cno one is contemplating ripping up half of Sheffield to let the River Don run free, but without that it would never be scored as gold standard\u201d.Her plan has been criticised for including measures such as a ban on plastic in wet wipes that were announced years ago. Meanwhile, critics say they cannot see the tough new actions needed to tackle the crisis. The environment secretary recently faced calls by campaigners and political parties to resign for \u201cnot caring\u201d about the sewage scandal, and the Conservative party is concerned that anger over local pollution issues may cost seats in the upcoming local elections. Coffey was recently named the least popular cabinet minister \u2013 by some margin \u2013 among Tory voters in a Conservative Home poll.This week it was revealed that even England\u2019s most celebrated beaches are being marred by sewage, with Blue Flag areas in Sussex and Devon having experienced 8,500 hours of dumping last year.\u2018This is bigger than potholes\u2019: Lib Dems tap into voter anger over sewageRead moreThe strategy also focuses on getting people to use less water, encouraging the rollout of smart meters and a campaign for a change in lifestyle choices.When asked by journalists how she personally reduced her own water usage, Coffey said she had a meter that once detected a leak. The water minister, Rebecca Pow, said she had just installed her third water butt.The Liberal Democrats\u2019 environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, said: \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey is throwing in the towel in the fight to protect our rivers from filthy sewage dumping. This is a complete abdication of duty.\u201cThe Conservatives are responsible for this sewage crisis after allowing water companies to dump sewage in our rivers for years. They need to take responsibility for fixing it. The public shouldn\u2019t be forced to pay the price with our rivers and coasts ruined for generations to come.\u201dCampaigners said her plans did not go far enough to protect rivers and wildlife.Matt Browne, the head of policy and advocacy at Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: \u201cWhat we are still waiting to see is a comprehensive plan built around delivering on a long-term target for the health of our waters and an ambitious UK chemicals strategy to weave these individual threads into a world-leading tapestry of action to restore our rivers and seas. With so much of our wildlife and waters struggling under the weight of pollution, development and overuse, only a well-focused, well-resourced and far-reaching plan will turn the tide for nature.\u201d",

The money could come from carbon markets, wealthy governments and philanthropists, but there must also be urgent actions such as a ban on clearing forests, developing businesses that rely on standing forests and reducing demand for commodities linked to deforestation, such as palm oil, soya, beef and cocoa.Lord Turner, a former head of the CBI and ex-chair of the UK government\u2019s Committee on Climate Change, who now chairs the Energy Transitions Commission, said governments should not delude themselves about the scale of the challenge.\u201cAs long as the world consumes more red meat, there will be an incentive to deforest more areas of tropical rainforest. If we have that $130bn coming forward, it could make a material difference. But it would not put a total or permanent stop to it. The danger would be that it would come back in future years,\u201d Turner said.\u201cThis is an area where robust quantification of what you spend and what you get is much more difficult than anywhere else. When we work out how much to spend to decarbonise the electricity system, we can come up with a figure. [With deforestation], there is extreme uncertainty. If you really wanted to spend your way to turning off the deforestation, with a trillion a year you\u2019d probably do it. If you\u2019ve allocated $10bn, which is the kind of figure that comes out of the G7, don\u2019t fool yourself,\u201d he said.Cattle in Chaco province, Argentina \u2026 reducing demand for beef is a vital element in reversing deforestation.

Hurricane Hilary, with maximum sustained winds of 130mph (210km/h) and a central air pressure of 943mb, advanced towards the Baja California peninsula this weekend as a category 4 hurricane, before weakening and arriving as a tropical storm in southern California late on Sunday.Tropical storms are less strong than hurricanes and have maximum sustained winds below 74mph, while hurricanes are at or above this speed. The last time a tropical storm made landfall in southern California was in 1939, when it flooded Los Angeles and killed nearly 100 people.Hilary triggered California\u2019s first ever tropical storm warning, extending from the Mexican border to just north of Los Angeles amid rainfall totals estimated to have reached 70-150mm (3-6in) across southern California. This amount of rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening flooding, and would amount to more than a year\u2019s worth of rain across parts of California and Nevada.00:01:12\"I've never seen anything like this\": Tropical Storm Hilary brings deluge to desert \u2013 videoJoe Biden announced last week that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had positional personnel and supplies to respond across the region, and the Mexican army deployed nearly 14,000 soldiers to the city of Mexicali and the states of Baja California Sur, Jalisco and Colima.Hilary will gradually weaken into a depression as it progresses north-northwestwards through California, Nevada, Oregon and Idaho during the early part of this week, although still bringing heavy rain to these parts. Central and south-west Idaho usually only have about 15mm of rainfall for August, but could receive cumulative totals of 30-50mm through the next few days.Meanwhile, large parts of the midwest and the central and southern plains of the US have been put under excessive heat warning going into this week as temperatures continue to soar 5-10C above the climatological average. Last Friday, more than 65 million people were put under these heat alerts, with many warnings extending into Friday or Saturday this week. Widespread temperatures over 38C (100F) are probable through this week but with peak temperatures reaching the low to mid-40Cs (104-112F) in places.In Europe, more heat will be moving up from northern Africa this week. Spain and Portugal will be most affected, with south-west Spain and southern Portugal seeing temperatures reaching the low 40Cs. Parts of Italy and southern France can also expect temperatures of about 40C. However, this heat should subside as low pressure brings cooler westerly winds towards this weekend.00:01:42Storm Hilary: flooding and mudslides triggered in California \u2013 video This article was amended on 22 August 2023.

They sit outside honeybee hives and capture bees as they enter and exit. They chop up the smaller insects and feed the thoraxes to their young.The Asian hornets first came to Europe in 2004 when they were spotted in France, and it is thought they were accidentally transported in cargo from Asia. They rapidly spread across western Europe and have crossed the Channel to Britain, probably also in cargo.Once they establish permanent populations they are almost impossible to stop, so the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in the UK has launched an eradication campaign, destroying any nests and capturing individuals.Prof Juliet Osborne, the chair in applied ecology at the University of Exeter, said: \u201cThis year has certainly seen quite an increase in the number of Asian hornet nests found in the south-east of England.\u201cIt is no great surprise, because this species is spreading rapidly through Europe and can cause real damage to honeybee colonies as they predate on the bees at the entrance to hives. They also eat a wide range of other insects, so their gradual spread across Europe may well affect other wild species as well as the managed honeybee.\u201cWe have developed a method for radio-tracking the hornets so that they can be followed back to their nest to help with control efforts. We are also working on an automated monitor, using artificial intelligence to detect and identify Asian hornets in the future, making it much easier to monitor their spread.\u201dDefra\u2019s chief plant and bee health officer, Nicola Spence, said: \u201cBy ensuring we are alerted to possible sightings as early as possible, we can take swift and effective action to stamp out the threat posed by Asian hornets.

This, he said, could be fixed with interventions to boost pollinators.The study notes that bees and hoverflies are the main pollinators of apples, and are \u201cessential\u201d for global production of apples, one of the world\u2019s most important fruit crops. The study says \u201cdirect links between insect pollination and apple quality are equivocal\u201d, with specific mention of the number of seeds, size (which affects their marketability) and calcium levels.Potts said there was minimal data on pollinator trends in the countries from where the UK imports many of its fruits and vegetables. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a challenge at home, absolutely ... but we have almost no data on the status and trends of pollinators and other beneficial insects in those countries that produce a huge amount of fruit and veg that comes to the UK. That, in terms of policy and practice, is a huge challenge.\u201dHe added: \u201cMany of our crops \u2013 mangoes, raspberries, strawberries \u2013 are coming in from north Africa, Europe or South America. We are quite vulnerable, not only at home but also overseas.\u201dInsect pollination contributes more than \u00a3600m to the UK economy every year. More than 75% of all food crops require pollination, and declines have serious implications for global food security. The drivers of insect loss vary, but almost certainly include loss of habitat (driven by the expansion of agricultural land), exposure to pesticides and climate breakdown.Research published this week revealed that conservation measures over the past 30 years have failed to stop the decline of insects on British farmland. Potts encouraged MPs to push for a new biodiverse and sustainable farming system, which he said could be be done through farming policy by way of environment land management schemes, as well as local nature recovery strategies and biodiversity net gain (BNG), both of which could include policies around insects.Prof Dave Goulson from the University of Sussex, who was giving evidence alongside Potts, said: \u201cInsects are quite adaptable, and they\u2019ve been around for 480m years and survived all the mass extinction events that have gone before. But, simultaneously, if their home is destroyed, there\u2019s nowhere to nest, they can\u2019t find anything to eat \u2026 When you put it all together, then we shouldn\u2019t really be surprised that they\u2019re struggling to cope.\u201dMore wildlife-friendly farming needed to stop decline of insects in Britain, says reportRead moreHe reiterated the need to improve the way we farm. \u201cSeventy per cent of Britain, roughly, is farmland, and there is pretty clear evidence that the way farming has changed is the biggest driver of biodiversity declines.

This is likely to be based on the Universal Declaration of River Rights, which says rivers should have the right to flow, perform essential functions within the river\u2019s ecosystem, be free from pollution, feed and be fed by sustainable aquifers and have native biodiversity, as well as the right to regeneration and restoration.The Ouse, like many other rivers around the country, gets filled with effluent and wastewater when sewage treatment plants along its route cannot cope with heavy rain. In 2019, every river in England failed to meet quality tests for pollution.The move to grant the River Ouse rights was spearheaded by Matthew Bird, a Lewes town and district councillor. He told the Guardian he had become increasingly frustrated with the framing of discourse around water pollution. \u201cThe water companies are not taking their responsibilities seriously; there\u2019s a policy vacuum at government level, and the Environment Agency, who are the river\u2019s legal protectors, are not protecting it. At the same time, local communities feel powerless and vent frustrations in protest or take part in sporadic orchestrated meetings with Southern Water with no action followed up.\u201dLaws of nature: could UK rivers be given the same rights as people?Read moreThe council had already passed two earlier motions highlighting clear evidence that water quality had deteriorated due to sewage pollution and recognising its obligation to protect local rivers. Bird said this was a response to growing public concerns for the health and wellbeing of water bodies and a determination to hold companies to account.Attempts to give part of the River Frome in Somerset legal rights failed in 2020, prompting Bird to seek a new approach. After a mapping exercise held during a popular river festival, and with support from the Environmental Law Foundation and other experts, he drafted a motion he hoped would bring the whole community and a neighbouring local authority on board.Despite initial opposition, Bird said an \u201cimpassioned speech\u201d by a Conservative councillor in favour of the motion convinced most to vote for it. \u201cThat was quite amazing, and good to think that feelings towards the river can be stronger than politics,\u201d he said.Work on the charter will involve local people and environmental groups and will be discussed at the next catchment partnership meeting of organisations involved in protecting the water environment. Bird said there are still many unanswered questions about how the rights will work in practice. \u201cBut that\u2019s fine. We have two years to work out an answer,\u201d he said.The motion was supported by local organisations including the Ouse and Adur Rivers Trust and the Sussex Wildlife Trust.Laws giving natural features such as rivers and mountains, or ecosystems, legal rights have been enacted around the world, from Ecuador to New Zealand.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

        "text": "Rishi Sunak\u2019s Friday morning was probably ruined by the furious resignation letter he received from Zac Goldsmith, in which the Tory peer accused the prime minister of being apathetic about the environment and a failure on climate policy. But was Goldsmith right?It appears so. While it would be difficult to accuse Sunak of being a climate denier, the evidence suggests he does not care about the subject, which has resulted in a lack of climate action and risks the UK helping push the planet towards an uninhabitable condition.Though the prime minister is always keen to regale audiences with how his young daughters are champions for the environment, he is certainly not one. When he was chancellor, ministers in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Foreign Office frequently described him as a \u201cblock\u201d on funding for climate and nature, and said that at the cabinet table he argued for trade deals with countries that had lower environmental standards, rather than using Britain\u2019s power on the world stage to push for change.Critics are keen to point out Sunak refused to sign a foreword to the Dasgupta report, a review of the value of biodiversity. This review, by the respected professor Sir Partha Dasgupta, was welcomed across the board, even by the former chancellor Sajid Javid, despite Sunak appearing unimpressed by its findings.Still, people can learn, and in his role as prime minister Sunak has had access to all the best experts and evidence available on climate. He was given a major opportunity to stand on the world stage as the UK\u2019s new prime minister at the UN\u2019s Cop27 climate summit last year, but he flip-flopped on attending, and only flew out to Egypt at the last minute, giving the audience a policy-free speech about how his children care about the environment.Since then, things have gone downhill. His government failed to include environmental protections in the retained EU law bill, which will scrap many EU regulations that protect the environment in the UK. Sunak\u2019s government has also committed to extracting more polluting fossil fuels, from the Cumbria coalmine to the Rosebank oilfield.And under his leadership, the energy department has spent far more time attacking the Labour party for taking donations from a funder of the protest group Just Stop Oil than it has championing the net zero by 2050 target enshrined in law by Sunak\u2019s predecessors.Just look at this week\u2019s Climate change committee report. The UK was not perfect on climate policy under Boris Johnson, but the committee, chaired by a Conservative MP, found the country had regressed further over the past year.It said the country had failed on insulation, with fewer homes protected under government-backed schemes than last year; that there had been little progress on transport emissions; there was no programme for behaviour change; and wind and solar farms were being installed at a snail\u2019s pace. The committee specifically blamed a failure of political leadership for the stalled progress.Lord Deben, the outgoing chair of the committee, said its confidence that the government would meet its shorter-term carbon-cutting goals by 2030 was even lower than last year, despite the publication of a new green strategy by ministers. \u201cWe\u2019ve slipped behind, and other people have moved ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a report that suggests satisfactory progress.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Although he got a dog for his daughters and takes it on the occasional photo opportunity, he allowed the Defra minister Mark Spencer, who is cosy with the farming and hunting lobbies, to scrap the kept animals bill, a decision that Labour and the Lib Dems are looking to exploit and which is likely to allow animal cruelty to continue for years to come.In his resignation letter, Goldsmith wrote: \u201cThe problem is not that the government is hostile to the environment, it is that you, our prime minister, are simply uninterested.\u201d It is hard to disagree. Unless Sunak has a swift and significant change of heart, he is likely to be remembered for allowing the UK to lose its role at the forefront of the climate fight.",

It shows the agricultural heartland of Mato Grosso, where crops are already suffering from drought and extreme heat, would be just over half a degree celsius hotter by 2050 if deforestation continued at the rapid rate of recent years.The paper, published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrated Amazon deforestation causes warming at distances up to 60 miles (100km) away. The greater the forest clearance, the higher the temperature. This is in addition to the wider climate impact of global heating.\u2018Our world hangs by a thread\u2019: Indigenous activist asks US agri giant to stop destroying Amazon rainforestRead moreDominick Spracklen of the University of Leeds said the average tree had a cooling effect equivalent to two to three 2.5kW air conditioners working at full power every hour of every day. This works through evapotranspiration, which he said was very similar to the sweat humans produce to lower body temperature. He said the effect spread wider than anyone had realised.\u201cWe always thought this might be happening, but the extent is bigger than I would have thought,\u201d he said. \u201cMore and more, we are demonstrating the big benefits the forests bring to surrounding regions. For farmers, they bring cooler air and more rainfall. Hopefully putting numbers on these benefits will help to persuade a broader set of people to protect forest areas.\u201dAn increasing number of peer-reviewed studies are proving the importance of the Amazon in maintaining a stable regional climate. Earlier this year, a paper showed that forest clearance reduced rainfall up to 125 miles away. More recently, research at a greater scale demonstrated that the Amazon was coupled with the South American monsoon and that continued deforestation could reduce regional precipitation by 30% with dire consequences for food production.Until now, studies on the impact of forest clearance on heat have concentrated on local effects with a clear correlation between loss of tree cover and higher temperatures in the area where the trees were cut down. The new research went further by looking at whether there is also a warming effect over a wider area. Using satellite data and artificial intelligence, the authors found a 0.7C increase in temperature for each 10-percentage point loss of forest within a radius of 60 miles.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

As the paper concludes: \u201cWe show that regional forest loss increases warming by more than a factor of four with serious consequences for the remaining Amazon forest and the people living there.\u201dHowever, the lead author, Ed Butt, said this should be seen not as an alarm, but as a useful tool to incentivise the sustainable management of the forest. \u201dIf we could reduce deforestation, then we could avert a good amount of regional warming. I see that as a big opportunity. It demonstrates the big benefit of reducing deforestation for local farmers \u2026 The most important thing is that states like Mato Grosso can follow different futures. This hands back control to regions and states. They could really reduce the amount of warming they will be exposed to.\u201d",

The rules also stated that hedgerows were not cut between 1 March and 31 August without good cause, because this is when birds nest in them.In advance of these payments being phased out \u2013 farmers are getting less of the BPS money every year and instead have the chance to \u201ctop up\u201d with new environmental land-management payments \u2013 the government is dropping all these requirements at the end of the year.The RSPB has called for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to keep the hedge protections, or replace them with another hedge-protecting policy.Alice Groom, the head of sustainable land use policy at the charity, said: \u201cThe future of over 547,000km of hedgerow alongside agricultural land is now under threat. As spaces for wildlife we believe hedgerows are an essential part of creating a vibrant countryside and should be recognised as part of the effort to halt species decline in England, as well as helping to keep carbon locked up.\u201cSo we are asking Defra to commit to the protection of our precious hedgerows and ensure that they continue to have the basic protections as afforded under the basic payments scheme.\u201dOther charities have criticised the lack of care for hedges. Tom Fyans, the director of campaigns and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, said: \u201cIt\u2019s simply not good enough. The anger levels of farmers and land managers trying their best to look after our environment are rising fast because the government is increasingly seen as a hindrance rather than a help.\u201cDefra has been widely criticised for its lack of ambition when it comes to protections for nature. Worse, it now looks like even the insufficient protections we do have are going to be lost through sheer carelessness.\u201cThere was genuine goodwill back in January when the government announced plans to plant 30,000 miles of new hedgerows. Ministers are in danger of squandering this positive momentum because, despite setting hedgerow targets, there is so far no policy that might actually ensure they are hit.\u201cNow we find out one of the few protections hedgerows do enjoy is about to become null and void.\u201dFarmers have also complained and urged the government to act.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, who was energy secretary when the government negotiated the subsidy deal, said: \u201cIt looks like they are acting in bad faith.\u201dUnder the terms of the subsidy contract, which has handed Drax about \u00a31.4bn to date, energy projects receive a fixed price for each megawatt of electricity generated.Usually companies receive a payment levied on energy bills which tops up the earnings from the wholesale market to the agreed \u201cstrike price\u201d. But in the past year market prices have been significantly higher than the subsidy level, requiring companies to pay the difference back to consumers.Drax has denied that it intentionally shut its biomass unit to avoid making these payments in favour of profiting from the resale price of its wood pellets, branding Bloomberg\u2019s investigation \u201cfalse, inaccurate, and misleading\u201d.The company said the surging price of biomass had made the generating unit \u201cuneconomical\u201d to run at the agreed subsidy level, which assumed the average cost of biomass would be about $181 a tonne. In 2022 the price reached a peak of $467 a tonne.A Drax spokesperson said: \u201cThe Russians\u2019 invasion [of Ukraine] created unprecedented challenges to the electricity market due to constrained fuel supplies, leading to an increase in both the demand for biomass and the price of pellets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The authors advise that world needs to:\nRetire about 240 average-sized coal-fired power plants a year, every year between now and 2030.\nConstruct the equivalent of three New Yorks\u2019 worth of public transport systems in cities around the world each year this decade.\nHalt deforestation, which is happening to an area the size of 15 football pitches every minute, this decade.\nIncrease the rate of growth of solar and wind power from its current high of 14% a year to 24% a year.\nCut meat consumption from ruminants such as cows and sheep to about two servings a week in the US, Europe and other high-consuming countries by 2030.\nThe prospect of staying within 1.5C will slip away altogether without drastic action, the authors warned. Sophie Boehm, research associate at the World Resources Institute and lead author of the report, said: \u201cGlobal efforts to limit warming to 1.5C are lacklustre at best. Despite decades of dire warnings and wake-up calls, our leaders have largely failed to mobilise climate action anywhere near the pace and scale needed.

Many countries are also still expanding their fossil fuel production: for instance, in the UK, the government last week announced new annual licensing rounds for exploration projects in the North Sea.Countries including the UK are also increasing subsidies and tax breaks for fossil fuels. After Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, government financing for fossil fuels increased sharply: subsidies almost doubled from 2020 rates, to reach the highest levels seen in nearly a decade, according to the report.The State of Climate Action 2023 report, published on Tuesday and compiled by six climate thinktanks, examined all aspects of climate policy from governments across the world. Although other recent studies have found a rapid acceleration of the uptake of green technology around the world, including the expansion of renewable energy, the report found few bright spots.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They are not the only bioluminescent sharks \u2013 roughly one in 10 species has that ability \u2013 but at up to 1.8 metres, kitefins are by far the biggest that have been found.J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mallefet, a biologist at the Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Belgium, had been hoping for years to see a glowing kitefin shark. \u201cThat was one of my holy grails, to see that big shark glowing,\u201d he says. Studies in the 1980s suggested they have light-emitting organs in their brown skin, but nobody had seen one alive and illuminated.Three sides of a kitefin shark. Photograph: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mallefet/FNRSHis dream came true 1,000 miles east of New Zealand, onboard a fisheries research vessel that was using a huge, commercial-scale trawl net to survey species inhabiting the twilight zone, about 800 metres down. Previous surveys of the area regularly caught kitefin sharks, but Mallefet was the first person to carefully transfer them into a darkened room. With the lights turned down low, he saw the live kitefin sharks had a blue-green glow across their bodies.Smaller species of deep-sea sharks use their lights for survival and to communicate with one another. Some have spines on their backs that are illuminated like lightsabers, warning intruders to leave them alone. Some males illuminate their claspers, the shark equivalent of a penis, a trick that presumably helps attract mates. And many of the sharks have glowing bellies, which help them hide their silhouettes from predators lurking beneath them in the deep, by blending into the blue light from the surface.But kitefin sharks are so big they don\u2019t need to worry much about hiding from other predators.Mallefet believes their glowing underside may illuminate the seabed to help them hunt, while at the same time letting them sneak up on prey without being seen.This would also explain how kitefins have been found with much faster-swimming sharks in their stomachs. Kitefins are among the slowest of all sharks; at their normal cruising speed, it would take them more than 10 minutes to amble 100 metres. These big, slow sharks are probably gliding around the twilight zone and launching surprise attacks on prey that rest on the bottom. \u201cJust like a cat jumping on the mouse,\u201d says Mallefet.To produce light, sharks have tiny cup-shaped structures, called photophores, dotted across their skin.

It found that in some cases, customers were having to wait 10 to 15 years to secure a connection for solar installations.MPs said there were three key areas where the current approach on grid connection was delaying progress: a lack of physical infrastructure such as cables and transformers; poor availability of data on solar photovoltaic generation, particularly for small-scale installations; and a \u201cqueueing system\u201d of applications where developers are applying for grid connections without the project having planning permission.Though the committee said solar energy did not need subsidies due to how cheap it was to generate, it did find that the costs of installation could be prohibitive.MPs recommended the government should consider consulting on how it could facilitate affordable loans for households, and to give a VAT discount to household battery storage.The committee is launching another inquiry into the lack of connectivity in the UK, looking at barriers hindering low-carbon technologies from connecting to the grid. It will also consider the potential for a smarter and more flexible grid that enables dynamic demand management and peer-to-peer electricity trading and storing.The chair of the committee, Philip Dunne, said the delays could stop the UK from reaching net zero emissions by 2050.He said: \u201cThere is potential for solar energy to have a bright future in the UK, but a dark cloud of delays for the industry hinders the ability to meet its full potential. Evidence to our committee made clear that the UK has the potential to fulfil the UK\u2019s ambition of 70GW of generating capacity from solar. But sticking points for households around access to finance and VAT being slapped on batteries remain.\u201cThe ability for low-carbon energy sources, including solar, to be able to connect to the grid could seriously jeopardise net zero Britain. Our solar inquiry found that some developers wait up to 15 years for a grid connection: this simply isn\u2019t good enough. We must make sure that concerns around infrastructure and planning are addressed swiftly.\u201cGiven our committee\u2019s mounting concerns over grid connections for low-carbon energy projects, we are today launching a new inquiry that will consider this in greater detail. I encourage anyone with views on these issues to submit evidence.\u201d",

The scheme\u2019s current budget is underspent, according to PA, as households balk at the cost and complexity of switching.UK must offer businesses certainty over green energy, says boss of FTSE 100 firmRead moreThe infrastructure tsars called on the government to spend up to \u00a34bn every year for the next 12 years to cover the full cost of heat pump installations, and support energy-efficiency improvements for the 1.5 million households on the lowest incomes in England.It also said the better off should be given access to 0% finance to cover additional costs beyond the heat pump grant and for further funds to be invested to update social housing heating systems.Around 8m buildings will need to switch from gas boilers, which heat around nine in 10 English properties, to cleaner alternatives by 2035 to meet the UK\u2019s 2050 net zero target, the commission said.Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus Energy \u2013 which has invested heavily in developing heat pumps \u2013 said: \u201cWe see enormous demand for heat pumps as they\u2019re three or four times more energy efficient than gas boilers, and with these government grants they\u2019re affordable to install too.\u201dThe government said it has set aside \u00a310m to support innovation to cut installation costs of heat pumps.

        "text": "Three \u201csuper-tipping points\u201d for climate action could trigger a cascade of decarbonisation across the global economy, according to a report.Relatively small policy interventions on electric cars, plant-based alternatives to meat and green fertilisers would lead to unstoppable growth in those sectors, the experts said.But the boost this would give to battery and hydrogen production would mean crucial knock-on benefits for other sectors including energy storage and aviation.Urgent emissions cuts are needed to avoid irreversible climate breakdown and the experts say the super-tipping points are the fastest way to drive global action, offering \u201cplausible hope\u201d that a rapid transition to a green economy can happen in time.The tipping points occur when a zero-carbon solution becomes more competitive than the existing high-carbon option. More sales lead to cheaper products, creating feedback loops that drive exponential growth and a rapid takeover. The report, launched at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said the three super-tipping points would cut emissions in sectors covering 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions.Speedy action is vital to help avoid triggering disastrous tipping points in the climate system. Scientists said recently that global heating had driven the world to the brink of multiple tipping points with global impacts, including the collapse of Greenland\u2019s ice cap and a key current in the north Atlantic.\u201cWith time running out, there is a need for action to be targeted,\u201d said Mark Meldrum, at the consultancy Systemiq, which produced the report with partners including the University of Exeter, UK. Each super-tipping point crossed raises the chance of crossing others, he said. \u201cThat could set off a cascade to steer us away from a climate catastrophe.\u201dThe tipping point for electric vehicles is very close with sales soaring, the report says. Setting dates around the world for the end of sales of fossil-fuel powered vehicles, such as the 2030 date set for new vehicles by the UK and 2035 in China, drives further growth, the report adds.This scale-up means the batteries used will become cheaper and these can be deployed as storage for wind and solar power, further accelerating the growth of renewables. More green energy means lower electricity bills, in turn making heat pumps even more cost-effective.The second super-tipping point is setting mandates for green fertilisers, to replace current fertilisers, which are produced from fossil gas. Ammonia is a key ingredient and can be made from hydrogen produced by renewable energy, combined with nitrogen from the air.Governments requiring a growing proportion of fertiliser to be green will drive a scale-up and cost reductions in the production of green hydrogen, the report says. That then supports long-distance aviation and shipping, and steel production, which will rely on hydrogen to end their carbon emissions. Mandates are being considered with India, for example, targeting 5% green fertiliser production by 2023\u201324 and 20% by 2027\u201328.The third super-tipping point is helping alternative proteins to beat animal-based proteins on cost, while at least matching them on taste. Meat and dairy cause about 15% of global emissions. Public procurement of plant-based meat and dairy replacements by government departments, schools and hospitals could be a powerful lever, the report says.Increasing uptake would cut the emissions from cattle and reduce the destruction of forests for pasture land. A 20% market share by 2035 would mean 400m-800m hectares of land would no longer be needed for livestock and their fodder, equivalent to 7-15% of the world\u2019s farmland today, the report estimated. That land could then be used for the restoration of forests and wildlife, removing CO2 from the air.Tipping points already passed within countries include electric car sales in Norway and the plunge in coal-powered electricity in the US in the past decade.\u201cWe need to find and trigger positive socioeconomic tipping points if we are to limit the risk from damaging climate tipping points,\u201d said Prof Tim Lenton at the University of Exeter. \u201cThis non-linear way of thinking about the climate problem gives plausible grounds for hope: the more that gets invested in socioeconomic transformation, the faster it will unfold \u2013 getting the world to net zero greenhouse gas emissions sooner.\u201d",

Unlike ibis, the cockatoos are unique to far north Queensland in Australia, living in the remote savannahs of Cape York. (They are more widespread in New Guinea and the Indonesian Aru Islands, so Birds Queensland is encouraging the government to involve our neighbours in celebrations, using the cockatoo as a tool of soft diplomacy.)For all the behaviours cited in the first paragraph, palm cockatoos are ridiculously charismatic. I\u2019ve seen them for myself. Late last November, in the mind-melting heat of Kutini-Payamu national park on northern Cape York, I watched a pair in full display for half an hour as the male showed off a prospective hollow to its mate.They are an unforgettable sight. And they are super marketable. Dr Christina Zdenek, who has been researching the birds for over a decade, asks us to imagine the spectacle (not to mention cacophony) of a stadium full of people with big crested hats on their heads and drumming on the seats.Which, yes, would probably mean everyone would have to stand up to see. Still, that\u2019s got to be better than everyone conking the person in front of them on the head with ibis-billed projections on their noggins. Whatever: we are talking about a lot of plush toys here, folks. And Olympic recognition could spur immediate action for palm cockatoo conservation.Australia Weekend signupBecause palm cockatoos need our help. Like many of our large arboreal birds, including owls and other cockatoos, the biggest threat is the loss of mature trees \u2013 at least 300 years old \u2013 containing hollows large enough to house the species. Land clearing and late dry-season fires are destroying the species\u2019 breeding habitat.The birds have a hard enough time breeding as it is. Though long-lived, palm cockatoos are especially slow to reproduce. Females lay just one egg every two years and, for reasons that are not entirely clear, have an extremely high nest failure rate: on average, only one chick successfully fledges (that is, leaves the nest) every decade.Quick GuideHow to get the latest news from Guardian AustraliaShow Email:\u00a0sign up for our\u00a0daily morning and afternoon email newslettersApp:\u00a0download our free app\u00a0and never miss the biggest storiesSocial:\u00a0follow us on YouTube,\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0or\u00a0TwitterPodcast:\u00a0listen to our daily episodes on\u00a0Apple Podcasts,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite appPhotograph: Tim Robberts/Stone RFWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Making, shipping, installing and maintaining artificial nest boxes on remote Cape York is unlikely to be economically feasible, and there\u2019s no guarantee the cockatoos would use them anyway.

She might be even more thrilled if she\u2019d seen them in Yorkshire.The climate crisis has prompted the Royal Horticultural Society to plan a move of its important collection of rhododendrons from its flagship Wisley garden in Surrey to Harlow Carr in North Yorkshire, the Guardian can reveal.It follows similar decisions to move Wisley\u2019s national collections of rhubarb and gooseberries to the Bridgewater garden in Salford.On one level the move is pragmatic in that all the plants are expected to do better in the north of England because of a changing climate.Dry springs and warmer temperatures generally have meant rhododendrons have been struggling in some parts of southern England. \u201cThey\u2019re surviving but they\u2019re not really thriving,\u201d said Paul Cook, Harlow Carr\u2019s curator.Visitors on the winter walk at RHS Harlow Carr in Harrogate, North Yorkshire.

Before that it was the display garden of the Northern Horticultural Society, with the driving force being the gardener, writer and broadcaster Geoffrey Smith, a regular on Radio 4\u2019s Gardeners\u2019 Question Time.A lot of the planting Smith did in the 1950s and 1960s needs replacing which, said Cook, meant \u201cwe\u2019ve got plenty of room in the 30-odd acres of woodland we\u2019ve got and that\u2019s one of the long-term plans, to have a collection that will in the next 50 years be maturing and become really important regardless of which garden it\u2019s at\u201d.Some rhododendrons may also go to Salford where they might well do even better, said Cook. The plan does not mean Wisley will be without rhododendrons and it may instead have American hybrids, which prefer warmer summers.\u201cIt\u2019s not about one garden having one collection, it is about spreading the collections around the country as well.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The EU made 410TWh of electricity from sources that release planet-heating gases, which analysts say is the lowest level since 2015 \u2013 the first year for which they have monthly data \u2013 and \u201cvery likely\u201d since 2000.The drop in fossil fuel generation was driven by a fall in demand for electricity, as well as some growth in clean power, the study found.\u201cWe\u2019re glad to see fossil fuels down, but in the long-term it is not going to be sustainable to rely on the fall in demand to do this,\u201d said Matt Ewen, a data analyst at Ember and author of the report. \u201cWe have to be replacing this energy rather than just expecting it to go away and not be used.\u201dTo try to stop the planet heating, the EU has promised to cut greenhouse gas pollution by at least 55% from 1990 levels by the end of the decade, and hit net zero emissions by 2050. To get there, it will probably have to use less energy but more electricity than it does today, as more people heat homes and drive cars with electricity instead of fossil fuels.The report found that fossil generation in the first half of 2023 fell more than 20% in 11 EU countries and more than 30% in five of them. Fourteen countries saw their lowest total fossil generation on record for the period. In seven countries \u2013 Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Poland and Slovenia \u2013 fossil fuel burning hit its lowest levels this century.The findings back up analysis in June from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), a nonprofit research organisation, which showed \u201ca clear shift away from fossil fuel-based power generation in the EU\u201d.But even as high energy prices have brought down demand, \u201cthe EU\u2019s reliance on fossil fuels persists\u201d, said Petras Katinas, an energy analyst at CREA and co-author of the report.He said: \u201cThis dependence extends to external sources as well. Given that a significant portion of the EU\u2019s fossil fuel needs are met through imports from third countries, a vulnerability exists.

Wind generation rose by 5%, while hydropower grew 11% after a shortfall from widespread drought last year. Nuclear generation fell 4%, but is set to climb during the year.Several countries broke records for the share of their power that came from renewable sources of energy, the report found. Greece and Romania passed 50% for the first time and Denmark and Portugal broke 75%.After Russia invaded Ukraine last year, gas prices shot up and the EU introduced emergency measures to cut demand.

Analysis by the thinktank E3G shows hydrogen blending could increase the average household\u2019s heating bill by about \u00a3192 a year.In the letter, seen by the Guardian, the groups warn that blending hydrogen into the gas supply would require consumers to use more gas, as hydrogen provides less energy than fossil gas when used in this way. \u201cWe disagree with the report\u2019s recommendation to stimulate demand for hydrogen through blending and heating,\u201d wrote the groups, led by E3G.\u201cThis puts the early costs of building the hydrogen economy on the shoulders of consumers, who will bear the costs of higher energy bills and costs of conversion \u2013 on top of the proposed \u2018hydrogen levy\u2019 set out in the energy bill. As hydrogen is more expensive than the gas currently used to heat most UK homes, a 20% blend can only raise consumer prices. Raising energy bills during a cost of living crisis is the wrong way to develop industrial demand for hydrogen.\u201dThe government is expected to decide this year whether to press ahead with plans for the blending of hydrogen into the UK\u2019s natural gas networks, which could happen as soon as 2025. Ministers are also considering a hydrogen levy on bills to fund its development.The hydrogen champion report calls on the government to \u201cmake the strategic decision to support blending of hydrogen into the gas network in 2023 and confirm a \u2018minded to\u2019 position on suitable commercial arrangements to support blending\u201d.Hydrogen is being touted as a potentially green fuel, to help the UK meet its goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. But campaigners have two concerns: first, that hydrogen should be produced from renewable energy rather than as a byproduct from fossil fuel production; and that some uses being suggested for hydrogen are unsuitable.The government is still considering hydrogen for home heating, because some gas specialists argue it could be used in current boilers without the need for new infrastructure. But a growing number of studies show that hydrogen would be unsuitable, or prohibitively expensive, for heating compared with alternative technologies such as heat pumps.The letter also raises concerns over \u201chydrogen-ready boilers\u201d. These are essentially the same as existing gas boilers, and the attraction \u2013 for the government, and for installers and suppliers \u2013 is that they could be used without major changes to the UK\u2019s existing gas heating infrastructure.But experts doubt hydrogen-ready boilers will ever use hydrogen, because hydrogen produces less heat than natural gas, and as sources of green hydrogen are likely to be limited it makes more sense to use that hydrogen for industrial processes where there are few or no green alternatives, than for home heating where heat pumps offer a solution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Value for money will be a key factor in determining whether to enable the wider rollout of blending on to the gas network.\u201cThe government is working closely with Ofgem and industry to explore how hydrogen could be fairly incorporated in bills and any final decision on blending will be made alongside a decision on how best to protect consumers.\u201d",

This level of growth depends on British factories attracting the next generation of electric models and scaling up the supply chain.Production has steadily recovered since the Covid-19 pandemic and manufacturing jobs in the sector rose 4% to 208,000 in the last year. A further 24,513 battery electric vehicles joined the road in May, up 58.7% year on year to secure a 16.9% market share.Last year, when Britain\u2019s annual car production fell by nearly a tenth to 775,014, the lowest in more than six decades, UK factories produced a record 234,066 battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid and hybrid electric vehicles, with combined volumes rising 4.5% year-on-year to make up nearly a third of overall output.On Tuesday, the SMMT called on all political parties to recognise the strategic importance of the sector to the UK, which faces fierce global competition as other countries offer huge cash incentives and subsidies to attract green manufacturing.The business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, told the conference she had \u201cheard very loud and clear the issues on rules of origin\u201d, and said she planned to raise the issue with the EU\u2019s ambassador to the UK on Tuesday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The researchers compared the actual moves the players made against the optimal moves determined by the powerful chess engine Stockfish.In the tournament venues, the researchers attached three web-connected air quality sensors to measure carbon dioxide, PM2.5 concentrations, and temperature. Each tournament lasted eight weeks, meaning players faced a variety of air conditions.Fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, refers to tiny particles 2.5 microns or less in diameter, which are often expelled by burning matter such as that from car engines, coal plants, forest fires, and wood burners.\u201cWe find that when individuals are exposed to higher levels of air pollution, they make more mistakes, and they make larger mistakes,\u201d said Juan Palacios, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sustainable Urbanization Lab and a co-author of the paper.Researchers looked at historical data to see if their findings were replicated, using data from 20 years of games from the first division of the German chess league. After accounting for other causes such as noise, temperature changes and carbon dioxide concentrations, they found air pollution accounted for dips in player performance.\u201cIt\u2019s pure random exposure to air pollution that is driving these people\u2019s performance,\u201d Palacios said. \u201cAgainst comparable opponents in the same tournament round, being exposed to different levels of air quality makes a difference for move quality and decision quality.\u201dChess.com\u2019s Leon Watson said that professional players were already monitoring air quality while they played: \u201cCognition is obviously incredibly important in chess and already some of the top players like Magnus Carlsen and Anish Giri have cottoned on to how important air quality is.\u201cWhen competing from home in the big Champions Chess Tour events, players now routinely monitor their CO2 and particulate matter levels using [air monitors] and use the data to create the perfect environment to play in \u2026 like in any sport, fine margins are important.

There sat a pocket-sized gold monster with a triangular back, and eyes like a cat but without the \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you\u201d stare.My dad, a wizard with tools, quickly knocked up a hutch. Sadly, the frog had to be freed a few months later when we moved house.Our new place was an ex-council semi with a garden that felt like a rainforest. That might be because the lawn hadn\u2019t been mowed and the grass was up to my waist. My younger brother fished most of a car engine out of the earth. I got something cooler: a frog on steroids that my dad told me was a common toad.He was the size of a burger, didn\u2019t move unless necessary, and had terrifying eyebrows. I named him Touchwood after a toad on TV I\u2019d heard about.My dad got out his toolkit again and built a 3ft-high version of Claridge\u2019s \u2013 moss; roof slates to hide under; a sunken bath made out of a mixing bowl. I was very jealous of Touchwood\u2019s living space as I was sharing a bedroom with my brother, who had become interested in welding and used to practise on the carpet.In a book on frogs that my parents got me, it said toads could live for 40 years. Even if Touchwood lasted 10, he would be around past the year 2000. By that point, I figured, time travel and cloning would have been cracked. When Touchwood finally passed away, I would be able to go back and do a Jurassic Park.As it was, Mr T lasted only nine more hibernations before he croaked it one summer. I admit that, by then, my head had been turned: I\u2019d got into breakbeat music, and luminous poison dart frogs seemed a better fit colour-wise. Not that I ever owned one, but the clips I\u2019d seen on David Attenborough showed them leaping and eating gracefully. That wasn\u2019t Touchwood\u2019s style. Whenever I dug him up a worm, he\u2019d wrestle it, as if he was trying to swallow a sausage dog.One morning as a teen, I excitedly thought I\u2019d got Touchwood\u2019s sex wrong and he \u2013 no, she \u2013 had laid eggs. According to my manual, they came out in a string; as I lifted the sticky threads off its back legs I thought: \u201cI\u2019m going to be a grandad.\u201dMy exhilaration crashed when my mate came over and told me that toad eggs didn\u2019t look like that. Touchwood must have swallowed some long grass earlier; now it was coming out the other end.In the end, it was my mum who cloned Touchwood when she surprised me one afternoon with a flat-warming present: a fire-bellied toad. Gimlet, as my girlfriend and I named him, used to jump around his tank, and press himself against the plastic to show off the orange flashes on his underside. In the right lighting, it looked like I had a Blackpool player in my front room. As flashy as he was, he was no replacement for the original. Cheers for the all the good luck you brought me, Touchwood.",

Many oil companies intend to increase the amount of oil and gas they produce until 2030.Andrew Mason, the head of active ownership at abrdn, said the investor had reservations about the implications of shareholder climate resolutions because they were raised separately from financial statements or annual report and accounts.Mason said: \u201cThis can sever the fundamental link between the climate and corporate strategy, risking a lack of robust governance procedures for all vital strategic decisions.

Those rules have led to just 20 new onshore turbines being given planning permission in the last nine years.Gove said: \u201cTo increase our energy security and develop a cleaner, greener economy, we are introducing new measures to allow local communities to back onshore wind power projects. This will only apply in areas where developments have community support, but these changes will help build on Britain\u2019s enormous success as a global leader in offshore wind, helping us on our journey to net zero.\u201dClaire Coutinho, the new energy secretary, said: \u201cOnshore wind also has a key role to play and these changes will help speed up the delivery of projects where local communities want them.\u201dThe current rules allow local authorities to stop a developer building new wind turbines if there are any unresolved queries from local residents. They ban planning authorities from giving the go-ahead to a new development unless it has been included in the last local plan, a document that can cover several years\u2019 worth of prospective building.Under the new system, councils will be required to consider the views of the entire community rather than bowing to a single objection. They will be allowed to identify new onshore wind in other ways apart from a local plan, and the government plans to introduce an incentive scheme to make sure local residents see some of the economic benefit of new developments.The measures are the result of weeks of negotiation between ministers and a group of prospective Tory rebels who had threatened to derail the energy bill that is being debated in the Commons. That group was led by Alok Sharma, the president of Cop26 in 2021, and included Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.Onshore windfarms, which are one of the fastest and cheapest renewable energy sources to build, still face barriers that other infrastructure such as waste incinerators and even coalmines are not subject to, green experts said.Sam Richards, Johnson\u2019s former environment adviser, said: \u201cToday\u2019s change tips the balance back in favour of local people who back onshore wind in their area, and should end the perverse situation we currently have whereby a single objection could block a development even if the majority are in favour.\u201dSome argued that the changes did not go far enough.

But farming experts strongly dispute the potential for such projects.Food grown on lowland peat in England has a much higher carbon footprint than imports of soya from Brazil, according to the research, from the Green Alliance thinktank. That is because wet peat sequesters carbon, but when peat is drained and farmed it emits about 19 times as much carbon as non-peat cropland.The Green Alliance said the findings showed that rewetting peat, through removing drainage or building dams to retain water on the land, should be a government priority. Lowland peat occupies only about 1% of the UK\u2019s farmland, so even if half were rewetted it would have little impact on land availability, according to the analysis, but make a substantial contribution to the UK\u2019s efforts to reach net zero.However, farmers said drained peatlands \u2013 including the fens of East Anglia \u2013 were some of the UK\u2019s most productive farmland, so a simple comparison of land area would not reflect their true value.Farming is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions but so far government efforts to reduce agricultural emissions have not produced the changes needed. Farmers could be given stronger incentives to rewet lowland peat on their farms through the government\u2019s environmental land management schemes, as current incentives appear ineffective, according to the Green Alliance analysis.Lydia Collas, the author of the research at Green Alliance, said: \u201cIn its natural form, lowland peat can support a huge range of wetland species and absorb significant rainfall, preventing flooding downstream.\u201cEveryone knows that clearing Brazilian rainforest for soya production is a disaster for the climate and for nature, but we\u2019re sabotaging our own environment by growing grain on lowland peat.\u201dFarmers were unconvinced, however. Aidan Gill, an environment policy adviser at the National Farmers\u2019 Union, said the impacts on food of rewetting peat could be substantial, depending on the areas affected.\u201cThe highly productive East Anglian fens produce more than 7% of England\u2019s total agricultural production, worth \u00a31.2bn, so rewetting peat soils [there] would be quite a significant land use change and have a big impact on UK food security,\u201d he said.He added that there were many practical obstacles, as fields could not be rewetted in isolation, and there was a risk of flooding to surrounding areas.Gareth Morgan, the head of farming policy at the Soil Association, also urged caution. \u201cThe fens are crucial for rural communities and domestic food production, supplying a third of British-grown vegetables.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It is the third national emergency to be declared in the country\u2019s history.The scale of damage is not yet known, with entire regions cut off from road access, electricity and mobile networks, neighbourhoods submerged by flood waters and landslides destroying homes and state highways.Redcliffe Bridge is closed off as debris piles up along the Tutaekuri River in the suburb of Taradale Photograph: Kerry Marshall/Getty ImagesShaw, who is co-leader of the Green party, attributed the scale of the disaster to the climate crisis, saying: \u201cThere will be people who say it\u2019s \u2018too soon\u2019 to talk about these things \u2026 but we are standing in it right now. This is a climate change-related event. The severity of it, of course, made worse by the fact that our global temperatures have already increased by 1.1 degrees.\u201cWe need to stop making excuses for inaction. We cannot put our heads in the sand when the beach is flooding. We must act now.\u201dScientists have long predicted that global heating would cause more frequent and intense weather events, including stronger storms and heavier, more sporadic rainfall. New Zealand\u2019s North Island has experienced extraordinarily heavy rains this summer: the MetService said on Tuesday that Auckland had 48% of its annual rainfall in just 45 days this year.Cyclone Gabrielle batters New Zealand \u2013 in pictures Read moreThe cyclone comes just two weeks after record rainfall caused devastating flooding in Auckland and Northland, damaging thousands of homes and killing four. At the time, the flood was named the most destructive climate-related event in New Zealand\u2019s history.The devastation from Cyclone Gabrielle is expected to overtake that. On Tuesday afternoon, there were no formal figures available yet on people injured or evacuated or the scale of houses and infrastructure damaged.\u201cJust when we thought we had had our worst climate-related disaster in this country only two weeks ago, we are facing an even more significant challenge,\u201d Shaw said.Quoting Winston Churchill, he said: \u201cThe era of procrastination, of half measures, of soothing and baffling expedience of delays is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences.\u201dIn an interview with the Guardian, Shaw said he had spoken to New Zealand\u2019s prime minister and finance minister about action that could allow those receiving insurance payments to rebuild their homes to relocate elsewhere instead.\u201cSome of those houses are in places where it\u2019s a bad idea to have a house,\u201d he said, referring to the \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of New Zealand homes built on flood plains or erosion-prone coastlines.\u201cThere are decisions that we could make that I think would lead to longer term resilience and a more adaptive response that if we don\u2019t make them, you\u2019ll probably just get a reversion to the status quo,\u201d said Shaw.But he cautioned against a shift away from reducing emissions in order to foot the bill for dealing with the effects of the climate crisis.\u201cThere will be a certain crowd who say \u2026 let\u2019s give up on stopping climate change and its focus entirely on responding to the effects of climate change and I cannot state enough what a catastrophic mistake that would be,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cBecause every tenth of a degree of warming increases the frequency and the severity of these events.\u201d",

They face being unfairly disadvantaged if rivals can get away with making false or misleading claims, the ACCC said: \u201cThis undermines effective competition and can create a disincentive for businesses to invest in sustainability.\u201dKnown broadly as \u201cgreenwashing\u201d, the practice of making vague or unwarranted claims has been in the sights of regulators for years. Firms have been able to avoid significant penalties for such action, although court cases might soon change that.The corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, this week launched its first court proceedings alleging greenwashing.ASIC alleges Mercer Superannuation (Australia) Ltd made statements on its website about seven \u201cSustainable Plus\u201d investment options that were misleading. Some investments had companies that website statements stated as excluded, such as fossil fuel producers, Whitehaven Coal and Glencore PLC, ASIC will tell the federal court.The ACCC said its sweep indicated a significant proportion of businesses may be making environmental claims that deserve closer scrutiny.\u201cAlready, we have several active investigations underway across the packaging, consumer goods, food manufacturing and medical devices sectors for alleged misleading environmental claims,\u201d Lowe said. \u201c[T]hese may grow, as we continue to conduct more targeted assessments into businesses and claims identified through the sweep.\u201dOf the eight sectors surveyed, cosmetic, clothing and footwear, and food and drink industries had the highest proportion of concerning claims. Vehicles and the electronics and home appliance sectors fared relatively well.Firms making vague and unqualified claims topped the list of most common issues, with many businesses describing their products as \u201cgreen\u201d, \u201ckind to the planet\u201d, \u201ceco-friendly\u201d, \u201cresponsible\u201d or \u201csustainable\u201d.\u201cThese claims have little value for consumers as they can have a variety of different meanings and rarely provide enough information to allow consumers to make an informed purchasing decision,\u201d the ACCC said.In other cases, companies were making claims without providing any supporting evidence. Some firms claimed to provide proof but the web links provided were broken, the watchdog said.Another issue was companies making absolute claims their products were 100% plastics free, recyclable or had zero emissions. These \u201chad the potential to be false\u201d, the ACCC said, adding firms needed to take \u201cparticular care to ensure that these claims are clear and backed by robust evidence\u201d.Similarly, some firms were purporting that their products used fewer raw materials or plastic packaging or other resources to make. However, consumers were not given details how much less material was needed, nor what the comparison involved.In other instances, companies exaggerated sustainability benefits or omitted negative attributes that might be relevant to a consumer\u2019s choice. For instance, a firm might promote investments in renewable energy projects but still source most of its products from fossil-fuel based industries, the ACCC said.Carbon emissions from global SUV fleet outweighs that of most countriesRead moreAnother business might claim that offsetting its carbon emissions had a \u201cpositive\u201d impact on the environment even though it had not taken steps to reduce its overall carbon emissions, the watchdog said.Another common practice for firms surveyed was to claim affiliation with a variety of certification schemes, an approach that could potentially mislead consumers.\u201cSome businesses have also created their own certification schemes for their own products,\u201d the ACCC said. \u201cThis raises concerns that [schemes] may be becoming meaningless, and no longer help consumers to distinguish between different products.\u201dThe watchdog also encouraged consumers to report any greenwashing concerns.",

About 20 million people across the US took part on the first Earth Day on 22 April 1970 and public pressure from the event is credited with ensuring the passing of the 1972 Clean Water Act. It has since become a global movement, with China, the US and the UK among dozens of countries to sign the Paris agreement on the 2016 Earth Day.Denis Hayes speaking at a climate rally in Washington DC in 2010. Photograph: Brendan Hoffman/Getty ImagesSpeaking to the Guardian, Hayes acknowledged that many companies now use Earth Day as an opportunity for greenwashing, but added that the movement has also encouraged companies to change.\u201c[Earth Day] is abused rather frequently. Of course, it\u2019s particularly upsetting to me when it\u2019s an event that I\u2019ve had something to do with. I take some solace in the fact that I think relatively few people anywhere are motivated to accept the sentiment behind \u2018Earth Day at Exxon\u2019. It just doesn\u2019t pass the giggle test,\u201d he said.\u201cIn 1970, we were focusing on the fact that schoolchildren were not allowed to go outside for recess because the air was too filthy, that streams that people swam and fished in were no longer accessible because they were laced with poison, and we were spraying everything with pesticides. These were important but more local issues. Now, the big global issues like climate change and the epidemic of extinctions are more in tune with Earth Day, somewhat akin to the threat of thermonuclear war was when I was young,\u201d he said.Corporate green claims are being increasingly scrutinised in the US, EU and the UK, with rules being tightened about what companies can say about the environmental credentials of their products and services. As well as encouraging genuine action to tackle the climate crisis, Earth Day has become a focal point for greenwashing.Plan to protect 30% of Earth divides and inspires at Cop15Read more\u201cAs early as 1990 when suddenly we were starting to get a fair amount of prominence once again, we had some of the most appalling clear cutters in the United States trumpeting their environmental credentials,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cWe held a press conference to condemn their misuse of the name. In Houston, Enron actually sponsored a big Earth Day festival. It\u2019s appalling but I can\u2019t think of anything to do about it.\u201cIt has nothing to do with the original sentiments that we had, or the things that motivate millions of people every year to come out and do something positive for the environment,\u201d he said.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

They are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down, and they are linked to cancer, fetal complications, liver disease, kidney disease, autoimmune disorders and other serious health issues.The study checked 21 major toilet paper brands in North America, western Europe, Africa, Central America and South America, but it did not name the brands.The peer-reviewed University of Florida report did not consider the health implications of people wiping with contaminated toilet paper. PFAS can be dermally absorbed, but no research on how it may enter the body during the wiping process exists. However, that exposure is \u201cdefinitely worth investigating, said David Andrews, senior scientist with the Environmental Working group, a public health non-profit that tracks PFAS pollution.Brands that used recycled paper had just as much PFAS as those that did not, and it may be that there is no avoiding PFAS in toilet paper, said Jake Thompson, the study\u2019s lead author and a University of Florida grad student\u201cI\u2019m not rushing to change my toilet paper and I\u2019m not saying that people should stop using or reduce the amount of toilet paper they use,\u201d he added. \u201cThe issue is that we\u2019re identifying another source of PFAS, and it highlights that the chemicals are ubiquitous.\u201dThe PFAS levels detected are low enough to suggest the chemicals are used in the manufacturing process to prevent paper pulp from sticking to machinery, Thompson said. PFAS are often used as lubricants in the manufacturing process and some of the chemicals are commonly left on or in consumer goods.In a statement to WSVN in Florida, a trade group representing the toilet paper industry said no PFAS is added to toilet paper. Thompson said \u201cevidence seems to suggest otherwise\u201d though it may be true that PFAS are not intentionally added.\u201cCompanies might not be aware that it\u2019s used because it might come from the manufacturer of the instruments they use,\u201d he said.Researchers detected six PFAS compounds, with 6:2 diPAP representing the highest levels. The compound has not been robustly studied, but is linked to testicular dysfunction. The study also found PFOA, a highly toxic compound, and 6:2 diPAP can turn into PFOA once in the environment.The average American uses 57 pounds of toilet paper a year and more than 19bn pounds of toilet paper flushed every year in the US. The study also checked wastewater at eight wastewater treatment plants and found it is likely that 6:2 diPAP in toilet paper represents much of the compound found in wastewater.However, PFAS are so common that it is difficult to pin their source with precision, which speaks to the larger issue around the chemicals\u2019 widespread use, Thompson said.\u201cAs a society we have to decide what to do about this problem,\u201d he said.",

It has endorsed five candidates who are standing for election to its council.Most prominent among the Restore Trust-backed candidates is the former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption.As members of the charity prepare to cast their votes in the governing council election, the National Trust spoke of its concern about the role of paid Restore Trust adverts on Facebook and their dissemination by political figures on social media.\u201cOur governance depends on independent citizens who are free from political influence, acting collectively in the best interests of this charity,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cAny political campaign to influence the governance of an independent charity would be concerning, and we are not the only charity coming under political pressure.\u201cWe are aware of [Restore Trust\u2019s] attempts to organise support among MPs.

Researchers estimate the whale to be about three to four years old.The residents contacted the visitor information center at Glacier Bay national park and reported that a whale near the Gustavus dock was \u201ctrailing two buoys, making unusual sounds and having trouble moving freely\u201d, the National Park Service said.In a press release issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Janet Neilson, an NPS whale biologist who was part of the rescue, said that park personnel located the whale from shore and confirmed that it was dragging two buoys.\u201cThey were able to get out on the water right away to confirm the entanglement and take photos of the animal and gear that helped paint a much more thorough picture,\u201d she said.Rescue team members including NPS patrol teams and experts involved with the Large Whale Entanglement Response network were soon able to determine that the whale\u2019s entanglement was \u201clife threatening\u201d, Noaa said in the release.The crew observed that the whale was swimming in a tight clockwise circle that \u201cappeared to be intermittently anchored to the seafloor\u201d by a 300lb crab pot with 450ft of heavy duty line, according to NPS.It added, the rescue team members were able to get in touch with the owner of the gear who said they had set the pot near Pleasant Island, which lies south-east of Gustavus. However, between Saturday and Sunday morning, the pot had gone missing, meaning that the whale had already been entangled for at least three days when residents reported the discovery, NPS said.Rescue team members were deployed on site the next day and used drone footage to collect aerial photographs and videos of the whale\u2019s entanglement.00:00:40Drone footage shows humpback whale entangled in heavy crab line off Alaska \u2013 video\u201cThis was a complicated entanglement with a line through the whale\u2019s mouth, and wrapped around the animal\u2019s tail stock,\u201d Fred Sharpe, advanced large whale entanglement responder with Alaska Whale Foundation, told the Noaa. \u201cThe drone imagery assisted tremendously with our understanding of the entanglement and how to prioritize our cutting attempts,\u201d he added.The NPS said the whale was making 7-9-minute dives and was at the surface for only approximately 30 seconds.\u201cThe whale had a loop of line through its mouth that led to a large, heavy glob of tangled lines at its tail.

The whale also had a distinct healed scar across its back from being hit by a vessel\u2019s propeller,\u201d it said.The crew was eventually able to make cuts into the line using specialized tools designed to keep responders at a safe distance from the whale. One of the tools includes a knife on the end of a 25ft carbon fiber pole and grappling hooks modified with razor-sharp knife blades inside the grapple to cut as they grab, the Noaa said.\u201cThe turning point came when we were able to cut the rope that ran through the whale\u2019s mouth and was wrapped around its tail,\u201d said Chris Gabriele, a whale biologist with Glacier Bay national park who was part of the rescue efforts.Crews spent hours cutting away at the rope to free the whale.Officials with the whale entanglement response team plan to look for the whale in the coming weeks to document its condition if it is still in the area.",

However, drivers in several EU countries have received fines, many totalling thousands of pounds, for failing to register their Ulez-compliant cars with TfL before driving into London.EU countries accuse TfL debt collectors of breaching data protection laws over London penalty finesRead moreSome have been penalised mistakenly under the separate low emissions zone (Lez) that covers heavy goods vehicles entering Greater London. One driver was fined nearly \u00a311,000 after a three-day visit in a hire car.A Belgian court bailiff, acting for TfL\u2019s collections agent Euro Parking Collection, is accused of abusing its legal powers to obtain more than 20,000 registered keeper details and pass them on to Euro Parking for UK enforcement. The bailiff has since had its official access to the vehicle licensing database suspended pending disciplinary proceedings while Belgian MPs have demanded their government take action to recover the money paid by drivers.Meanwhile, Dutch authorities have intervened after driver details were allegedly illegally obtained by an agent in Italy acting for Euro Parking and a group of 100 French drivers have begun a lawsuit claiming that their details were obtained unlawfully.According to Belgian MP Michael Freilich, who uncovered the alleged data abuse, Euro Parking is circumventing GDPR rules by employing EU based agents who obtain driver data on its behalf without disclosing it will be shared with a UK company. In correspondence seen by the Guardian, the Belgian bailiff was twice refused permission to use the vehicle licensing database for the purposes of Ulez enforcement.However, according to Freilich, the bailiff nonetheless used its official licence to obtain the details of drivers who were then issued with fines by Euro Parking Collection (EPC).\u201cEPC should cease these operations immediately, if necessary, by government action,\u201d he said. \u201cFurthermore, they should be compelled to repay all of the ill-gotten gains.\u201dThe Dutch vehicle licensing agency, RDW, said in June it had launched an investigation after complaints from drivers who had received hefty fines after visiting London in emissions-compliant cars. It said there is no data-sharing agreement between the UK and the Netherlands for Ulez enforcement and it had released driver details to an agent in Italy, which had implied it was for enforcement within the EU.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were also a chilling reminder of the perils faced both by journalists and environmental defenders \u2013 particularly Indigenous peoples and those working with them \u2013 in Latin America.Seven months have passed since the men were killed in the Javari valley region of the Amazon. On Monday, Brazilian police announced that they had arrested the alleged mastermind. Rubens Villar Coelho, nicknamed Col\u00f4mbia, was first detained on separate charges last July, when he denied any involvement in the crime. He has been accused of running an illegal fishing operation. Three other men are in custody over the deaths.Real justice for Mr Phillips and Mr Pereira would mean accountability not only for those who pulled the trigger, but for all those who have made the Amazon a dangerous place \u2013 police officers, businessmen or politicians who have turned a blind eye to depredations, or benefited from them. Journalists are at risk in many places, especially when they challenge powerful interests. This week, the Cameroonian journalist Martinez Zogo was found dead, after his abduction by unknown assailants. But they are in greatest danger in Latin America and the Caribbean, where 30, including Mr Phillips, were killed last year, according to a new report by the Committee to Protect Journalists \u2013 the highest figure ever, and double the number killed in Ukraine since Russia\u2019s invasion. As the CPJ\u2019s programme director, Carlos Mart\u00ednez de la Serna, noted: \u201cThe cost of attacking or killing a journalist is extremely low \u2026 There is never justice.\u201dLatin America is also the most dangerous region in the world for environmental protectors. A report by Global Witness last autumn found that of the 1,733 land and environmental defenders known to have been killed in the last decade, more than two-thirds died in Latin America, and almost two-fifths were Indigenous. The only thing they did wrong was getting in the way of those exploiting and destroying the natural world.Under Brazil\u2019s last president, the far-right Jair Bolsonaro, agribusiness and extractive industries had free rein. The reduced state presence in the Amazon created not only opportunities for criminals, but also a sense that they were immune to consequences. Thankfully, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has pledged to undo the damage wreaked by his predecessor and work towards zero deforestation of the rainforest. On his first day in office he signed seven executive orders to protect the environment. He has appointed the country\u2019s first minister for Indigenous peoples, S\u00f4nia Guajajara, and last week he met the Yanomami people in the Amazon state of Roraima, who have been enduring a humanitarian and health catastrophe after the invasion of their land by thousands of illegal miners.Marina Silva, the environment minister, has said that the \u201cenraged mob\u201d who launched the insurrection in Bras\u00edlia earlier this month included pro-Bolsonaro militants with links to illegal deforestation, mining, land-grabbing and fishing, angry that their era of \u201cguaranteed impunity\u201d was over. There is suspicion that more powerful forces behind the riot share a similar agenda. The threat is not over, and taking on such ruthless opponents is risky. It is also, unquestionably, necessary.",

It is what we decide now that will define the rest of humanity\u2019s future,\u201d she told a press conference at UN talks in Bonn, where governments are meeting to discuss the climate crisis.\u201cIf we do not [phase out fossil fuels], it will be a death sentence for countless people. It is already a death sentence for countless people,\u201d she said.Thunberg last Friday announced the end of her school strikes, which she has been undertaking on Fridays since 2018 in protest at political inaction on the climate crisis. The campaigner has left school but intends to carry on speaking out on climate issues, while also giving the spotlight to youth voices from the developing world.She said a lack of political will to halt fossil fuel exploration and use was threatening to raise global temperatures by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which could lead the climate to pass \u201ctipping points\u201d, a cascade of impacts that could create runaway global heating.\u201cWe are still rushing towards the cliff. We could trigger feedback loops that are beyond human control, that would throw countless billions under the bus,\u201d she said.The question of phasing out fossil fuels is expected to be a flashpoint at the Cop28 UN climate talks later this year. The summit will take place in Dubai, hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a major oil and gas producer.Many countries would like to see Cop28 produce a formal resolution to phase out fossil fuels, or at least to discuss such a phaseout as an official agenda item at the summit. But some countries, chiefly fossil fuel producers including Saudi Arabia, are staunchly opposed, and the UAE presidency has been cautious, saying there is not yet agreement on the agenda.Chairing the talks will be Sultan Al Jaber, a minister in the UAE government who is also chief of the country\u2019s national oil company, Adnoc, which is planning a massive expansion of fossil fuel production capacity.Eric Njuguna, a climate justice organiser from Kenya, speaking with Thunberg, said Al Jaber\u2019s dual role was a conflict of interest, and called on him to resign. \u201cIt is a stab in the back for poor countries to have a fossil fuel CEO on top of efforts to constrain the climate crisis,\u201d he said.Al Jaber has told the Guardian he will bring a \u201cbusiness mindset\u201d to the talks, and pointed to his role as co-founder of the Masdar renewable energy company in UAE. He visited the Bonn talks last Thursday, and told a public meeting: \u201cThe phasedown of fossil fuels is inevitable.\u201d But he stopped well short of promising to put a phaseout of fossil fuels on the Cop28 agenda.The talks in Bonn, which started last Monday and will end on Thursday, are to lay the groundwork for Cop28, the conference of the parties under the UN framework convention on climate change, which begins on 30 November.Progress at Bonn has been slow. Last week\u2019s discussions were characterised by disputes over rich countries that are failing to provide financial assistance to developing countries, to help them cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of the climate crisis.Alden Meyer, a senior associate at the thinktank E3G, said: \u201cMuch more work remains to be done to land an agreement at Cop28 for a just and equitable reduction of fossil fuel production and use in a timeframe that\u2019s consistent with the Paris [agreement] 1.5C goal.\u201d",

Within years, the lake\u2019s ecosystems could collapse and millions will be exposed to toxic dust contained within the drying lakebed, unless drastic steps are taken to cut water use.A team of 32 scientists and conservationists caution that the lake could decline beyond recognition in just five years. Their warning is especially urgent amid a historic western megadrought fueled by global heating. To save the lake, the report suggests 30-50% reductions in water use may be required, to allow 2.5m acre-feet of water to flow from streams and rivers directly into the lake over the next two years.\u201cWe really need to increase the speed of our response, and also increase our ambition for how much water we restore to the lake,\u201d said Ben Abbott, an ecologist at Brigham Young University and one of the report\u2019s lead authors.A couple walks along the receding edge of the Great Salt Lake. Photograph: Rick Bowmer/APDespite growing political momentum, Abbott said that existing policies and action plans will not be enough to save the lake from collapse. Already, the lake has lost 73% of its water and 60% of its surface area, as trillions of litres of water are diverted away from it to supply farms and homes. As a result, the lake is becoming saltier and uninhabitable to native flies and brine shrimp. Eventually, the lake will be unable to sustain the more than 10 million migratory birds and wildlife that frequent it.Declining lake levels could also make magnesium, lithium and other critical minerals extraction infeasible within the next two years. Dust from the exposed lakebed could further damage crops, degrade soil and cause snow to melt more quickly \u2013 triggering widespread economic losses for Utah\u2019s agriculture and tourism industries. Toxic sediment, laced with arsenic, from the lakebed can exacerbate respiratory conditions and heart and lung disease, and could increase residents\u2019 risk for cancer.Empty docks at the Antelope Island Marina due to record low water levels in August 2022.  Photograph: Rick Bowmer/AP\u201cThe last nail in the coffin is where we\u2019re at,\u201d said Kevin Perry, a University of Utah atmospheric scientist researching the Great Salt Lake dust. In parts of Utah that already suffer dangerous air quality in the summer and winter due to wildfire smoke and vehicle emissions, dust from the lake threatens to bring year-round pollution, Perry said.The climate crisis, which has increased average temperatures in northern Utah by 4F since the early 1900s, is further imperilling the lake, fuelling more severe droughts and heatwaves. But studies suggest that only about 9% of the lake\u2019s decline due to evaporation and reduced runoff can be blamed on climate change.A legacy of water overuse is the main threat to the largest saltwater lake in the western hemisphere, and huge water diversions to irrigate vast operations to grow alfalfa and hay are no longer sustainable in Utah, Abbott said, nor are lush lawns in cities and suburbs.Reef-like structures called microbialites, exposed by receding waters, at the Great Salt Lake.

Whisk in the cream of tartar, if using, and caster sugar, a third at a time, until the mix forms very stiff peaks.Spread the meringue into a roughly 20cm-wide disc on a large baking sheet lined with greaseproof paper, then bake in a 130C (110C fan)/260F/gas \u00be oven for three hours. Turn off the oven, keep the door closed and leave the meringue to cool down for at least two more hours.Meanwhile, put 800ml water in a large pan with the honey (or other sweetener) and the lemon zest and juice, and add the half-stick of cinnamon and vanilla extract, if using. Core the quinces, then chop into wedges, dropping them into the pan as you go (quince skin is fine to eat). Bring the pot up to a gentle simmer and leave to cook for about two hours (alternatively, to save energy, cook in a slow cooker for four to five hours). Lift out the quince pieces and set aside to cool, then, if need be, bring the remaining liquid to a boil, reduce to a syrup and leave to cool.Break the chocolate into small pieces, put these in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of hot, just-simmering water, and stir to melt.Put the meringue on a platter, top with the whipped double cream and pieces of quince, drizzle over the chocolate sauce and finish with a scattering of toasted hazelnuts.",

Hormonally active cancers are common and hard to cure, making deeper inquiry into potential environmental causes critical, the researchers said.\u201cPeople should care about this because we know that there is widespread human exposure to these chemicals and we have documented data on that,\u201d said Max Aung, assistant professor of environmental health at the USC Keck School of Medicine and a senior author of the study.\u201cThese chemicals can increase the risk of various different health outcomes and they can alter your biological pathways \u2026 That is important to know so that we can better prevent exposures and mitigate risks,\u201d Aung said.It\u2019s nearly impossible to avoid exposure to PFAS, because the chemicals are so widespread in the environment. Sometimes called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down, PFAS residues can persist in water, soil, air and food. An estimated 97% of Americans have PFAS in their blood, according to the CDC. The US Geological Survey (USGS), a unit of the US Department of Interior, says that 45% of US drinking water is contaminated with PFAS.Notably, the research team found differences in women from different racial groups \u2013 links between PFAS and ovarian and uterine cancers were seen mainly in white women, while associations between chemicals known as phenols and breast cancer were seen largely in non-white women.The researchers said it was not clear exactly why such differences exist, but could be due to dietary habits and proximity to contaminated drinking water sources, among other factors.The new study is based on analysis of data collected through a CDC biomonitoring program from 2005 to 2018 involving more than 10,000 people. Researchers looked at prior cancer diagnoses and levels of PFAS and phenols in blood and urine collected from study participants.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Researchers said they also found a link between PFNA and uterine cancer.The work does not prove that exposure to PFAS and phenols led to these cancer diagnoses, the researchers said, but is a strong sign that the chemicals play a role and should be studied further.The study is part of ongoing research funded by the National Institutes of Environmental Health to \u201cbetter understand\u201d how PFAS chemicals are affecting human health. There are thousands of different types of PFAS, and research on their health effects is still evolving, though certain types of PFAS have already been linked through prior scientific research to multiple health problems including cancer, decreased fertility and kidney disease.In addition to Aung, the study was conducted by researchers affiliated with the Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment at the University of California, San Francisco; the University of Southern California; and the University of Michigan.

        "text": "The olive oil industry is \u201cin crisis\u201d, and the heatwave in southern Europe is threatening to inflict the second bad harvest in a row and gaps on shelves this autumn.After a spring heatwave affected flowering in Spain, which produces about half of the global olive crop, the harvest was forecast to be only 28% up on last year, which was the worst in almost a decade.The International Olive Oil Council predicted that the country would produce 850,000 tonnes, compared with 1.3m tonnes in a typical year and just 660,000 last year. That forecast was issued before the current period of high temperatures.The industry fears that production could end up being even worse as a second heatwave in a week brings temperatures of up to 43C this week to some southern parts of Spain, prompting trees to drop unripe fruits in order to preserve moisture.A graphic showing olive oil production in Spain and rest of the EU\u201cIn Spain we already know it is going to be another bad year, but no one has got to grips with the what\u2019s currently happening. The record temperatures are not going to help the situation,\u201d said Walter Zanre, the chief executive of the UK arm of Filippo Berio, the world\u2019s largest olive oil producer.\u201cI can\u2019t share how much anxiety this is causing us. Last year, Spain came into crop with a bit of carry-over [from the year before], which negated the shortfall somewhat. This year the barrels are dry. Even if Spain produces the predicted 850,000 tonnes, the price situation is worse.\u201dZanre said that the probable shortages meant prices were likely to rise further amid similarly poor harvests in Italy and Portugal. Wholesale prices have doubled since the beginning of 2022. In the UK, the retail price of olive oil was up 47% year on year to an average \u00a36.16 for 500ml in May, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.Given that the autumn harvest is unlikely to produce new oil until November and that last year\u2019s supplies are expected to run out by September, at present rates of consumption, it is possible that supermarkets could see shortages in the autumn.Tomato producers in Italy are also concerned about the impact of the heatwave, after flooding wiped out more than 15% of the crop planted this year. If the extreme temperatures in the country last longer than a few days, they could damage the remaining crops, which are almost ready for harvest.Diego Pariotti, the commercial director for exports at Conserve Italia, which produces the Cirio brand of tinned tomatoes and passata, said the group was estimating that production would be down by just 10%, with this year\u2019s second harvest in August more likely to be affected by this week\u2019s heatwave.But Pariotti added that the almost ripe fruits waiting to be picked in the coming weeks could also be at risk of damage if Italy\u2019s heatwave, in which temperatures have exceeded 40C, continued for more than a few days. \u201cMature fruit can be burned,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a worry for sure.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is not too extreme to say that olive oil is an industry in crisis. Although the prices are very high, nobody is getting rich,\u201d he said.Fears for the future have grown as the climate crisis worsens. Filippo Berio has widened the areas it sources olives from, turning to countries such as Turkey and even Chile in order to supplement supplies from traditional growing regions such as Italy, Greece and Spain.",

However, it is assumed that they also irritate the animal.\u201cI think the grey whales have a love-hate relationship with their whale lice,\u201d said Mark Carwardine, a British zoologist with wide experience in the region. \u201cThey have very sensitive skin, and thousands of these little creatures holding on tight, or moving about, with their exceedingly sharp, recurved claws, must drive them nuts.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt can actually hurt when a whale louse grabs hold of your finger \u2013 it feels like tiny pinpricks.\u201d00:01:04A grey whale approaches a whale-watching boat and has lice picked off \u2013 videoFranco picked a louse off the head of the whale the first time it came close enough for him to do so. \u201cOnce I removed the first one, she approached again so that I could continue,\u201d he said. The same individual whale has returned repeatedly for more \u201cgrooming\u201d, according to Franco.Like many of the relatively slow-moving great whales, including humpbacks and right whales, grey whales \u2013 which can grow up to 15 metres (50ft) in length \u2013 are particularly susceptible to parasites. They also acquire barnacles as they graze on minute amphipods at the silty bottom of the sea.The grey whales off Baja California are celebrated for their inquisitive behaviour towards boats, even though they were hunted drastically in the 20th century. They were known to whalers as \u201cdevil fish\u201d on account of their ferocity in fighting back against hunters, whose tactics included killing a nursing female\u2019s calf to ensure the adult came close enough to be harpooned. The whale\u2019s only other predator is the orca.While he could not confirm that approaching humans for delousing help constituted new behaviour in whales, Carwardine said he had not seen it before. \u201cThe whales certainly don\u2019t seem to mind when people pick them off, although you\u2019d have to pick off hundreds to make much of a difference,\u201d he said.Ships are turning whales into \u2018ocean roadkill\u2019. This AI system is trying to stop itRead moreBecause the lice eat sloughed whale skin and damaged tissue, he noted that \u201crather than parasites, they are really what we call symbionts \u2013 in other words, each animal benefits from the other\u201d.The new grooming behaviour could be considered similarly symbiotic. Given that grey whales can live for at least 80 years, it is possible that animals that were alive during the period of hunting have since adapted to benefit from interaction with humans.",

The drifting particles are known as marine snow.Record ocean temperatures put Earth in \u2018uncharted territory\u2019, say scientistsRead moreWarmer waters were in effect reducing the quantity of food that sunk down to the zone, meaning up to 40% of life in the twilight waters could be gone by the end of the century, according to the study, which was published in Nature. Recovery could take thousands of years.\u201cThe rich variety of twilight zone life evolved in the last few million years, when ocean waters had cooled enough to act rather like a fridge, preserving the food for longer and improving conditions allowing life to thrive,\u201d said Katherine Crichton, the study\u2019s lead author and a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Exeter.\u201cAccording to the studies we have done, 15m years ago there wasn\u2019t all this life [in the twilight zone] and now, because of human activity, we may lose it all. It\u2019s a huge loss of richness,\u201d Crichton told the Guardian. \u201cUnless we rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, this could lead to the disappearance or extinction of much twilight zone life within 150 years, with effects spanning millennia thereafter.\u201dWarmer oceans also reduced carbon storage, said Cardiff University\u2019s Paul Pearson, the principal investigator on the study. This is because the \u201ccarbon that is sinking down as part of the marine snow\u201d is eaten mostly by microbes nearer the surface, instead of falling further. Less sinking means a faster carbon release.Crichton said the good part about the studywas that \u201cwe don\u2019t seem to have reached an irreversible point. We can\u2019t avoid some loss, but we can avoid the worst if we control emissions.\u201dAlthough poorly understood, the twilight zone \u201ccontains possibly the world\u2019s largest and least exploited fish stock, and recycles [about] 80% of the organic material that sinks\u201d, according to a UN programme that studies the region.Crichton said: \u201cWe still know relatively little about the ocean twilight zone, but using evidence from the past we can understand what may happen in the future.\u201d Her team\u2019s findings suggested \u201csignificant changes may already be under way\u201d.The study offered three possible futures for the twilight zone: a low-carbon scenario, which allows for a total of 625bn tonnes of emissions from 2010 onward; a medium scenario, which allows for 2,500bn tonnes; and a high one, allowing for 5,000bn tonnes. \u201cIf we get to the medium or high scenario both are very bad news for the twilight zone,\u201d Crichton said.To put the emission figures in context, the University of Exeter-led Global Carbon Budget estimated that in 2022, total global CO2 emissions reached 40.6bn tonnes. Emissions have been close to 40bn tonnes every year from 2010-22, so most of the CO2 in the study\u2019s low-carbon scenario has already been emitted.",

Although many people had a white Christmas, loved ones were kept apart due to road closures and cancelled flights as people were advised to stay at home.Power outages affected multiple states, leaving many without electricity or heating and making contact with friends and family even more difficult over the festive period.Thankfully, this cold spell is coming to an end, as temperatures are expected to rise to about 5C above average across much of the central US by midweek. This fast change in conditions is linked to a combination of a northerly shift in the jet stream, a change in the position of the low-pressure system that was sitting across eastern Canada over the past week or so, and south-westerly surface winds bringing warmer air poleward from the Gulf of Mexico.However, the speed of the change in temperatures may lead to some localised flooding, as snow accumulations begin to melt, creating further hazards and obstacles for locals and the emergency services to end the year.Parts of Europe are also forecast to experience some warmer-than-average conditions over the new year period. Like the US, there will be a northwards shift in the jet stream, which, accompanied by a large area of high pressure over the Mediterranean, will allow warmer, tropical air to take hold over most of the continent.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

You couldn\u2019t miss it,\u201d says Nerida Wilson from the Western Australian Museum. \u201cIt was so huge.\u201dIt was a deep-sea siphonophore, a relative of the portuguese man o\u2019 war, or blue bottles, that bob like party balloons on the sea surface, trailing deadly tentacles through the water. This one was probably a new species from the genus Apolemia, a group that generally look like tangled feather boas.Q&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world\u2019s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth \u2013 and how much there is to protect.\u00a0Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The spiral arrangement is known to be a feeding posture in these types of siphonophores. Numerous stinging tentacles create a wall of death in the water, trapping small prey, including crustaceans and fish.Finding it was one of the chance encounters that are common in deep-sea research. The scientists\u2019 aim was to study life on the deep seabed, and they just happened to come across this floating jelly while their submersible was on its two-hour transit back to the ship, the research vessel Falkor, then run by the Schmidt Ocean Institute.Screens in different parts of the Falkor were transmitting live footage from the submersible. Wilson describes how everyone onboard was simultaneously mesmerised and puzzled when the enormous spiral came into view.

Yet, a siphonophore is a single organism. \u201cIt did have two parents,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cIt was a product of sex.\u201dRather than growing in a more conventional way into a body with organs that carry out different functions, siphonophores consist of individual parts called zooids.

It estimated as few as 30 were living in the wild in Scotland. \u201cThe number of wildcats is too small, the hybridisation too far advanced and the population too fragmented,\u201d it said.Although the cats, which feed on mice, voles and rabbit, have been carefully acclimatised using animals raised in captivity in the Cairngorms, ecologists still worry they face major survival challenges.Local people including gamekeepers, who may fear wildcats could eat grouse and pheasant chicks, have been educated about wildcat living habits.The project has also heavily monitored feral and domestic cats in the release area, with 100 camera traps locating cats, which are then trapped and if necessary vaccinated and neutered to avoid hybridisation with wildcats.The wildcats have been released in the Cairngorms national park wearing satellite tracking collars so they can be carefully monitored and supervised.Dr Helen Senn, the project leader and head of science and conservation programmes for the RZSS, said that eventually wildcats raised or trapped on mainland Europe could be included in the release scheme.\u201cWe hope that this project will pave the way for the full recovery of Scotland\u2019s last remaining native cat species,\u201d she said.\u201cUnfortunately, life is tough for wild carnivores and the sad reality is that some of the wildcats that we release will not survive due to threats such as road traffic. Their survival is contingent on their individual behaviour in a new environment.\u201cHowever, we also know that inaction will result in extinction. As human activity is responsible for the wildcat\u2019s decline, we have a responsibility to take action now to protect one of our rarest and most threatened mammals.\u201dFrancesca Osowska, the chief executive of NatureScot, the government conservation agency, said the project sat within a wider mosaic of species reintroduction and rewilding projects.\u201cA huge amount of work has laid the ground for these wildcat releases, and we\u2019re proud to have played our part in that.

They provide housing, food and areas to spawn for millions of marine species and are the backbone of maintaining the aquatic life cycle.Since the 1950s, more than half of natural coral reefs have been lost to climate change, which has had dire effects on marine biodiversity. Experts estimate that if nothing is done to reduce biodiversity loss, more than a million species globally will be at risk of going extinct.To combat this, scientists have been developing methods to revive aquatic communities. The latest method involved sinking artificial reefs made from pear trees in the Wadden Sea in the Netherlands.A team of researchers built dozens of pyramid-shaped structures made out of felled pear trees, sank them to the seabed and monitored them for more than six months.Jon Dickson, a PhD candidate at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research and lead author of the study published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, said: \u201cWe have fossil records of sunken wood communities dating back to the Jurassic period \u2026 we are trying to simulate what it used to be like. [Because] trees are cheap and waste products, it\u2019s cheaper to scale than using concrete or sunken ships.\u201dDickson and colleagues found that after six months the tree reefs were home to algae and more than 15 sessile organisms \u2013 species that are immobile and typically anchored to a surface, like barnacles on the hull of a ship.They also found that the sites with tree reefs were home to three times more species of fish than control areas without.These findings suggest that certain marine habitats could be recovered through the use of these tree reefs.\u201cHopefully we can push the knowledge that we\u2019ve learned into other similar systems, [such as] in the North Sea \u2026 and help the fish population recover there,\u201d Dickson said.In 2017, researchers in Germany published similar findings after studying deep sea organisms that inhabited sunken tree logs. They found that different species were attracted to the sunken wood depending on the location.Dickson said: \u201cI\u2019d love to do [this experiment] somewhere with clearer water where we can actually visually observe how these reefs are providing habitat for fish and other organisms, as well as elsewhere in the Netherlands and North Sea.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Initially free to visit, the village was enclosed behind a fence with entry controlled through a visitor centre that charges up to \u00a312.50 for adults. However, Orkney\u2019s Ring of Brodgar stone circle remains open and free to all.Ian Fordham, the chair of Urras nan Tursachan (UnT), which owns the Calanais visitor centre and backs the fee proposal, said there was an urgent need to tackle the impact of increasing visitor numbers at the site.He said about 120,000 tourists a year visited Calanais and that figure was expected to nearly double by 2035. They are braced for an increase in daytrippers after a new deep water port for very large cruise ships opens in Stornoway next year.About 120,000 tourists a year visit Calanais. Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianAt present, the site is managed by UnT, which runs the visitor centre, and HES, which owns the standing stones and allows free admission through unlocked gates. They plan to build a larger visitor centre and fence in the site to make it a \u201csingle coherent visitor destination\u201d with an entrance fee.The proposal to merge it into a single site has already been approved by the UK and Scottish governments under the islands growth deal.Fordham said they needed much better management of the site otherwise it would be \u201coverrun in an uncontrollable fashion\u201d by visitors.He said problems at the Ring of Brodgar, which had to be closed for some time to build new paths and drains to cope with its surge in visitors, was a warning of what could happen at Calanais.\u201cWith increasing footfall at the stones, there\u2019s increasing risk of conservation damage, conservation risk to the stones,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has become clear this year that increased visitors numbers are causing conservation issues at the stones, [in terms of] erosion.\u201dMalcolm McLean, a former chair of the UN-linked cultural body Unesco Scotland who has been visiting Calanais for 40 years, said he was \u201cacutely aware\u201d of the need to safeguard archaeological sites but an entrance fee would dismay local people.\u201cIt will be a highly controversial decision on the island,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a community perspective, people see this as a place that\u2019s open and they can come and go at any time.\u201d Many would find it \u201cvery difficult to deal with\u201d if it was fenced in as a paying attraction, he said.The stones are thought to have been a ritual site for about 2,000 years. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThe Calanais stones were erected from about 2900BC onwards, predating the stone circle at Stonehenge, and are made up of a central stone circle to which a cruciform arrangement of stones was later added.Set on high ground, the site boasts views over the surrounding moorland and across Loch Roag on the west coast of Lewis.The stones are thought to have been a ritual site for approximately 2,000 years. A chambered cairn was added about 500 years after the first stones were erected.Some archaeologists believe some of the stones were erected deliberately to align with the midsummer sunrise on Lewis. A theory that they aligned too with the full moon\u2019s movements was popularised by the amateur archaeologist Margaret Curtis, who died in 2020.The admission fee proposal was approved by HES\u2019s board earlier this year and board members said it could set a precedent for other sites \u2013 an indication that charging could be imposed on other attractions. \u201cCareful consideration is required over how the local community is engaged in this process,\u201d the board said.",

One paper, from 2018, suggests orcas near industrialised areas could be at risk of population collapse as a result.For the latest report, scientists examined postmortem records and tissue samples from 1,000 marine mammals, consisting of 11 different species stranded in the UK, using data collected over 30 years by a partnership including ZSL\u2019s Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme, a government-funded project, and the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science.They found that concentrations of PCBs, once widely used but banned globally in 2004 under the Stockholm convention, were highest in long-lived species at the top of the food chain: orcas, bottle-nosed dolphins and white-beaked dolphins.Researchers said they controlled for the bias introduced by examining stranded animals, whose deaths may have been hastened by chemicals, by including a high percentage of deaths from trauma, such as boat strikes or entanglement with fishing lines.Orcas following a trawler off the Shetland Isles, Scotland. Strandings may be exacerbated by high levels of PCBs in their bodies. Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyThe toxins, initially taken up by plankton at the bottom of the food chain and not susceptible to being broken down, increase in concentration the higher up the chain they go, a process known as \u201cbiomagnification\u201d, Williams said.In 2017, Lulu, an orca from the UK\u2019s last resident pod, was found dead on Tiree in Scotland.

The lawsuit alleges the province\u2019s climate plan is incompatible with Canada\u2019s Paris agreement commitments, which Ontario has pledged to uphold.By failing to uphold its climate pledges, the lawsuit claims, the province has violated the charter rights of young people. The lawsuit also called on the courts to require the province to draw up a new climate plan.In her judgment, Vermette found the youth \u201cmake a compelling case that climate change and the existential threat that it poses to human life\u201d are clear and that the province\u2019s climate plan \u201cfalls severely short\u201d of what\u2019s needed to address climate change.But she was skeptical that weaknesses in Ontario\u2019s climate plan violated section 7 of Canada\u2019s Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees the right to life, liberty and security.Vermette also dismissed the idea that Ontario\u2019s plan violated section 15 of the charter, which recognizes the right to equality under the law without discrimination.While she agreed climate change disproportionately affects certain groups, the province was not obliged to fix this inequality through its climate targets.The dismissal is a blow to attempts by young people to hold governments to account, and is the latest lawsuit of its kind to fail.

We have to take this seriously.\u201dFarmers say more than 340 sheep were killed in 2021 by a Swedish wolf population estimated at about 460. The predators, which in the 1960s were thought to be extinct in Sweden, are also resented by hunters, who say the dogs they use to track and drive deer and elk are regularly attacked.\u201cThis cull is absolutely necessary to slow the growth of wolves. Sweden\u2019s wolf population is the largest we have had in modern times,\u201d Gunnar Gl\u00f6ersen, predator manager at the Swedish Hunters\u2019 Association, told public broadcaster SVT.However, the scale of this year\u2019s planned cull \u2013 only 203 wolves have been shot in total in Sweden in the 12 years since authorised hunting resumed \u2013 has alarmed conservationists. \u201cIt\u2019s tragic,\u201d said Daniel Ekblom of the Nature Conservation Society. \u201cIt could have consequences for a long time to come.\u201dScientists have said the that to sustain a healthy population, the wolf population roaming Sweden and Finland should not fall below 500, and Sweden\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency has said at least 300 are necessary to avoid harmful inbreeding.Led by centre- and far-right parties, however, Sweden\u2019s parliament voted two years ago to cap the wolf population at 270, while the Swedish Hunters\u2019 Association wants to go even further and lower the limit to 150 animals.Wolf numbers fell steeply in Sweden after 1789, when a law was passed allowing commoners to hunt. That led to the decimation of the deer and elk populations, prompting wolves to prey more on livestock \u2013 and the state to pay a bounty for every wolf killed.The population shrank to the brink of extinction and the predator was declared a protected species in the 1960s. Numbers began growing again 20 years later, however, when three wolves from the Russian-Finnish population migrated to central Sweden.The European Commission has previously opened infringement proceedings against Sweden, warning that the annual cull falls foul of the EU\u2019s habitats directive since \u201cthe wolf population has not reached a level that guarantees its conservation\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing that Sweden keeps on making these decisions,\u201d said Marie Stegard Lind of the anti-hunting group Jaktkritikerna. \u201cThe commission has been very clear about its opinion that these hunts are, in fact, illegal,\u201d Lind told AFP.This year\u2019s cull began in early January and ends on 15 February, although several regional authorities have already called it off having reached their quota. Experts have said the government\u2019s planned national total of 75 wolves may not be reached.Under pressure from farmers and hunters, the government authorised limited annual culls again in 2010. Since then, the wolf \u201chas become a symbol of the conflict between the city and rural areas\u201d, Johanna Sandahl of the Nature Conservation Society told AFP.",

But just over 4,000 years ago, these lowlands were dominated by dense woods of ancient yew trees.A study of hundreds of tree trunks inadvertently dug up by fenland farmers has found that this woodland abruptly disappeared 4,200 years ago, probably because a rapid rise in the North Sea flooded the low-lying region with saltwater.Remnant trees dug up during deep ploughing and discarded at field edges are popularly known as \u201cbog oaks\u201d. But when scientists from the University of Cambridge sampled the logs, they found more than 400 yew trees, some of which had been 400 years old when they died.The ancient yews, one of the longest-lived species in Europe but today absent from the marshy Fens, were unusually well preserved, enabling the Cambridge team to extract precise information from trunks between 2 and 8 metres long.An ancient yew near Wraysbury in Berkshire, England. Photograph: Steve Taylor ARPS/AlamyTatiana Bebchuk, the lead author of the paper published in Quaternary Science Reviews, said: \u201cA common annoyance for Fenland farmers is getting their equipment caught on big pieces of wood buried in the soil, which can often happen when planting potatoes, since they are planted a little deeper than other crops.\u201cWhen I first saw this enormous pile of abandoned trees, it was incredible just how many there were. But when we got them back to lab, we were even more surprised: these trees were so well-preserved, it looked as if they were cut down just yesterday.\u201dAnnual growth rings within tree trunks contain information about temperature and climate for each growing season. But finding tree rings so far back in time is unusual because wood rots.These trunks, subfossils preserved in the peaty fenland soils, showed up to 400 years of irregular tree rings. Combined dendrochronological (tree-ring) analysis and radiocarbon dating pinpointed the ancient yews to a period from about 5,200 to 4,200 years ago, when a dense native woodland including oak as well as yew covered the Fens.The researchers believe the yews declined as the region became wetter but suddenly disappeared because of an abrupt rise in sea level, which coincides with big climatic changes elsewhere in the world, including a mega-drought in China and the Middle East that could have caused the collapse of several civilisations, including Egypt\u2019s Old Kingdom and the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia.Bebchuk said: \u201cWe want to know if there is any link between these climatic events.

That\u2019s according to a new study, which found that between 25% and 70% of California beaches might be washed away by the end of the century, leaving only cliffs or coastal infrastructure in their wake.The study used satellite data collected over the past two decades to examine California\u2019s 1,100-mile-long coast. Researchers from the US Geological Survey (USGS) used those satellite images, combined with models of climate crisis-driven sea level rise ranging from 1.6 to 10ft, to estimate the shape and position of the state\u2019s coastline by 2100. The amount of sea level rise will depend on how much carbon is pumped into the atmosphere now and in the future.How solar farms took over the California desert: \u2018An oasis has become a dead sea\u2019Read moreThe paper, which is in the process of being peer-reviewed for publication, follows on from a 2017 study conducted by the same researchers focused on the rate of coastal erosion in southern California. That study found a similar fraction of southern California beaches \u2013 between 31 and 67% \u2013 were susceptible to vanishing.\u201cBeaches are perhaps the most iconic feature of California, and the potential for losing this identity is real,\u201d wrote Sean Vitousek, the researcher who led both the 2017 study and the current one. \u201cLosing the protecting swath of beach sand between us and the pounding surf exposes critical infrastructure, businesses and homes to damage. Beaches are natural resources, and it is likely that human-management efforts must increase in order to preserve them.\u201dThe California Coastal Commission is already encouraging cities to harden their coastline by building seawalls or depositing large rocks that can help protect them from pounding waves (though sea walls can cause sand to erode faster from adjacent beaches). Restoring natural sand dunes can also help protect beaches. The study points to several areas at particular risk of severe erosion: Point Arena and Humboldt Bay in northern California, Pismo Beach and Morro Bay in central California, and Newport Beach and San Clemente in southern California.Losing beaches can have ripple effects on the communities that live inland. A study published in January showed that with 3ft of sea level rise, San Diego county would lose a quarter of picnic areas, half of its lifeguard towers, and 15% of restrooms at coastal access sites. That affects lower-income, historically marginalized populations the most \u2013 coastal dwellers tend to be whiter, older and wealthier than the average California resident. Without lifeguards, parking and other amenities, it becomes more difficult for people living far from the coast to enjoy the benefits of remaining beaches.Newport Beach in Orange county was among those deemed particularly at risk of severe coastal erosion. Photograph: Marcio Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez/APThe new study is the first time that satellite-derived shorelines have been used for this type of analysis, says Mark Merrifield, a coastal oceanographer at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, who was not involved in the research. But he warns that the predictions have a wide amount of uncertainty, so they should be taken with some skepticism, he says. \u201cBeach morphology models in general have limited skill in predicting contemporary change, there are few datasets available for validation of the methodology, and projections of future wave and water level conditions introduce another level of uncertainty.\u201dThe beaches that have made California famous are already changing, with a 2009 USGS study finding that about 40% of beaches were already experiencing long-term erosion. Looking forward, the shape and size of the beaches is not yet clear, like a wave in the distant view. More research will be needed to bring the future into sharper relief. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated topic,\u201d says Merrifield.Regardless, the study\u2019s authors conclude that \u201csubstantial management efforts\u201d, such as dune restoration, will be needed to maintain the beaches as they exist today. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty sobering,\u201d Vitousek recently told the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cThis is a slow process when we\u2019re talking about 2100, but it\u2019s not that slow.\u201d",

Plastics have no place in a circular economy and it\u2019s clear that the only real solution to ending plastic pollution is to massively reduce plastic production.\u201dSince the 1950s about 8bn tonnes of plastic has been produced. The Greenpeace report catalogues peer-reviewed research and international studies showing not only that just a tiny proportion (9%) of plastics are ever recycled, but also that those that are end up with higher concentrations of toxic chemicals, multiplying their potential harm to human, animal and environmental health.Recycled plastics, the report says, often contain higher levels of chemicals such as toxic flame retardants, benzene and other carcinogens, environmental pollutants including brominated and chlorinated dioxins, and numerous endocrine disruptors that can cause changes to the body\u2019s natural hormone levels.Waste plastics earmarked for recycling are typically exported from high-income countries to poorer parts of the worldDr Therese Karlsson, a science adviser with the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), said: \u201cPlastics are made with toxic chemicals, and these chemicals don\u2019t simply go away when plastics are recycled.

About 20 million people are at risk of acute food insecurity and potentially famine.The region has been suffering its worst drought in 40 years since October 2020, with extended dry conditions punctuated by short intense rainfall that has often led to flash flooding. There have been five consecutive seasons of rainfall below normal levels.At least 4.35 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, and at least 180,000 refugees have fled Somalia and South Sudan for Kenya and Ethiopia, which have also been affected by the drought.According to a study by the World Weather Attribution group of scientists published on Thursday, the ongoing drought would not have happened without human actions that have changed the climate.That is because a lack of rainfall, but also higher temperatures driven by global heating have made the soil and pasture of the region much drier than they would normally be by increasing the evaporation of moisture from the earth and plants.The study found that the recent rainfall conditions would not have led to drought in a world that was 1.2C cooler, and that by a conservative estimate climate change had made droughts such as the current one about 100 more times likely to occur.Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute for climate change and the environment at Imperial College London said: \u201cThis study shows very strongly that drought is much more than just the lack of rain, and that the impacts of climate change strongly depend on how vulnerable we are. One of the main findings from the recently published Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change synthesis report is that we are way more vulnerable than we thought.\u201dThe low rainfall and high temperatures in the Horn of Africa would also have been less severe without the impacts of the climate crisis, the scientists said. But their study also found that climate change was increasing rainfall at certain times of year.In the region covered by the study \u2013 southern Ethiopia, southern Somalia and eastern Kenya \u2013 rainfall is normally concentrated in two seasons: long rains from March to May, when most of the yearly rainfall occurs, and a further period of short rains, from October to December, with less intense and more variable precipitation.The long rains are now drying up under the influence of the climate crisis, the study found, with low rainfall during this season now twice as likely as before, but the season of short rains is becoming wetter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Five consecutive seasons of below-normal rainfall combined with rain-dependent livelihoods and vulnerability multipliers like conflict and state fragility have created a humanitarian disaster.\u201dThe study was conducted by 19 researchers as part of the work of the World Weather Attribution group, which draws together scientists from many countries and regions, including the UK, the US, Europe and Africa, using established models and techniques to determine whether events can be linked to the impacts of the climate crisis.",

We started with a fairly pleasant June before entering into a wet and windy July caused by multiple consecutive weekend low pressure synoptic situations. A relatively unusual August followed in which we had two named storms, Antoni and Betty, before a pleasant warm spell.Meanwhile, Japan has been under the influence of a heatwave over the previous few months, leading to the country breaking records for both the hottest month and the hottest summer since records began in 1898.After Japan recorded its hottest mean July temperature, with an average temperature anomaly of +1.91C, the country then went on to break the record for the hottest mean August temperature with a mean temperature anomaly of +2.16C. As a result, August 2023 was the hottest month in Japanese meteorological records. The month was so warm that air temperatures in Tokyo were observed to be peaking above 30C (86F) every day of the month, with the lowest daily maximum being recorded at 31.8C on 9 August.This meant the summer of 2023 was the hottest summer recorded in Japan in the past 125 years. The mean temperature for the season, which is based on observations recorded across 15 locations around the country, reached 1.76C above the seasonal average and beat the previous record from 2010 by 0.68C.Last Friday, Hong Kong raised a rare typhoon signal 10 storm warning in preparation for Typhoon Saola, which arrived that night. Maximum sustained winds of 121mph (195km/h) were recorded from Saola while it was about 20 miles (30km) away from Hong Kong. The typhoon died down in its passing but not without causing about 460 flights to be cancelled.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The breadth of the contamination is \u201csobering\u201d, said David Andrews, a senior scientist with the EWG.\u201cIt has taken six decades of research on humans to really understand how these chemicals impact our biology in so many different ways \u2026 and there\u2019s no reason to believe those same impacts are not also occurring in wildlife,\u201d Andrews said.PFAS are a class of about 12,000 chemicals often used to make thousands of consumer products resistant to water, stains and heat. They are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down, and they are linked to cancer, liver disease, kidney stress, fetal complications and other serious health problems.Federal data shows that nearly all Americans\u2019 blood is contaminated with the compounds, but research on wildlife has been scattered until the EWG analysis aggregated it.The highly mobile chemicals accumulate and continuously cycle through the environment because they do not break down, and they can be carried long distances through the atmosphere. That means even animals in remote parts of the world that are far from industrial sources, such as penguins in Antarctica or polar bears in the Arctic, can be contaminated with high levels of PFAS.US military accused of obstruction over cancer linked to \u2018forever chemicals\u2019Read moreResearchers have found about 120 kinds of PFAS compounds in animals\u2019 blood, though that figure is likely higher because limits on testing capabilities make it difficult to identify many of the chemicals.The impact on animals\u2019 health remains unclear, but last year researchers in North Carolina found autoimmune disorders similar to lupus in alligators living in water contaminated by a nearby PFAS plant owned by chemical manufacturer Chemours. Researchers also found evidence of immune system issues in north Pacific sea turtles.\u201cAll this research has been done, yet the next step still needs to happen \u2013 this should be a call for much greater restriction,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cIt\u2019s a clear indication that no more of this contamination should be going out into the environment.\u201d This article was amended on 22 February 2023.

Last week was, preliminary data suggests, the hottest week ever reliably recorded, following a June that was the hottest ever documented globally.More than 100 million people in the US are currently under heat warnings, with scorching conditions felt across Texas and the south-west in recent weeks.

On the other, there is a death-by-walrus that is not played for laughs, Meryl Streep voicing a humpback whale and the opening episode is an impenetrable heap of chaos.Let\u2019s call it a mixed bag. Creator Scott Z Burns wrote the 2011 Steven Soderbergh hit Contagion, which enjoyed a resurgence during the pandemic as people rewatched it to admire its prescience and, as the months wore on, score it for realism. In Extrapolations there is less to get hold of, even though there is plenty going on.The first, wildly convoluted, episode is set in 2037 as crisis talks about global warming are being held in Tel Aviv while forest fires, droughts, riots and refugees abound across the world. Its main purpose seems to be to impart the project\u2019s heavy sense of its own worthiness (I have rarely looked at my watch so much in an hour to see if time was still passing) and to introduce us to the main characters who will recur throughout the series. Also to introduce us to Matthew Rhys, who plays an amoral profiteer and whose agent I suspect needs a word about reading to the end of a script to see quite what\u2019s in store for his client.Kit Harington plays tech multibillionaire Nick Bilton, who holds the patents for various desalination techniques and therefore the fate of millions in his hands.

His career has focused on tracking down wildland fires in savannahs and tropical peatlands around the globe, but his latest investigation was closer to home.It took place on a weekend in early December. \u201cI noticed the familiar smell of wood smoke inside my flat,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019m well aware of its harmful health effects from my research, so I went outside with my portable pollution sensor in search of the source.\u201dAir pollution in the street was even worse than indoors. \u201cAs soon as I got outside, the readings on my sensor jumped. A short walk upwind confirmed my suspicions: the pub opposite my estate had smoke billowing from its chimney.\u201cConcentrations in front of the houses near the pub were even higher than outside my flat. Exposure like this over long periods of time will aggravate the heart and lungs of anyone in the smoke plume. Children, asthmatics and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable.\u201dSmith\u2019s experience is not an isolated example. Last winter, researchers from Imperial College London surveyed wood and coal smoke in gardens and streets. There is further evidence from citizen scientists, including a group of friends who track the smoke that drifts across the gardens and into houses in Chorley, Lancashire.Last month I visited one of the UK\u2019s most advanced air pollution measurement sites, located in the south of Manchester, where researchers from the University of Manchester make detailed measurements of the gases and particles in the air. The roof is a forest of sample pipes sucking air into the instruments below. A laser scans the sky to search for pollution above and another set of lasers create a light curtain to measure rain and fog.Dr James Allan sat down at a computer screen and looked at data streams from the past 24 hours. It was clear that the particle pollution in the city had changed around sunset. During the day there were clear signs of traffic emissions, but in the evening the air contained smoke from home fires.Allan said: \u201cAt night in the winter we see high concentrations of particle pollution. The particles are smaller than 1 micron [a thousandth of a millimetre]. There is a lot of organic particles and black carbon, which we\u2019d associate with soot.\u201dHe explained how his instruments detected wood burning using light of different wavelengths. \u201cSoot from wood burning absorbs more ultraviolet light compared with fossil fuel emissions, and when we compare the daytime to nighttime readings we see this signature. It indicates wood burning is having a stronger influence at night.\u201dRegular exposure has a health impact. A recent study estimated that 284 Londoners a year are dying earlydue to outdoor air pollution from solid fuel heating. It also estimated that about 90 new cases of asthma in children, 60 new cases of stroke and 30 new lung cancer cases a year were linked to this pollution. This is a health burden of almost \u00a3800 a year created by the average person in London who uses a fireplace or stove.Research commissioned by the charities Global Action Plan and Impact on Urban Health used a computer simulation of two mid-terrace houses to investigate the costs of different heating choices. The houses had simulated occupants. One housed a family with two children and the other a retired couple.The neighbourhood health cost from heating the homes with fossil gas central heating was about \u00a325 a year. Adding a wood stove for 20% of their heating took the cost to about \u00a3160 for one of the most modern stoves, or more than \u00a31,000 for an older stove design. This does not include health harm to the stove owners.Dr Gesche Huebner, of University College London, one of the researchers on the study, said: \u201cWood burning is not a solution for reaching net zero or avoiding high bills for individuals. It is not cheaper, not truly renewable, but it constitutes a major health risk.\u201d",

We have lifeguards on WaveRunners that watch over the waters,\u201d he added, referring to a commercial brand of personal watercraft that is a rival to the Kawasaki-manufactured Jet Ski.The first shark bite incident in the latest flurry happened on Monday, when a 15-year-old girl was reportedly bitten on the leg by a shark while swimming at Long Island\u2019s Robert Moses beach. Another youngster, 15, was bitten on the foot while surfing off the adjacent Fire Island, CNN reported.On Tuesday, a 49-year-old man was bitten on the hand while swimming in Fire Island, News 12 reported.In a separate incident, a 47-year-old man was reportedly bitten on the knee at Quogue Village beach, a public beach further east on Long Island, towards the Hamptons. Although a shark was not seen, officials said that the bite mark likely came from a large marine animal.Officials say shark bites have become increasingly common in the past few years. Last year, eight people reported being bitten by sharks near Long Island\u2019s beaches.\u201cThis year, we\u2019ve already had five bites,\u201d said Gorman, and \u201cthe season has kind of just begun.\u201dBut one shark expert said officials must keep the figures in perspective.Greg Metzger, chief field coordinator with the Sofo Shark Research Program in Bridgehampton, New York, told the Guardian that the increase in shark bites this year is \u201ccompletely random\u201d and that shark bite figures remain small.\u201cOut of the hundreds of thousands of opportunities [for shark interaction], only five went bad. So the chances of being in a negative situation with a shark is extremely, extremely small,\u201d said Metzger.\u201cIt\u2019s really just chance and bad luck for those individuals who have had those interactions,\u201d he added.Metzger also said the surveillance techniques being rolled out may not be ideal for spotting sharks, encouraging instead more education about sharks for beachgoers as a way to increase safety.Sharks are rarely at the shallow depths that allow them to be spotted by surveillance, according to research conducted by the Sofo program.\u201cNinety percent of the time that a shark could be there, it would not be at the surface where you could see it. It is not necessarily as effective as people might think,\u201d Metzger said, adding that the ocean waters around Long Island are not very clear most of the time.Metzger added that it is very difficult to identify sharks via methods like drones, even for experts like himself.Recent reports that 50 sand sharks were spotted off the coast of a Long Island beach were \u201cabsolutely, definitely not sharks\u201d,Metzgersaid.\u201cI caution that perception is reality. If everyone is on ultra-high alert that we\u2019re looking for sharks, you\u2019re going to see sharks. They may not be sharks,\u201d he said, adding that people sometimes mistake dolphin fins, bird wings and even beer bottles for sharks.As more lifeguards are being trained to spot sharks, Metzger cautioned that those without shark experience should consult with experts before closing beaches and taking other measures.Metzger said public officials should take similar precautions before rolling out new initiatives.\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that officials don\u2019t consult more with shark experts before making these decisions.\u201d This article was amended on 10 July 2023.

The company is blaming heavy rainfall caused by Storm Babet and Storm Ciar\u00e1n for the discharges.Matt Briers, the chief executive of Chichester Harbour Conservancy, said: \u201cWater quality sampling in the harbour has confirmed increased levels of pollution following recent heavy rainfall.\u201cThis highlights the inability of local infrastructure to cope and the critical importance for urgent improvements to infrastructure essential in preventing pollution entering the harbour from storm overflow and runoff.\u201dBriers said the conservancy group would continue to push for tighter control of pollution in the sea that was fit for a protected natural landscape.He said the group was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about the impact of pollution in the harbour resulting from human activity. This can range from sewage entering the harbour water but also microplastics, chemicals and nitrates.\u201cThe harbour AONB is one of the most important sites for wildlife in the UK. Already threatened, its protected habitats were assessed to be in an \u2018unfavourable declining\u2019 condition in 2021,\u201d he said. \u201cGood water quality is essential for the health of the harbour; particularly for the wildlife that depend on it.\u201dChichester harbour is one of three harbours where Southern Water is spending \u00a372m on treating more wastewater and reducing storm overflows to help the natural habitats.SOS Whitstable also highlighted that during a similar time period, two outfalls in Sandown, Isle of Wight, had more than 1,380 hours combined spillage time.Storm Babet hit the UK on 18-20 October, with the Met Office recording the three-day period as the third wettest for England and Wales since 1891.Storm Ciar\u00e1n followed from 1-2 November, causing a major incident in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight as it worsened existing flooding problems.\u201cThe astonishing length of the sewage releases \u2026 will have a devastating environmental effect on these areas and, despite the heavy rainfall in recent weeks, there can be absolutely no justification over this level of water pollution,\u201d said Acteson.\u201cStorm overflows are supposed to be used in exceptional circumstances to ease pressure on the sewage network. How could anybody seriously claim that a month of consecutive sewage pollution is \u2018exceptional\u2019?\u201dA spokesperson for Southern Water said: \u201cWe agree with campaigners and our customers that storm overflow releases are not acceptable and that\u2019s why reducing this is our top priority.\u201dExplaining the cause of these specific incidents, the spokesperson added: \u201cThese longer releases are as a result of weeks of heavy rainfall, where either surface water is running off already saturated ground into our sewers, or groundwater is forcing its way into our pipes as pressure builds.\u201d",

        "text": "An increasing number of research studies are showing that low emission zones (LEZs) improve health.More than 320 zones are operating across the UK, Europe and notably in Tokyo, Japan. These reduce air pollution across an area by curbing the number of highly polluting vehicles, normally older diesels. Schemes, including London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone, can improve air quality. This should lead to improved health, but does this actually happen?A new review, published in the Lancet Public Health journal, has gathered research on schemes in cities around the world. Rosemary Chamberlain, from Imperial College London, who was part of the review team, said: \u201cWe wanted to bring together the most up-to-date studies from LEZs globally, to understand their effectiveness and to inform future plans to address air pollution.\u201dLEZs are not the same everywhere, making them hard to compare. Some apply to lorries and buses only, while others also include taxis, cars and motorcycles. The health researchers in each country also used different approaches and different data sources. The studies compared data before and after the LEZ start date and some also made comparisons with areas with no LEZ. Data came from health survey results, GP and hospital records, and death registrations.Despite these differences in approach, five of the eight LEZ studies showed a clear reduction in heart and circulatory problems when an LEZ was implemented. These included fewer admissions to hospital, fewer deaths from heart attacks and strokes, and fewer people with blood pressure problems. These results came from zones in Germany, Japan and the UK. One of the German studies analysed hospital data from 69 cities with LEZs. It found a 2%-3% reduction in heart problems and 7%-12% reduction in stroke. The improvements were greatest for older people and resulted in estimated health cost savings of \u20ac4.4bn (\u00a33.8bn).Not all studies found the same results. Five studies, again covering zones in Germany, Japan and the UK, looked at breathing and lung problems. Two found improvements and the remainder showed no definite result. None showed a clear deterioration.Chamberlain explained: \u201cThis review shows that LEZs are able to improve health outcomes linked to air pollution, with the evidence being most consistent for cardiovascular disease, such as heart disease and strokes. It is, however, too soon to fully judge the long-term benefits.\u201dThe latest evidence on the effects of air pollution tells us that the health damage from air pollution accumulates over our lifetimes. Cancer from air pollution is the most obvious example, but it also hampers children\u2019s physical and cognitive development and adds to chronic diseases in later life, including osteoporosis and dementia. The LEZ studies were not long enough to show these types of lifetime effect, although two studies on German zones showed that health benefits tended to grow over three- and five-year periods. One study, of the Tokyo zone, detected improvements in lung cancer rates six to nine years later.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Females produce only one offspring every six to eight years.The island of Borneo is divided between Malaysia, the state of Brunei and Indonesia, which controls three-quarters of the island.Staff from a community development organisation carried out the interviews in 2020 and 2021 and asked villagers questions about orangutan killing, such as \u201cWhen was the last time someone in your village killed an orangutan?\u201dResearcher Emily Massingham of the University of Queensland, who led the study, said the reasons for direct killing were varied and \u201csocially complex\u201d.She said: \u201cWe found that killing does seem to still be happening and a lot of it had happened in the previous five years. I was shocked to see 30% of villages had evidence of killing in the last five to 10 years.\u201dExperts said orangutans are killed for several reasons. People may kill out of fear or because the animals are invading gardens or crops.Mothers may also be killed so that babies can be caught and sold for the pet trade or to be trained as performers. Orangutans are sometimes killed if they enter plantations, and also for their meat and body parts.Habitat clearing, including to produce palm oil, has also pushed orangutans closer to human settlements.The study, published in the journal Conservation Science and Practice, also found a village\u2019s proximity to a conservation project had no effect on the likelihood of killings being reported.\u201cWe were interested to know if having a project nearby might make killing less likely, or if it had an impact on people\u2019s attitudes,\u201d Massingham said.\u201cAny killing of orangutans is likely to have a huge impact on their populations because they\u2019re slow-breeding and long-lived animals.\u201dTo gauge social norms, villagers were also asked to comment on what actions they thought others would take in hypothetical scenarios.Massingham said the only legally sound reply to the scenarios would be to leave the animal alone, but only 40% of people interviewed gave that response.One study last year found US$1bn had been invested to try to protect orangutans between 2000 and 2019 on Borneo and the Indonesian island of Sarawak \u2013 the species\u2019 only homes.Orangutans use slang to \u2018show off their coolness\u2019, study suggestsRead moreMassingham and her colleagues suggest conservation projects should work with communities to design approaches to tackle the problem of direct killing, which could be being ignored or downplayed.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of funding going into helping orangutans but maybe not enough going in to communities,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of these villages are subsistence based, so there is a tension there.\u201dDr Anne Russon, an orangutan expert at York University in Toronto, said the research findings were \u201cdisturbing and sad, but absolutely credible\u201d and it was clear that direct killing remained a substantial threat.Prof Andrew Marshall of the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the new research, has been studying orangutans in Borneo for 27 years. He said he was \u201csaddened, but not surprised\u201d by the research findings.\u201cStudying hunting of legally protected, endangered species is difficult. Folks are often reticent to report killings, fearing that they will either be reported to authorities or viewed negatively by outsiders. For these reasons, the results of the paper are almost certainly underestimates of the true magnitude of the threat hunting poses to orangutans,\u201d he said.There was little evidence, he said, of an improvement in fortunes for the species and \u201cwithout new and effective conservation interventions face extinction within our lifetimes\u201d.

Fur and foie gras production are banned on cruelty grounds in the UK but products can still be imported. Foie gras is produced when geese and ducks are prevented from exercising and force-fed so that their livers grow abnormally fat.Goldsmith recently likened the production of the delicacy to assaulting a household pet, tweeting: \u201cIt should be banned everywhere.

They are now common across the north-east. In New York, red splats, from eager lanternfly stompers, are a frequent sight on sidewalks.The population is seemingly down in some of the areas where they\u2019ve been established the longest, like south-eastern Pennsylvania.

The lanternfly\u2019s food of choice is tree of heaven, a plant that is also invasive.It has a higher concentration of sugars in its roots compared with trees like red maples, river birches and willows, making it attractive to the insect. \u201cIt\u2019s where they get all their energy,\u201d Hoover said. The state is currently on a mission to eradicate the tree.While lanternfly sightings and surveys in Pennsylvania tallied roughly 9,000 insects in 2017, soaring to 150,000 in 2019, there has been a drastic drop in recent years. Some 61,000 were found in 2021, the latest year for which state data is available.Scientists are split on the significance of these findings.Spotted lanternfly egg mass seen in Pennsylvania.

Stomping is still worthwhile, experts said, not least because it can prevent females from reproducing.\u201cIt\u2019s good to do that because every single one of them can lay 30 to 60 eggs,\u201d said Cecilia Sequeira, a spokesperson for the US Department of Agriculture. \u201cAnd every time you stomp one out that\u2019s one more that isn\u2019t reproducing. Every little bit helps; it is a very prolific pest and we\u2019re probably their biggest natural enemies. It\u2019s pretty important that people do their part.\u201dFemale spotted lanternflies typically start to lay their eggs in late August through November, or until the first frost. While the adults freeze to death in the winter, their egg masses can survive. Spotted lanternflies can lay their eggs on a variety of surfaces, including tree trunks, telephone poles, rocks and the undercarriage of vehicles.

The same restriction has been placed on other Insulate Britain defendants in previous trials for public nuisance relating to peaceful protests taken as part of the group\u2019s campaign for better insulation in UK homes.Redfern, 58, Reding, 50 and Rennie-Nash, 71, were found guilty of public nuisance by the jury on Monday. The three had been part of a demonstration at Bishopsgate in the City of London on 25 October 2021 in which they sat down and blockaded traffic.David Matthew, prosecuting, told the jury the demonstrators were removed after two hours. The whole area was reopened an hour later after experts cleared solvents from the streets which had been used to remove the superglue with which some demonstrators glued themselves to the road.Matthew said: \u201cThere are about 255 buses an hour running through Bishopsgate. Over a protest lasting for two hours there would have been several thousand people whose bus journey was affected.\u201dThe blockade was part of Insulate Britain\u2019s campaign to demand a national programme to insulate all homes by 2030.Judge Reid imposed restrictions on what the trio were able to say in their defence. They were prevented from talking about what had motivated them to take action, including a ban on talking about the climate crisis, insulation or fuel poverty. They were also prevented from talking about the civil rights movement in the US.Defendants in six criminal trials for Insulate Britain action have all been restricted from talking about the climate emergency, as a result of rulings by Reid. He told the jury on Monday: \u201cEach defendant acted in the way they did because they felt it was necessary to do so to further their protests. I did not allow you to hear about their motivation because it wasn\u2019t relevant.\u201dOne Insulate Britain activist who ignored the judge\u2019s restriction and explained his motivation to the jury in a previous trial has been jailed for eight weeks for contempt of court.David Nixon, a care worker from Barnsley, told the jury: \u201cYou\u2019ve not been able to hear these truths because this court has not allowed me to say them. Our safety is at risk, our society is at risk.\u201dHe said later at his contempt hearing he found the inability to tell the jury why he had taken part in the protest \u201csoul-destroying\u201d.\u201cIf London continues to flood, [if there are more] wildfires, 40C heat, these are decisions that you are having to live with and I \u2013 this is going to sound completely unapologetic \u2013 I have seen what\u2019s happened in the past week.

Sand from the island originates as far as central New South Wales, travelling 1,500km north along the east coast of Australia.\u201cThe longshore drift process picks up sand grains and transports them to K\u2019gari and along the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast,\u201d Moss said. \u201cThat\u2019s a really important aspect of creating south-east Queensland environment.\u201dK\u2019gari and the dune fields acted as a barrier to this longshore drift process, enabling reef growth, the study\u2019s authors suggest.The researchers dated the age of the dunes on K\u2019gari using two techniques: optically stimulated luminescence and palaeomagnetic dating.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even if they did find the spot, they would almost certainly be disappointed as vanishingly few mussels actually produce pearls.Adult pearl mussels grow up to 14cm long and like clean, fast-flowing water. Photograph: Natural Resources Wales\u201cThey are fabulous things,\u201d said Tristan Hatton-Ellis, a freshwater ecologist with NRW. \u201cWe are hoping that putting back the riverbed will be massive not just for the pearl mussels but for salmon, trout and invertebrates.\u201dOnly about 1,000 ageing adults survive in the wild in Wales. The adults, which are up to 14cm long, like clean, fast-flowing water. They produce glochidia (the larval stage), which attach to the gills of salmon or trout. Then as juveniles they spend up to 10 years buried in river gravels, but none have reached maturity in recent years.Their complicated life cycle means they need rivers with a diverse flow of water, but human activity such as dredging, building embankments and draining the nearby land has degraded the features that pearl mussels thrive in.Over a period of six months, more than 850 tonnes of boulders and cobbles were carefully placed back into the river in Gwynedd along with more than 330 tonnes of fresh gravel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Now, not so much.This means many eco-friendly MPs \u2013 and there are a few \u2013 have simply stayed at home, and those who are here seem to be feeling depressed. After Coutinho attacked those who \u201cview net zero as a religion\u201d she turned up to a Conservative Environment Network (CEN) event to remind them she is a member. The reception was muted, and those present were jokingly referring to themselves as \u201cnet zero zealots\u201d.UK net zero policies: what has Rishi Sunak scrapped?Read moreThe former Cop26 president Alok Sharma came to Manchester to make the case for net zero to a group of businesses and Labour\u2019s Andy Burnham at a green summit, but has been conspicuously absent so far from the conference hall. It\u2019s just as well \u2013 he has been critical of recent moves to water down environmental protections.Sam Hall, the leader of CEN, who has arguably done more than almost anyone else to keep the Tories united on net zero, put on a brave face, telling the Guardian \u201cmuch of the actual policies haven\u2019t changed, just the rhetoric around net zero\u201d, but even he described the rhetoric as \u201cunhelpful\u201d. Hall added: \u201cWe need a positive case for net zero to combat Labour\u2019s environmental narrative at the election\u201d. So far, Coutinho has stuck to implying the Labour party wants to implement a meat tax.The former Boris Johnson environment adviser Sam Richards now runs Britain Remade, campaigning for more renewable energy. He pointed out that some polling showed Tories getting just 1% of the young vote, suggesting this change in policy and rhetoric may be short-lived if the party wants to court younger voters, for whom the climate crisis is a top priority.The ever industrious former net zero tsar Chris Skidmore told the Guardian he is \u201cdoing as much as possible\u201d to keep net zero alive.He warned a fringe event: \u201cIt has caused concern \u2013 is the UK willing to demonstrate future leadership rather than roll back [on net zero]? It\u2019s undeniable that investors who are making decisions right at this moment in boardrooms around the country about where to place their investments are all looking for that long-term certainty.\u201dSkidmore also addressed Sunak\u2019s claims that net zero is costing \u201cordinary people\u201d, adding: \u201cNet zero is not a cost, and actually delaying any measures will only cost householders more in additional gas bills, because this has been a cost of gas crisis. Going further and faster on net zero will result in significant savings being made, and that\u2019s where we can deliver to continue to lead in this global net zero race.\u201dTheresa May, the former prime minister who enshrined the net zero target in law, has hoped the green policy, rather than disastrous Brexit votes, would be her legacy.But even she was lukewarm at a CEN drinks reception. She said: \u201cNow, net zero isn\u2019t about a bossy state telling people what to do. We shouldn\u2019t be out there wagging our fingers and saying: \u2018You must never fly again.' You can never drive a car again. You can never eat meat again.\u2019 We do that, we won\u2019t take people with us. And as the prime minister has said, we must take people with us.\u201dBut May did say that net zero targets must still be met, and that \u201cclimate change is the greatest threat to civilisation as we know it\u201d.Smiling thinly, she added: \u201cRemember, we are the only party with \u2018conserve\u2019 in our name.\u201dThough much of the Conservative green legacy has been dismantled, that, at least, remains true.",

But no country is required to provide data on military emissions thanks to successful lobbying by the US at the Kyoto conference in 1997. Leaders removed the exemption in 2015 but made reporting military emissions optional.Military spending has grown by more than a quarter in the past decade, exceeding $2.2tn in 2022. During the same time period, attempts to mobilize funds for climate finance have faltered.In 2009, for instance, rich countries agreed to spend $100bn on climate finance for developing world annually by 2020, but they broke that promise, providing only $90bn for climate finance in 2021.Preliminary data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released this month indicates that the $100bn goal may have finally been met in 2022, but some experts say that assessment is based on inflated numbers. A 2022 investigation from Oxfam concluded that due to wealthy nations\u2019 \u201cdishonest and misleading\u201d accounting, climate finance estimates in 2020 were as much as 225% too high.Even if it turns out wealthy nations genuinely met the commitment, said Buxton, countries should still reallocate 5% of their military budgets. The $100bn number is widely understood to be far below the true need in poor countries; one 2022 report found that developing nations need $1tn per year to cope with the climate crisis.Highly polluting nations will also need to come up with funding for loss and damage in poor countries. The need is already greater than $400bn annually and rising, by one estimate.Countries with the largest militaries \u2013 largely the richest, most polluting nations \u2013 should bear the most responsibility for cutting global defense spending, the researchers say. They place particular focus on Nato, whose 31 members include the UK, Canada and the US, whose military, which is the world\u2019s top-funded, is also the world\u2019s largest institutional emitter.Nato members accounted for more than half of all global military spending last year, and budgets are expected to rise. This year, members made \u201can enduring commitment to invest at least 2%\u201d of their national budgets to their militaries. If that promise is fulfilled, by 2028, the additional funding would be enough to pay for all needed climate adaptation in hard-hit countries for seven years, the researchers calculated based on United Nations data.Increased militarization harms climate-affected countries in other ways, too, the researchers say. For instance, they found that Nato members are currently selling arms to 39 of the 40 most climate-vulnerable countries; 17 of which are already in armed conflict.\u201cIt\u2019s a real perversion: rather than providing support for communities we are actually making the situation more dangerous and more unstable,\u201d said Buxton.Diverting some military spending to climate finance would make the world safer, said Perry O\u2019Brien, climate justice organizer at US veteran-led advocacy group Common Defense.\u201cWe know true national security means protecting people and communities from harm,\u201d he said.",

El Ni\u00f1os are typically marked by increased prevalence of heatwaves, bushfires and droughts, all potentially challenging for the power grid.Such discussions may well feature at a meeting of climate and energy ministers from around Australia planned for this Friday in Newcastle in NSW\u2019s Hunter Valley. The first such gathering of the year will probably get a market update, with projects in the Hunter region prominent in the Aemo report.For instance, the remaining three units of AGL Energy\u2019s 1680-megawatt Liddell coal-fired power station are scheduled to close by the end of next month.The supply gap was meant to have been filled in part by the completion of Snowy Hydro\u2019s 660MW Kurri Kurri gas plant, also in the Hunter Valley.

He joins the former transport secretary Chris Grayling and Simon Clarke, who was the levelling up secretary, in calling for more ambitious climate policies.They will sit on the new steering committee for the Conservative Environment Network (CEN), a group of 159 Tory MPs who pressure the government to improve its green offering. The group was formed a decade ago.The ministers will be calling for Sunak to adopt ambitious policies to unlock more onshore and offshore renewables, improve home energy efficiency, incentivise sustainable transport options, clean up rivers and seas and reward farmers for using nature-friendly practices.In recent weeks, Sunak and government ministers including the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, have criticised the Labour party for its green energy policies and the fact one of its donors also donates to the campaign group Just Stop Oil.There are fears among green Conservatives that despite hosting Cop26 and announcing a range of environmental initiatives, the Tories are in danger of losing credibility on the matter, while Labour commits to policies that include ending the moratorium on onshore wind, and vastly expanding green energy.In addition, the Tories have recently given the green light to a coalmine in Cumbria, which the government\u2019s own net zero tsar, Chris Skidmore, said should never have been approved. Their focus appears to be on the more expensive routes such as carbon capture and storage, and nuclear power rather than cheaper, proven solutions such as insulation and onshore wind.Sharma said: \u201cClimate change is the greatest challenge of our time.

With their personal safety at risk, the two most powerful Republicans on Capitol Hill at last stood up to Donald Trump. In a heated phone call, McCarthy, the House minority leader, fruitlessly implored the president to call off the mob. Senate majority leader McConnell later called the rioters \u201cterrorists\u201d and said Trump was \u201cmorally responsible\u201d for the violence.The climate victories of 2021 that put fossil fuels in checkRead moreBut McConnell and McCarthy soon slunk back to enabling Trump\u2019s assaults on democracy. They were quiet while Trump insisted the 2020 election was stolen and that anyone who disagreed must be purged from public office. They stayed mute as Trump supporters threatened violence against election officials and Republican-dominated state legislatures rewrote laws and procedures to prevent fair voting.McConnell and McCarthy have shamelessly put party ahead of country and ambition ahead of duty, setting up alarming ramifications for the future. Scientists have said for years that humanity faces a climate emergency and only rapid, far-reaching action can preserve a livable planet. On the first anniversary of the 6 January attack, it\u2019s clear the United States also faces a democracy emergency as well. Only rapid, far-reaching action can preserve a government that is of, by, and for the people.The democracy emergency is closely linked to the climate crisis. Each is grounded in a big lie \u2013 that climate science is a hoax, that Trump won in 2020 \u2013 pushed by the same rightwing politicians and propaganda \u201cnews\u201d outlets and embraced with cult-like devotion by Trump\u2019s followers. Left untreated, each threatens disaster. If Trump\u2019s forces do change enough electoral rules and personnel to guarantee victory in 2022 and beyond, there is zero chance the US government will take the strong climate action needed to avert global catastrophe.Defusing the global climate emergency therefore depends on protecting democracy. To be sure, the US is not the only country where anti-democratic trends hamper climate progress. Most of the worst laggards at November\u2019s Cop26 climate summit were countries where authoritarianism is either entrenched or on the rise: China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, India, the US. But the collapse of US democracy would carry especially damaging climate consequences. Slashing global emissions in half by 2030, as science says is imperative, would be impossible if the world\u2019s biggest economy and leading historical carbon emitter refuses to help.How to defuse the democracy emergency is too big a question to answer briefly. President Biden and the Democrats surely must do more; the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has promised a vote by 17 January on reforming the filibuster to pass fair voting laws. A mobilized civil society is also vital. With Trump\u2019s followers trying to install partisans on voting boards across the land, the Atlantic\u2019s Barton Gellman notes that democracy activists can likewise work at the local and state levels to block such skulduggery and ensure fair elections.A free press is foundational to democracy, and journalism must also rise to the occasion with outspoken coverage. Monika Bauerlein, chief executive of Mother Jones, urges the media to treat \u201cthe war on democracy\u201d as the \u201cbig story\u201d of 2022. The Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin says political reporters should \u201cstop \u2026 concealing that only one party is launching a campaign to suppress votes\u201d and \u201cdemand that Republican [officials] defend their participation in the big lie of a stolen election\u201d \u2013 and if Republicans try to dodge, keep asking the question.Aside from Trump himself, no one deserves such journalistic grilling more than McConnell and McCarthy. As the senior Republicans in Congress, they have the stature to oppose Trump\u2019s campaign for one-party rule. Twin profiles in cowardice, they have instead betrayed their oath to defend the constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.McConnell and McCarthy want the world to forget that a year ago Trump\u2019s mob was hunting them down, leading each man to stand up, briefly, for democracy. But the world must not forget. The press in particular must not allow McConnell, McCarthy and most other Republicans to obscure that they are enabling the gravest threat to American democracy since the civil war \u2013 and, by so doing, encouraging a hellish climate future.This story is published as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story.

However, he dismissed the idea that the move would tie the hands of the next prime minister, following reports that the Truss campaign was worried that it was irreversible.\u201cIn the next few weeks, we will announce a government investment decision on Sizewell C where the government formally commits to the project\u2019s financing. It allows the project to raise private capital in the markets. But it\u2019s only at the point of the final investment decision in early 2023 that the government would formalise any equity share.\u201dJohnson\u2019s decision over Sizewell was challenged by a campaign to stop the nuclear reactor being built.A spokesperson for the campaign, Stop Sizewell C, said: \u201cWhatever way you look at it, this is a very dodgy decision. Has it been made by a lame duck PM who is not supposed to tie the hands of his successor, or was it in fact made before Sizewell C was granted planning consent, lending serious weight to our conviction that this was a prejudiced, political decision?\u201cOur next prime minister should call Sizewell C in. There are so many better ways to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money than on a project that won\u2019t light a single lightbulb for at least a decade.\u201dTruss has not stated a clear position on Sizewell C, but hinted last year at concerns about the involvement of China\u2019s state-owned energy company, CGN, as part of a consortium providing funding for the preparatory work at the nuclear plant. She told the Telegraph at the time: \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t become strategically dependent and I think it\u2019s important that we make sure that we\u2019re working, particularly in areas of critical national infrastructure, with reliable partners.\u201dEDF, the French state energy firm, worked with CGN on the first phase of the project for a new nuclear power station to sit alongside Sizewell B, which is operational, and Sizewell A, which is being decommissioned. The UK government is keen to ease CGN out, however, over concerns about Chinese involvement in sensitive assets.Johnson\u2019s government has already put up \u00a3100m of funding this year to support the development of Sizewell C.",

But at the UN climate summit this weekend, Gustavo Petro, the country\u2019s president, committed to stop the expansion of coal, oil and gas exploitation and reorient his nation away from such \u201cpoisons\u201d. Colombia is the first big economy to endorse a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty. This is a sensible, globally significant step \u2013 which\u00a0raises the question of why other carbon-exporting OECD\u00a0members, such as Britain, shouldn\u2019t follow suit.What is crazy is that governments plan to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 that is consistent with a \u201csafe\u201d global temperature rise of 1.5C. The paradox the treaty seeks to address is that the Paris agreement does not mention the fossil fuels responsible for global heating. But a handful of nations could show how phasing out fossil fuels can lead to sustainable green development and rebut the absurd denialism of Sultan Al Jaber, the oil boss and Cop28 president. There are precedents: the 1997 mine ban treaty began with few backers, but was later ratified by 164 countries.Humanity is at risk if there is no transition away from an extractive growth model to a greener one. Developing nations, such as Colombia, often run deficits in energy and food while exporting low-value goods relative to their imports. Africa\u2019s largest crude oil exporter, Nigeria, imports nearly all its fuel. Seven in 10 economies import more food than they export. Consequently, developing nations suffer a structural trade deficit that leads to a weakening currency and the need to borrow dollars. Poor nations under such a regime transfer about $2tn a year to rich ones, studies suggest.Developing nations want to replace the current inequitable model of globalisation with a fairer one. This has been done before. After 1945, West Germany was to be a \u201cpastoral state\u201d \u2013 dependent on others for energy, food and technology. But two years later, to keep the country from Moscow\u2019s orbit, it was allowed to industrialise under the Marshall plan. Half the debt accumulated after two world wars was cancelled. Germany was allowed to replace imports with home-manufactured goods that, thanks to generous trade concessions, could be exported to richer nations. Despite recovering from war, the US sent Germany 5%\u00a0of its GDP, about $1.5tn in today\u2019s money.What\u2019s needed today is a \u201cgreen Marshall plan\u201d. But former colonial powers with historical climate responsibility won\u2019t stump up the cash. The world\u2019s poorest countries are paying more than 12 times as much to their creditors as they are spending on preventing environmental destruction. Some resource-rich poor nations are negotiating a place in green industrial supply chains by playing the US off against China. But the Kenya-based economist Fadhel Kaboub is right: the climate emergency needs not incremental but transformational change in the trade, investment and finance architecture.Fossil fuels are today\u2019s weapons of mass destruction, representing an existential threat. There are parallels with 1968\u2019s treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Part of the solution to the climate emergency is to increase the use of renewables. But equally important is to stop the expansion of fossil fuel production, and not just with a vague promise that emissions will be abated in the future. Richer nations that benefited the most from coal, oil and gas extraction should commit to ending, equitably, the era of fossil fuels. Anything else, as the president of Timor-Leste, Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta, says, would be \u201ccrocodile tears\u201d.",

Solar installations increased by 210 gigawatts (GW) this year alone, which is twice the total solar capacity of the US and four times what China added in 2020.The analysis, which is based on official figures and commercial data, found that China installed 70GW of wind power this year \u2013 more than the entire power generation capacity of the UK. It is also expected to add 7GW of hydro power and 3GW of nuclear power capacity this year, said the report.Myllyvirta said the boom in clean energy generation could trigger a decline in China\u2019s emissions from next year despite a wave of new coal plants across the country.\u201cThis is because \u2013 for the first time \u2013 the rate of low-carbon energy expansion is now sufficient to not only meet, but exceed the average annual increase in China\u2019s demand for electricity overall,\u201d he said.\u201cIf this pace is maintained, or accelerated, it would mean that China\u2019s electricity generation from fossil fuels would enter a period of structural decline \u2013 which would also be a first. Moreover, this structural decline could come about despite the new wave of coal plant permitting and construction in the country,\u201d Myllyvirta added.China had 136GW of coal power capacity already under construction at the end of June, with a further 99GW with planning permits. Another 25GW has been permitted since then, according to the research, which would breach a policy pledge made by the country\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, to \u201cstrictly control new coal-fired power generation projects\u201d.China has forecast that its coal power capacity will peak at 1,370GW in 2030, which would require either an immediate end to new coal power permits, or an accelerated shutdown of existing and planned coal plants, said Myllyvirta.The findings support forecasts from energy experts that emissions from global electricity generation could reach a peak this year before a peak in all energy emissions from next year.A report by climate thinktank Ember last month found that the growth of renewables was so rapid that it was close to the rate required for the world to triple its capacity by the end of the decade to meet climate targets.In recent weeks, the International Energy Agency added that emissions from all energy sources \u2013 including fossil fuels used for heating and fuels \u2013 could peak in 2025 before starting to decline in a historic turning point for the energy industry.",

They matched this to flood and temperature data over the same period.They found mortality risks increased and persisted for up to 50 days for cardiovascular deaths and 60 days for respiratory deaths, even after the flooding had dissipated.

Environmental groups gathered a petition of 20,000 signatures to stop its launch.Organisers were told this week that the necessary permits to operate had been denied by the government.The French ministry of the sea told AFP: \u201cThe government\u2019s position is that the development of an artificial island is not compatible with the need to strengthen marine environmental protections.\u201dThe ministry explained that new legislation aimed at accelerating renewable energy development had strict rules about installing any floating infrastructure at sea.\u201cCommercial artificialisation of the maritime landscape, on a coast that is already highly urbanised, in a sea plagued by pollution, is therefore not part of logical and political ecologic policy,\u201d the ministry said.The organisers of the Canua project, who had reportedly raised investment of approximately \u20ac16m and had been planning the project for seven years, expressed their frustration, saying they had respected environmental norms but had become caught up in politics.\u201cIt was made clear to us that we should not wait for this summer,\u201d the project\u2019s founders said in a statement, claiming to be \u201cvictims of a political vendetta\u201d.The statement said: \u201cThis obstruction and political aberration, this denial of rights, leads us to take responsibility for the consequences of the situation and forces us to put an end the contracts of those who trusted us.\u201d About 100 employees, from mechanics to bar staff, were told they were being let go.The project had the support from the mayor of one commune in the area, Mandelieu-La Napoule, where it intended to anchor, but it was notably contested by the head of the broader Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur region Renaud Muselier, a member of President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s governing party. The regional authorities said the 100 former employees would be welcome to work in other bars and restaurants along the coast that were seeking staff.",

        "text": "Ivory imports from hippopotamuses, orcas and walruses will be banned under new legislation to protect the endangered species from poaching.The Ivory Act, passed in 2018, targeted materials from elephants, but a loophole meant that animals other than elephants, including hippos, were being targeted for their ivory.After a consultation, ministers have decided to tighten the ban to include all ivory-bearing species, so these will not be poached to fill the gap in the trade left by the elephant ivory ban.Ministers said the hippopotamus was the species most at risk from the trade in its ivory after elephants, and the other species were already threatened by the climate crisis. They added that continued trade in their ivory could exacerbate these threats and make their long-term survival less likely.The elephant ivory ban faced immense challenges, with antique traders taking the government to court in an ultimately unsuccessful battle to squash the legislation.Trudy Harrison, biodiversity minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said: \u201cThis is a pivotal moment in delivering one of our key manifesto commitments on international conservation.\u201cThe Ivory Act is one of the toughest bans of its kind in the world and by extending greater legal protections to five more species, we are sending a clear message the commercial trade of ivory is totally unacceptable.\u201cThe UK has long led the way in conservation and our ban shows continued global leadership in doing all we can to protect the world\u2019s most endangered species.\u201dIvory is used for ornaments, musical instruments and jewellery, among other items, and animals are poached across the globe for profit in what can be a lucrative market.The hard, white material comes from the tusks and teeth of animals. It consists mainly of dentine, one of the physical structures of teeth and tusks.Charities welcomed the ban. Frances Goodrum, head of campaigns and programmes at the International Fund for Animal Welfare UK, said: \u201c[We] are encouraged by early indications that the ban is having a significant impact on the trade in elephant ivory, yet other species are still poached globally to meet an unnecessary demand for \u2018luxury\u2019 ivory products, including the hippopotamus, walrus, narwhal, sperm whale and killer whale.\u201cWe welcome Defra\u2019s decision to extend this powerful legislation, which will go a long way in cracking down on a damaging trade. Today is a good day for conservation and a step change towards international commitments to safeguard our natural world.\u201d",

        "text": "The right to wild camp on Dartmoor could be under threat again after the supreme court granted permission for a wealthy landowner to bring a case against it.Last year, the Dartmoor National Park Authority won an appeal against a decision to ban wild camping on the moors.Camping had been assumed to be allowed under the Dartmoor Commons Act since 1985, until a judge ruled otherwise last January. It was the only place in England that such an activity was allowed without requiring permission from a landowner.The case hinged on whether wild camping counted as open-air recreation, leading to a long debate in the court of appeal. Lawyers acting for Alexander Darwall, the landowner, argued it was not, because when camping one was only sleeping rather than enjoying a particular activity.After the court of appeal decision, lawyers acting for Darwall, a hedge funder and Dartmoor\u2019s sixth-largest landowner, asked the supreme court to hear the case.Darwall bought the 1,619-hectare (4,000-acre) Blachford estate on southern Dartmoor in 2013. He offers pheasant shoots, deerstalking and holiday rentals on his land.His attempts to ban wild campers from using his estate without his permission sparked a large protest movement, with thousands going to Dartmoor to assert their right to camp. It awakened a land rights debate in the UK, with the Labour party weighing in. The party previously said it would legislate for a right to wild camp in all national parks. However, it since appears to have U-turned on its land rights policy.Lewis Winks, from the Stars Are For Everyone campaign, said: \u201cThe loss of our cherished right to sleep under the stars on Dartmoor ignited a passionate and broad movement for greater land rights in England. This news is confirmation that reform is both needed and inevitable, and will act as a clarion call to all those who wish for generations to come to enjoy these fundamental freedoms.\u201cAs ever, the right to wild camp is emblematic of the fragility of our wider rights in the English countryside, and Darwall\u2019s latest egregious move illustrates the need for greater legal protections for access to nature.\u201cWe hope that the court sees sense and returns a favourable verdict, enabling wild camping to continue on the commons of Dartmoor.\u201dDarwall\u2019s legal team at Landmark Chambers said that the high court held that the words in the act \u201cunambiguously excluded a right to camp on Dartmoor\u201d and found in favour of the landowners. The court of appeal held that it \u201cunambiguously included a right to camp\u201d and allowed the Dartmoor National Park Authority\u2019s appeal. \u201cThe appeal to the supreme court will determine once and for all this important issue, namely whether members of the public enjoy a right to camp on the Dartmoor commons,\u201d it said.\u201cThe supreme court will be asked to consider a number of principles applicable to statutory interpretation which will be of interest to practitioners. In particular, it will be invited to consider whether the court of appeal took sufficient account of admissible \u2018background\u2019 materials (i) in identifying the \u2018mischief\u2019 at which the legislation was aimed and (ii) in considering whether the statutory language was ambiguous.\u201d",

        "text": "A team of researchers has filed a complaint against Tesco, saying its \u201cbiodegradable\u201d teabags do not fulfil that claim following an experiment that involved burying them in soil for a year to see what happened.Dr Alicia Mateos-C\u00e1rdenas from University College Cork (UCC) set out to investigate how well teabags advertised as biodegradable broke down. She buried 16 Tesco Finest Green Tea with Jasmine pyramid teabags in garden soil. However, when the teabags were dug up, they remained intact.She checked them at three weeks, just over three months, six months and 12 months, and found no change. She flagged her paper to two researchers at the UCC\u2019s Environmental Law Clinic, who have now collectively reported the supermarket to a consumer protection watchdog in Ireland.The complaint says that a customer would reasonably expect a product labelled as biodegradable to break down in the open environment within a year, or sooner. The Tesco Finest Green Tea with Jasmine pyramid bags showed no signs of degradation after 12 months due to the type of bioplastic they are made from, according to the complaint sent to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC).Dr Alicia Mateos C\u00e1rdenas tests teabags in the laboratory. Photograph: Courtesy of Dr Alicia Mateos C\u00e1rdenasThe company has recently changed suppliers but the academics argue that the teabags are still made from the same plant-based bioplastic, called polylactic acid (PLA).Tesco said that the packaging clearly states that its teabags are not approved to be disposed of in soil or home composting, but need to be industrially composted (having been put in a local council food waste bin). A Tesco spokesperson said: \u201cWe strongly dispute the claims made in this study and believe that the findings are misleading. The method of decomposing teabags used in the study does not reflect the on-pack advice we give customers.\u201cAll our own-brand herbal teabags have been certified as industrially compostable, which means they can be disposed of in food caddies and council collections, biodegrading with organic matter through in-vessel composting. We do not advise customers to dispose of these teabags in home compost bins or soil.\u201dThe researchers say Tesco should change \u201cbiodegradable\u201d to \u201cplant-based\u201d or \u201ccompostable\u201d if they cannot rot down in gardens or compost bins. \u201cIt is fair to assume that any PLA teabag will not biodegrade in the open environment,\u201d said Mateos-C\u00e1rdenas, from the School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences at UCC, who published a paper on the biodegradability of teabags in Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology. Her findings formed the basis of the subsequent complaint.\u201cThe fact that they come from another supplier is meaningless,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have proven that Tesco is misleadingly selling their teabags using greenwashing practices. We are hoping that the CCPC will urgently act.\u201dGiven that the teabag showed no sign of disintegration after a year, it is reasonable to believe it could persist in the soil for much longer, the researchers argue. If the average consumer has two cups of tea a day, they could have more than 700 teabags in their home compost bin or in the garden after one year. This renders Tesco\u2019s claim \u201cnot only false, but also misleading and unsubstantiated\u201d under Irish and EU consumer protection legislation, the complaint says.The researchers want investigators to look into the broader issue of retailers making misleading claims about materials biodegrading, with such claims being \u201crife\u201d.\u2018It\u2019s greenwash\u2019: most home compostable plastics don\u2019t work, says studyRead more\u201cIt is incumbent upon Tesco and others to ensure that their products live up to their advertised claims,\u201d said Mindy O\u2019Brien, coordinator of Voice of Irish Concern for the Environment, who is calling on the CCPC to investigate the claim to avoid further greenwashing. \u201cNow more than ever, consumers are motivated to purchase a product that appears to be more sustainable. There is no room for false or misleading green claims.\u201dThe complaint follows research led by Prof Mark Miodownik from University College London which found most plastics marketed as \u201chome compostable\u201d don\u2019t actually work, with as much as 60% failing to disintegrate after six months.\u201cThe results do not surprise me,\u201d he said, commenting on this latest research, which he was not involved in.\u201cIf the product hangs around for years before biodegrading, which is the reality for many products labelled biodegradable, they are part of the problem not the solution.

When such credits are sold within offset schemes they in effect legitimise additional carbon emissions that contribute to global heating.In particular there is an inherent flaw in offset projects based on avoided deforestation. In principle the idea of avoided deforestation is sound. Forest owners and forested countries in the global south should be financially incentivised to reduce their deforestation beneath an agreed baseline rate.But to use avoided deforestation as a basis for creating carbon credits lets greenhouse gas emitters claim they are contributing to net zero emissions. In reality, avoided deforestation projects only maintain existing carbon stock capacity in forests. They do not add to this capacity, hence cannot offset additional emissions. Carbon offset projects only make sense when net forest cover is increased. Until that happens, the carbon offset market is not a case of net zero emissions but of zero credibility.David HumphreysEmeritus professor of environmental policy, Open University The shortcomings of carbon offsets also hold true for biodiversity offsets, which have been promoted as a way of saving forests. But there\u2019s a new kid on the block \u2013 biocredits, a new kind of financial asset identified as units of biodiversity that are measurable and traceable and so can be traded and sold to individuals, corporates and government. They can be a positive investment in improved conservation in ways that also benefit Indigenous peoples and local communities.Our research shows that pilot schemes for biocredits are emerging all over the world, but need to avoid the setbacks faced by carbon credit and carbon offset markets, specifically in making sure the metrics they use to define a unit of biodiversity include its social and cultural value. The United Nations is facilitating the development of a standard methodology, as are certifiers Plan Vivo, Verra and Gold Standard. This all bodes well for the rapid implementation of a mechanism with the potential to save the world\u2019s forests.Paul Steele and Anna DucrosInternational Institute for Environment and Development Your article (18 January) cites academics who take issue with highly technical elements of the methodologies used to determine the amount of emissions reductions by projects that avoid deforestation and forest degradation to generate carbon credits. But many other experts support the current technical elements. The article did not fairly represent the views of both sides. Debates among scientists risk being misunderstood and taken out of context by the wider community, with unintended consequences. This is of particular concern when the science is not yet peer-reviewed, as is the case of the research that the article heavily relies on.Achieving the Paris climate agreement\u2019s net zero goal requires the rapid expansion of carbon markets. Carbon credit standards organisations, such as Verra, provide the science-based methodologies that drive quality, action and supply within voluntary carbon markets. All new methodologies are open to public consultation, where scientific input is considered \u2013 and where critics should present their views.Dirk ForristerPresident and CEO, International Emissions Trading Association",

He is responsible for ensuring the water firms make improvements regarding sewage pollution via the government\u2019s storm overflow reduction plan.Anglian Water is one of six companies under investigation by the regulator Ofwat for potential illegal dumping of raw sewage.

        "text": "Labour is having to turn away business leaders who want to attend special events at its party conference in Liverpool next month because too many have applied in the belief that Keir Starmer will form the next government.Party insiders say that a full complement of 200 senior business people have signed up at a cost of \u00a32,520 each to attend a special business forum on the Monday of the conference with Starmer, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves and shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds.Another 180 have been put on a waiting list and will only be able to attend if others drop out. Last year only 130 attended.In a rush of interest that has taken officials by surprise, a total of 300 chief executives and chairs of big UK companies will be attending the conference \u2013 more than did so during the first term of Tony Blair\u2019s prime ministership. Business sponsorship has more than doubled since last year, when it totalled \u00a3200,000, to \u00a3500,000 this year, officials say.Evidence that business is fully expecting a Labour government comes as corporate interest in the Tories slumps, with many consultancies and other companies turning their attentions away from lobbying the Conservatives to trying to make contacts with Labour. One head of a London-based consultancy said: \u201cI think it will be pretty dead at the Tories\u2019 [conference]. People will spend their money on who they think will be the next government.\u201dWhile many business leaders are yet to be entirely convinced by Labour\u2019s policy agenda \u2013 with many wanting it to go further and faster in addressing the damage caused by Brexit \u2013 there is strong interest in the party\u2019s green prosperity plan that aims to learn from the Biden administration through public-private partnership in building a new green economy.Joe Biden\u2019s $369bn (\u00a3296bn) Inflation Reduction Act, directed at zero-carbon energy projects such as solar, wind and nuclear, involves giving huge grants to bring manufacturers of renewable energy products to the US, as well as consumer incentives for purchasing electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps and electric stoves.Labour\u2019s green prosperity plan, led by shadow net zero secretary Ed Miliband, draws on elements of Biden\u2019s strategy, using the power of the state to work with businesses to invest in the industries and resources necessary to achieve net zero, with the aim of bringing down energy prices through the use of more renewable energy and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process.Like the Biden approach, Labour would launch itself on a new course, using state resources, including regulation and subsidies, to attract industries to co-invest with the public sector in technologies for renewable power, the production of EVs and heat pump installation.One senior figure in the renewable energy field who will be attending the Labour conference said: \u201cThe feeling in the industry is that we are just seeing out time with the Tories. They have shown that they are not really committed to the agenda. For Labour, it is central to their economic plans.\u201dLabour has also had to find five new overspill areas within the conference centre in recent weeks for businesses\u2019 stalls after high levels of demand. So far, 287 organisations have applied for space for their exhibits, which is believed to be a record. The party has also decided to stage a special business conference in February in London.Speaking to the Observer, Reynolds said that interest in Labour from business was huge, with companies having given up on the Tories.They were, he said, interested in his party\u2019s industrial strategy, which included targets such as \u201cmaking Brexit work\u201d, reforms to planning to allow more houses to be built, and changes to the apprenticeship levy, enabling companies to spend up to 50% of their levy contributions on non-apprenticeship training.This weekend sees the opening of the TUC conference in Liverpool, where unions will demand more action from the government to solve the Raac (reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete) crisis in schools and other public buildings and put pressure on a future Labour government to look again at plans for a wealth tax in order to better fund public services.Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, the country\u2019s largest union, which represents more than 1.3 million workers, said that in the light of the school concrete crisis and erosion of other parts of the public realm, the next government had to show a different attitude to the funding of public services.\u201cI hope and believe that is where Labour is \u2026 that they don\u2019t always think that you have to go out and cut and slash public services.\u201cWe want the next government to see that public services are a good thing in themselves and are not a drain on society \u2013 that good public services help build an economy, build a community, and help people go out to work and businesses to thrive.\u201d",

        "text": "On a chilly autumn morning not long ago, Annalise Klingbeil and eight others packed into three cars, departing Calgary in the dark as they drove westward towards the Rockies.They were hoping to take in the region\u2019s larch season, when the needles of the spiny trees transform a brilliant shade of yellow.But when they arrived at Moraine lake, the sun still hanging behind Banff\u2019s jagged peaks, their adventure was cut short.\u201cWe got to the parking lot before 6am and it was packed. It was like a tailgate party. People camped the night. Some are eating oatmeal from the back of their vehicles, having their coffee, said Klingbeil, a communications consultant who also runs the popular GoOutside newsletter with her sister, Cailynn. \u201cIt was just nuts.\u201dWith the number of visitors growing each year, Parks Canada recently announced it will ban private vehicles along the road to Moraine lake in 2023 in an effort to ease congestion at Banff\u2019s most popular tourist attraction.The tension between showcasing the region\u2019s natural wonders and preserving them for generations to come is not a new issue for the country\u2019s federal parks agency. In recent years, Parks Canada has closed down certain hiking trails and weighed the possibility of visitor caps to more sensitive areas.But the challenges of administering the park have grown more complicated amid a growing political row between the western province of Alberta and the federal government.This week, Alberta\u2019s minister of forests, parks and tourism Todd Loewen called on Parks Canada to reverse its decision, suggesting the ban would harm tourism, give residents \u201cless access\u201d to the backcountry and mark the end of \u201csunrise and sunset hikes or night photography\u201d.Canadian Rockies and Moraine lake in Banff national park, Canada. Photograph: lucky-photographer/AlamyIn response, Parks Canada said the Moraine lake parking lot is at capacity 24 hours a day, and that while 900 vehicles successfully gain access to the lake each day during the summer, nearly 5,000 are turned away, with drivers often directing their frustration at parks staff. The agency said the sheer demand for parking spaces far exceeds capacity and says it will rely on a shuttle option for visitors.Speaking to a local radio station, Loewen pushed back, suggesting instead that the federal agency build a bigger parking lot.The idea prompted scorn from Klingbeil who pointed out that such a move would be banned by law. \u201cWith this suggestion, he comes across like he knows absolutely nothing about this issue,\u201d she said.She argued that there was an urgent need to ban private vehicles, but also to create a cultural shift when it comes to private vehicles in public spaces.\u201cFor a lot of Albertans, \u2018car equals freedom\u2019 and they see their car as something they go to the mountains in. But if you\u2019re seeing 5,000 vehicles a day, being turned away from this place, like, something\u2019s got to give.\u201dThe row over parks has come amid broader political tensions between the federal government and Alberta, which recently passed a controversial \u201csovereignty act\u201d, which could allow the province to ignore federal laws \u2013 setting the stage for potential conflict with both Ottawa and Indigenous nations.In November, Alberta\u2019s premier, Danielle Smith, said she wanted tourism money generated in the five national parks within Alberta to remain in the province, rather than being used to maintain other parks across the country.But Smith\u2019s governing United Conservatives have a checkered record on parks in the province.In 2020, as austerity measures in the oil-rich province took hold under former premier Jason Kenney, the provincial government announced plans to shutter a number of provincial parks. Alberta also proposed allowing private businesses to operate others parks in an effort to save money, arguing a number of the parks fail to generate significant revenues. The idea prompted outcry and was later dropped.But the future of Canada\u2019s parks, who uses them and who sets the rules, is set to become an increasingly tense issue as the cost of popularity takes its toll on vulnerable ecosystems.\u201cAlbertans love going outside. They love their parks. It\u2019s their church: they\u2019re special, sacred, peaceful and energizing places,\u201d said Klingbeil. \u201cThey love it. But they\u2019re asking, \u2018What about my children? And what about my grandchildren?\u2019\u201cParks Canada needs to make some big changes going forward in order to preserve these spaces for future generations.\u201d",

Analysts expect a more climate-friendly coalition between the centrist Civic Coalition, the centre-right Third Way and the leftwing Lewica parties.The three opposition parties have promised to build more clean energy infrastructure, and to cut carbon emissions more quickly than before.\u201cIt\u2019s a landmark moment in modern Polish history,\u201d said Zuzanna Rudzi\u0144ska-Bluszcz, the head of the Polish branch of ClientEarth, a not-for-profit environmental organisation. \u201cAlthough our spirits are high, we need to remain mindful about the challenges that lie ahead.\u201dCivic Coalition, the main opposition party led by Donald Tusk, a former prime minister and European Council president, says it will move to quickly clean up Poland\u2019s coal-heavy power sector. It aims to generate 65% of electricity from renewable sources and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 75% by the end of the decade, but has not released plans for how to do so.Lewica has also called for a faster expansion of renewable energy and promised to carry out \u201ca thorough modernisation\u201d of the country\u2019s electricity grids. Third Way, which has only a short section on climate in its manifesto, has campaigned for more energy independence with the slogan \u201ca power plant in every home\u201d.Joanna Ma\u0107kowiak-Pandera, the president of the energy thinktank Forum Energii, said: \u201cThere is quite a lot of consistency on energy and climate issues within the parties that are likely to form the government. The level of ambition is also high.\u201dBut the broad coalition may struggle to agree on policies to reach their targets, analysts say, particularly on topics outside renewable energy. They are also likely to face opposition from coal workers\u2019 unions and a president with veto powers until 2025.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In its manifesto, Civic Coalition has said it will freeze gas prices next year at their 2023 levels for households and sensitive customers.Poland, which burns more coal than any other country in Europe, has for years resisted EU policies that cut emissions. In July, the government filed cases with the European court of justice to stop EU rules that would tighten the carbon market, set targets to reduce emissions and ban sales of cars that burn fossil fuels.At home, PiS and its minor partner parties alarmed doctors and scientists with a promise to mine coal until 2049. The International Energy Agency expects rich countries to quit coal by 2030 if they are serious about keeping global heating to 1.5C.But another wing of PiS took a more pragmatic approach, with the partial liberalisation of a de facto ban of new onshore wind power projects that had been imposed in 2016, according to Micha\u0142 Smole\u0144, who runs the energy and climate programme at the thinktank Fundacja Instrat.The government also pushed subsidy schemes for some clean technologies such as rooftop solar panels and heat pumps even as its rhetoric on climate action hardened. Poland\u2019s heat-pump market recorded the biggest growth of any EU member state in 2022, according to industry data, as people in polluted cities ditched coal-burning stoves and avoided gas boilers because of high energy prices.\u201cIn general the transformation is taking place,\u201d said Rudzi\u0144ska-Bluszcz. \u201cBut in declarations, they treat coal as Polish gold.\u201d",

The average between 1981 and 2010 was 18.71m sq km.\u2018Something weird is going on\u2019: search for answers as Antarctic sea ice stays at historic lowsRead moreBut the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) said preliminary analysis suggested the sea ice reached a maximum of 16.96m sq km on 10 September and had fallen away since then.The 2023 maximum was 1.75m sq km below the long term average and about 1m sq km below the previous record low maximum set in 1986.Dr Will Hobbs, a sea ice scientist at the University of Tasmania, said that since April the rate of growth in Antarctica\u2019s sea ice had been \u201cvery, very slow\u201d.\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a big change from the average, but also from the previous record,\u201d he said. \u201cIn May it was pretty obvious we were in for something spectacular.\u201dHe said sea ice losses in the Ross Sea region were likely down to winds that had pushed the ice against the continent, bringing warm air. But weather couldn\u2019t explain why ice was lost around the rest of the continent.The extend of Antarctica\u2019s sea ice on 24 September 2023. Photograph: National Snow and Ice Data Centre, University of Colorado BoulderAntarctica\u2019s sea ice goes through an annual cycle reaching its lowest extent each February and its highest levels in September.Antarctica\u2019s sea ice had been relatively stable until a new record summer low was broken in 2016. Since then, further record lows have been set, including this February that broke the record for the lowest summer minimum.Scientists are still trying to untangle the reasons for the dramatic run of records, with natural variability and global heating likely combining.Hobbs said in his view the \u201cscientific barrier\u201d had not yet been crossed to allow scientists to say with confidence the records were down to global heating. But he said the loss of sea ice was consistent with climate change projections.NSIDC said the losses of sea ice since 2016 were most likely linked to warming of the upper layer of the ocean.\u201cThere is some concern that this may be the beginning of a long-term trend of decline for Antarctic sea ice, since oceans are warming globally, and warm water mixing in the Southern Ocean polar layer could continue,\u201d the centre said in an update.Thousands of emperor penguins chicks likely died last year after the break-up of usually stable sea ice at four of their colonies.Dr Ariaan Purich, a climate scientist specialising in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean at Monash University, said the top 300 metres of the Southern Ocean around the continent had been noticeably warmer since 2016.\u201cBut as to why the sea ice has been so much lower than it has ever been on the record, we still don\u2019t have a good grasp on that yet.\u201dAntarctica may have entered \u2018new regime\u2019 of low sea ice as global warming ramps upRead moreShe said the loss of sea ice had far-reaching consequences for the planet. Sea ice helps protect the land-based ice from entering the ocean, which could push up sea level by several metres.Sea ice also reflects the sun\u2019s energy back out to space. She said with less sea ice, more of the ocean is exposed to the sun\u2019s energy, causing further Southern Ocean warming and further loss of ice.\u201cScientists are worried. I\u2019m worried that it looks low sea ice is the future \u2013 and it\u2019s here now.\u201d",

But, the agency said, more knowledge on cultivation and use was needed.3-NOP, which has been fed to several cattle categories in Sweden and elsewhere, has been approved for use in dairy cows in the EU since February 2022. The chemical can cut methane emissions by an average of about 30% in dairy cows, according to the report, and by 45% in meat cattle.The discovery about the effects of feeding seaweed was originally made by researchers in Australia and works by preventing microorganisms in the cow\u2019s first stomach from producing methane.While some feed additives \u201cappear to have significant potential\u201d, it warns that there is still uncertainty over the long-term effects and factors preventing it from being used more within production systems.\u201cMore research and analysis is required both in terms of today\u2019s marketed products and to develop alternative, future feed additives,\u201d says the report.As a result of its findings, the study proposes that the government commission the agency, along with other authorities, to further investigate the area.Lines of inquiry, it says, should include socioeconomic impact, support for farmers and other stages in the food chain, improved research, innovation initiatives and increased collaboration with the industry.Other potential areas of investigation for \u201cclimate-smart cows\u201d, it says, are enhancing productivity and genetic variations between breeds on how much methane they produce.In 2021, Sweden\u2019s agricultural sector produced 3.6m tonnes of CO2 equivalents of methane \u2013 2.9m tonnes of which were produced by cattle digestion.Emma Carlen, a climate analyst at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, said: \u201cWe believe that this [methane-reducing feed additives] can be a measure to reduce the methane from cattle in Sweden. We don\u2019t have very many other measures that can have this affect within current production level. But we also believe it\u2019s still quite new and there\u2019s still more research to be done before we can really come in with a clear policy measure.\u201dThe extra cost of such measures was a big constraint for farmers, she said, which is why they wanted to look at what financial support might be needed, as well as other measures.Fredrik \u00c5kerman, the co-founder and CEO of Volta Greentech, which is developing a land-based seaweed factory on the west coast of Sweden to make cattle feed, said in its pilot projects across two Swedish farms so far it had reduced cows\u2019 methane emissions by 80% a day.Next year, the company, which started five years ago, is planning another pilot project at a commercial beef farm in the UK.\u201cWe have developed a strategy that makes cows burp and fart less methane emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the additive is included into the cow feed and we have now been able, in several commercial pilot projects, to reduce 80% of emissions per day that the cows emit, which is of course making a big positive impact on climate change and agriculture.\u201dBy installing a sensor on the farm, they are able to measure methane emissions before and after the introduction of the feed, data which is then verified by a third party.The report\u2019s recommendations are vital for the industry\u2019s development, said \u00c5kerman. \u201cTo maintain profitability in the industry, it\u2019s quite difficult for us to sell a product that costs money to reduce emissions if the incentives are not there. So the policy development is very important,\u201d he added. \u201cIt has been lagging behind other industries.",

The average waiting time for an allotment was three years, while residents of Islington, north London, faced a 15-year wait.The local authority with the longest waiting list was Bristol, with 7,630 outstanding applications, followed by Sunderland, Portsmouth, Southampton, Edinburgh and Manchester.Greenpeace said the numbers of applicants demonstrated a desire among people to find new ways to tackle the intensifying cost of living, climate, nature and health crises.The tradition of allotment holding in Britain harks back to Anglo-Saxon times when swathes of land were commonly held for growing food, grazing livestock and collecting firewood, before the enclosure acts, over four centuries, where aristocrats fenced off public land for their own use.The modern system of allotments \u2013 named for small patches of land attached to tenant farmers cottages \u2013 emerged in the 19th century, and at the beginning of the 20th century the Allotment Act imposed a legal responsibility on local authorities to meet residents\u2019 demand for allotments.A spokesperson for the National Allotment Society (NAS) said the steady increase in demand for allotments had been down to the cost of living crisis, the increased interest in \u201cgrowing your own\u201d during Covid, and better awareness of sustainable growing and healthy eating.The NAS campaigns to encourage housebuilders to incorporate allotments in new developments and also works with local authorities to ensure existing sites are properly managed. \u201cOften usable plots stand vacant for periods of time,\u201d the NAS said. \u201cVacancies due to issues with eviction, overgrown plots or lack of access are frustrating for those waiting years to get their hands on a plot.\u201dDaniela Montalto, a Greenpeace UK forests campaigner, said: \u201cAllotment waiting lists demonstrate a huge desire from people to be part of the solution to our broken food system but without access to land, the many benefits of community food growing to people, nature and the climate are being stifled.\u201cThe government must support councils to act as well as take seriously its own role in creating systemic and lasting change to the food system.

But as the country swelters in the heat, commentators and green campaigners have asked why coal and not renewables were used to plug the gap.What actually happened?Late on Sunday night, after a day in which temperatures had topped 30C in some parts of the country, National Grid\u2019s electricity system operator (ESO) requested that the Ratcliffe-on-Soar coal plant be readied to burn coal to generate power. The ESO is tasked with balancing electricity supply and demand. Germany\u2019s Uniper, which owns the Nottinghamshire power station, brought one unit into action on Monday morning, with a second following in the late afternoon to support the evening peak.Several factors had combined to put strain on the grid: the surge in demand for aircon; a fault on the 1,400-megawatt North Sea Link interconnector with Norway that meant the power the subsea cable was carrying to the UK was reduced by half; and planned maintenance at the Torness nuclear power station on the east coast of Scotland, which cut supplies.So the UK is still reliant on coal?No, the fossil fuel is a small and shrinking part of the UK\u2019s energy system. However, fears over gas shortages in the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine forced the UK and other nations to turn to it as a backup over the winter. In Britain, three coal plants, \u2013 Ratcliffe, EDF\u2019s West Burton A and Drax in North Yorkshire \u2013 were paid to be kept on standby amid fears a cold snap and a lack of gas could cause blackouts.Energy mix: how is electricity generated in Great Britain?Read moreIn the event, they were largely unused. In February, the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, asked Drax and EDF to delay their stations\u2019 planned decommissioning, but that suggestion was snubbed. Ratcliffe, meanwhile, is due to close in September 2024 \u2013 the date Britain has committed to end coal-fired generation. One unit at the site that had been due to close in 2022 will now close in September 2024, at the same time as the other three units.How much does switching on coal cost?Industry sources estimated that Uniper was paid about \u00a3500,000 for Monday\u2019s actions. For context, some gas-fired power stations were paid as much as \u00a312m on the tightest winter days.Keeping plants on standby under the winter contingency coal contracts cost about \u00a3400m. The cost of balancing the grid has been in the spotlight in recent months, amid calls for the profits of gas-fired power plants\u2019 owners to be capped.Why aren\u2019t we just turning to renewables?Britain\u2019s wind sector has grown in recent years, and now typically accounts for about a quarter of electricity generation. But wind production slumped in the still conditions of the heatwave, forcing the ESO to seek other options. With the sun beaming down, solar picked up some of that slack \u2013 providing about 20% of power.As Britain has only a small amount of battery storage, there is little ability to hoard that renewable power for use when the wind drops and the sun doesn\u2019t shine. An industry argument is raging over waiting times to connect up renewable projects, including battery storage, which would allow a swifter transition away from using fossil fuels to generate power.How prepared are we for a heating planet?The Climate Change Committee has said that the UK is \u201cstrikingly unprepared\u201d for the impacts of the climate crisis. The independent body said a number of areas needed addressing, including heat-proofing homes, stemming leaks from water supply pipes and preparing for flash floods.For households, this could be mean costly retrofitting, but little official guidance has been issued. The introduction of a government \u201cFuture Homes Standard\u201d is still two years away.\u2018A lot of challenges\u2019: can housing industry build homes habitable in high temperatures?Read moreGuidance for local authorities issued earlier this year said: \u201cPlanning policy across the UK addresses the issues associated with climate change, but action has been delayed, inconsistent and de-prioritised for too long.\u201dGreenpeace\u2019s Ami McCarthy labelled the firing up of the coal units a \u201csign of failure\u201d, adding: \u201cIf our homes were properly insulated, they\u2019d keep us cool in the summer as well as warm in the winter, plus some heat pumps can cool as well as heat homes.\u201dWorldwide, it is estimated that as many as a billion extra air conditioning units will be sold before the end of the decade, driven in part by demand in China and India where both incomes and temperatures are rising, creating a vicious cycle when much of the electricity used to power them is generated by fossil fuels.",

This is almost four times the 6,213 in the equivalent period in 2021, and about two and a half times the 9,369 for June to August 2020.On the hottest day of the year, 19 July, more than 800 wildfires were recorded as temperatures rose above 40C in the UK for the first time, peaking at 40.3C at Coningsby in Lincolnshire. There were also many fires in mid-August, with 600 recorded each day from 11 to 14 August as temperatures reached the mid-30s.The hot weather in 2022 meant that it was likely to be the warmest year on record for the UK, the Met Office said on Wednesday. Meteorologists said this was likely to be a consequence of climate breakdown.London suffered a higher-than-average number of wildfires, with firefighters putting out 2,639 from June to August, nearly five times the number for summer 2021 and almost twice the figure for 2020.A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said: \u201cFirefighters across London worked in very difficult conditions to protect Londoners during the intense heatwave this summer and their heroic actions meant no lives were lost.\u201cThe grass fires are an example of how we are increasingly being challenged by new extremes of weather as our climate changes. We must adapt to this change and are constantly looking at developing our equipment and procedures to meet all the new challenges that we face.\u201dThe north-east of England also faced a large number of wildfires.

But for Janine Bebbington and her friends, Moorside Fields was where all the important things in life happened.\u201cIt was our playground, it was where we went and climbed trees, used the running track from the nearby school, played rounders, explored, kissed people in the bushes, drank cider, did all the things that people get up to in green spaces.\u201dSitting in the middle of three estates in south Lancaster, the five fields have been enjoyed by locals for more than half a century. But plans to ensure that future generations will find delights there have been scuppered by the supreme court. On Wednesday, the court stripped Moorside Fields of its village green status, a ruling that campaigners predict will have major implications for the protection of open spaces across England and Wales.Under the Commons Act 2006, land that has been used for informal recreation for at least 20 years by local people without challenge or permission can be registered as a village green. Once registered, it is protected from development.Fears that the land might be built upon saw the Moorside Fields Community Group attempt to register the fields as a village green in 2008. The group won its case in the high court and the court of appeal. But the supreme court judgment, by a majority of three to two, has reversed the earlier decisions.\u201cThis is a deeply worrying decision as it puts at risk countless publicly owned green spaces which local people have long enjoyed, but which, unknown to them, are held for purposes which are incompatible with recreational use,\u201d said Nicola Hodgson, case officer for the Open Spaces Society, which campaigns for the protection of town and village greens. \u201cWe urgently need a change in the law to ensure our precious green spaces are protected.\u201dThe county council, which owns the land, had objected on the grounds that the fields might be needed for the expansion of the local school. Some parents feared such a move would open up the school playing fields to the wider public, something that constituted a threat to pupil safety. Handing down its judgment in favour of the council, the court also quashed a separate attempt to grant three hectares of a wood in Surrey, owned by the NHS, village green status.Moorside Fields in winter. Photograph: Janine Bebbington\u201cI think that this judgment totally redefines the way we understand land held in the public domain,\u201d Bebbington said. \u201cIt affects every piece of land held by a statutory body, for example by the MoD, the NHS and local authorities.\u201dShe added: \u201cI fear that Moorside Fields will now be developed or sold to fund new schools elsewhere. We are sad for the people of south Lancaster who in time will lose one of the last bits of open space available to them; and we are sad that England will be less green and pleasant as a result of this judgment.\u201dA spokesman for Lancashire County Council said: \u201cOur primary concern has always been to ensure that Moorside Primary School provides a secure environment where pupils can get the best education. This is a really important case not just for Lancashire County Council but for other local authorities and we are pleased that the court has recognised there is a need to protect this land for future generations.\u201dThe ruling is a major setback for open space campaigners who have enjoyed mixed fortunes down the years. A House of Lords decision in 1999, approving the right of the village of Sunningwell in Oxfordshire to register a strip of land as a village green, saw similar applications mushroom across the country.But the introduction of the Growth and Infrastructure Act in 2013 stipulated that land which had been subject to planning applications could not be granted village green status, staunching the flow of further registrations.\u201cThis ruling reflects what\u2019s going on at a broader level in our society,\u201d Bebbington said. \u201cEvery bit of green space has to be available for development because suddenly land is gold, especially to local authorities that don\u2019t have any money. These spaces are community assets that help to keep us healthy and they are very important. They connect communities but they are taking them away from us.\u201d",

Leaders have warned that funding shortfalls were placing lifesaving malaria treatments out of reach of many people at risk, threatening plans to eradicate the disease by 2030.Julio Rakotonirina, the director of health and humanitarian affairs at the African Union Commission, said: \u201cWe need to ensure that we sustain our political commitment and continue to translate these commitments into concrete action. With most AU member states off-track to achieve the goal of eliminating malaria by 2030, much still needs to be done.\u201dAfrica bears the highest burden of malaria cases globally, and accounts for 96% of deaths from the disease, according to 2021 data. Nearly 80% of those deaths are in children under the age of five.As attention paid to the disease has waned, threats such as the climate crisis have added to the problem, experts say. Higher temperatures and rainfall create perfect breeding conditions for mosquitoes.The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as flooding and cyclones, across the continent in recent years further raises the likelihood of mosquito-borne diseases.The Kemri Wellcome Trust in Kilifi led a recent malaria vaccine trial in Kenya that had promising results and raised new hope in the fight against malaria. Photograph: Luis Tato/GuardianMozambique, for instance, witnessed spikes in malaria after Cyclone Freddy earlier this year, and such disasters make it harder for medication and services to reach affected areas.\u201cIt\u2019s a vicious cycle that we have to overcome,\u201d said Dr Michael Adekunle Charles, the head of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, a global platform for coordinated action against the disease.\u201cIf we don\u2019t continue making the connection [on climate-related risks to health], then we are going to lose a lot of ground in the fight against malaria.\u201dMalaria vaccines such as RTS,S/AS01 are being gradually rolled out across the continent. Experts have warned that while the vaccines were a significant breakthrough, they were not a \u201csilver bullet\u201d that would end malaria and there should be no letup in other measures to curb the disease.Treated bednets, for instance, have been the most effective malaria prevention strategy since their introduction in the early 90s, preventing about 68% of cases in sub-Saharan Africa. However, their effectiveness can wane over time due to growing mosquito resistance.\u201cThe mosquito is always evolving, so we need to get ahead of it. If we don\u2019t, it will outsmart us,\u201d said Charles.The group of leaders at the UN called for the establishment of national malaria councils to keep the disease on countries\u2019 development priorities, and for extra funding from the World Bank to tackle malaria.",

The government has therefore set tree planting targets and asked private businesses to contribute in return for funding or as part of a biodiversity net gain plan.However, woodland experts have warned that many trees are dying soon after being planted, as inappropriate species are chosen or they are placed too close together, or they are abandoned and not watered properly. They have asked the government to set tree survival targets, as it is not currently monitored.The environment minister Rebecca Pow, who in her new role after the government reshuffle is responsible for climate resilience and nature, said she was aware of these concerns and was aiming to tackle the short lifespan of too many trees that are planted to meet government targets.Taking aim at housing developers, she said: \u201cWe have examples of it \u2026 where hundreds of trees have been planted too close together, in the wrong soil type, and they\u2019ve just died.

It said: \u201cAlthough the plan for water sets out proposals for reducing water demand, we share concerns that these policies are likely to be insufficient to meet the government\u2019s targets.\u201dClive Hollick, the chair of the industry and regulators\u2019 committee, said: \u201cWhile the government has begun to set out its vision for the sector, our cross-party committee has concluded unanimously that there is insufficient policy or drive to meet the government\u2019s targets. Sadly, the only thing that is becoming clear in the murky, polluted waters of the sewage crisis is a lack of leadership and deep-rooted complacency.\u201cThe government must therefore provide firmer policy detail and greater guidance to regulators, who cannot be left to resolve these huge challenges by themselves. In particular, the government must give clear guidance on the trade-off between much-needed investment and the level of customer bills.

Thousands flocked to greet the huge mammal as he meandered up England\u2019s east coast after his arrival in Hampshire in December.Subsequent stopovers included Scarborough, where the local council cancelled New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations so they did not frighten Thor, who gratefully responded by masturbating. Then he moved on to Blyth, in Northumberland, before heading home to the Arctic.Walruses are rare visitors to Britain and the public\u2019s positive reaction to his arrival is encouraging. Wildlife has never been more under threat and the fact so many people gathered to see Thor has to be treated as good news.As to the reason for his visit, most experts conclude it was caused by climate change, triggered by rising fossil fuel emissions, which is heating the planet and reducing the sea ice cover upon which walruses rest, hunt and digest their food. As Molly Gray, of British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDLMR) put it: \u201cIt\u2019s not very normal to see walruses down here so we imagine it is because of climate change.\u201dThis interpretation is not shared by everyone, however. Indeed, it was flatly rejected by climate change sceptic Matt Ridley in the Times. Everything is fine and dandy in the Arctic, he insisted. Sea ice levels are not badly affected and, far from being a threatened species, walrus numbers are rising, along with those of polar bears. Why don\u2019t you report the good news about the environment? he demanded.Needless to say, Ridley\u2019s assertion is hotly disputed. Yes, numbers of walruses have been recovering slowly since 1952 \u2013 when Norway made it illegal to hunt them. That does not mean they are thriving in a warming climate, says Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change. \u201cIn fact, in 2016, the walrus was classified as vulnerable on the IUCN red list of threatened species.\u201dRidley\u2019s claims that the reduction in the Arctic sea ice has not been significant is not supported by data, which shows a 700,000 sq kilometres reduction over 20 years.Thor\u2019s visit to Britain clearly highlights a shift in the climate wars. Deniers cannot now claim \u2013 without looking idiotic \u2013 that the world is not heating. It clearly is. Instead, they argue there may be some warming but it is having little impact. The world, like the walrus, is doing fine.This claim is simply not true. The planet is changing and all its inhabitants are in danger, as David Attenborough said. \u201cThe lives of walruses, like those of polar bears and seals, are changing.

On 1 November, the Texas railroad commissioner, Wayne Christian \u2013 who oversees the state\u2019s oil and gas industry \u2013 sent a letter to the education board\u2019s chairman, Kevin Ellis, relaying \u201cconcerns for potential textbooks that could promote a radical environmentalist agenda\u201d.Also contested was the inclusion of lessons on evolution \u2013 the theory addressing the origins of human existence which the scientific community supports and religious groups reject.The decision comes despite pleas from the National Science Teaching Association to not \u201callow misguided objections to evolution and climate change\u201d to affect the adoption of new textbooks.The deputy director of the National Center on Science Education, Glenn Branch, said: \u201cMembers of the board are clearly motivated to take some of these textbooks off of the approved list because of their personal and ideological beliefs regarding evolution and climate change.\u201dTexas is one of six states that has not adopted the Next Generation Science Standards in its K-12 science curriculum. The standards underscore that climate change is a real threat caused by humans and can be mitigated by a reduction in greenhouse gases.Texas has seen some of the most extreme effects of the worsening climate crisis in recent years. According to the Texas state climatologist, John Nielsen-Gammon, the summer of 2023 was the second hottest on record, after 2011.In 2021, Texas experienced an unprecedented winter storm that blanketed much of the state in snow, left millions without power after the electrical grid failed, and resulted in deaths.

Another 12 African cheetahs have since been flown over and the plan is to release a total of 50 over the next five to 10 years.However, the programme was criticised by many wildlife and conservation experts, who accused the Modi government of a rushed \u201cpublicity stunt\u201d and alleged that Kuno national park was an unsuitable habitat for so many cheetahs, which usually require vast habitats of thousands of square miles to roam. In Kuno their terrain will be less than 500 square miles.The concerns have been heightened in recent weeks after the deaths of three of the cheetahs still being held in captivity in the fenced enclosure inside Kuno, months after arriving in India. Sasha, a male, died from a pre-existing medical condition in March, another died in April and a female, Daksha, died this month in a violent mating after she was put in an enclosure with two other males.In a supreme court hearing last week, the judges claimed Kuno national park was an unfit home for dozens of African cheetahs. \u201cIt appears that Kuno is not sufficient for so many cheetahs. There is too much concentration of cheetahs in one place,\u201d said the bench of judges.They called on the government to \u201crise above politics\u201d and consider homing some of the cheetahs in other states such as Rajasthan, where the opposition party rules at the state level. \u201cThey need to be protected, they need to be given suitable habitat. Why don\u2019t you explore for more suitable habitat than Kuno?\u201d said the bench.Scientists in India leading the reintroduction efforts have said deaths are to be expected and are not symptomatic of a failure of the project. They said four cheetah cubs had also been born since they were brought to India.But for wildlife experts critical of the reintroduction experiment, the supreme court\u2019s acknowledgment that Kuno is not suitable has come too late. There is also concern that India lacks the expertise to properly handle the cheetahs, especially as they remained in captivity for so long. So far only three of the big cats have been released into the park and 17 remain in human captivity in the enclosure.Ravi Chellam, coordinator of Biodiversity Collaborative, called the programme \u201ca vanity project\u201d and said it was at best creating \u201ca glorified safari park\u201d that had little to do with conservation and could have a negative effect on the health of the animals and on wider conservation efforts in India.\u201cThe deaths have brought attention to much more fundamental problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are the cheetahs being held in captivity for so long? The people who wrote the action plan are now saying that Kuno is inadequate. Why have they brought over 20 cheetahs from Africa if only eight to 10 can be accommodated in the park? What are we trying to achieve here?\u201dIn response to the supreme court, the government representative said a taskforce was investigating the deaths and that other locations were being investigated to home some of the cheetahs.",

After the BBC scrapped Autumnwatch, Chris Packham is launching his own nature show, which will be broadcast for two weeks on YouTube.In stark contrast to the multimillion-pound Planet Earth III, which premiered on Sunday night with 97-year-old Sir David Attenborough narrating, 8 Out of 10 Bats, which begins on Monday evening, is an \u201canarchic\u201d DIY operation that cost just \u00a350,000 and features a diverse roster of teenage and 20-something naturalist presenters.\u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019ve put a band together,\u201d said Packham. \u201cI feel like Malcolm McLaren and I\u2019m trying to steer the Sex Pistols of wildlife TV.\u201dPackham and his stepdaughter Megan McCubbin, the Springwatch presenter and zoologist, will host the live show alongside new presenters including Indy Greene, 18, a conservationist; Christina Sinclair, a Scottish marine biologist; George Hassall, a wildlife gardener and student; and Kwesia, a wildlife vlogger also known as City Girl in Nature.The series will showcase wildlife wonders found in Britain, combining short films by leading wildlife camerapeople with live segments, \u201chilarious props\u201d, audience participation \u2013 and the promise of controversy.Springwatch and Winterwatch are closely governed by the BBC\u2019s impartiality rules, but Packham, an increasingly outspoken environmental campaigner, is free to be as hard-hitting as he wants on his online show.8 Out of 10 Bats will cover environmental controversies including sewage pollution in rivers, protests against the Rosebank oil and gas field and a campaign against the destruction caused by a busway in Cambridgeshire.Packham said: \u201cMegs and I thought, let\u2019s do everything the BBC can\u2019t do, like get 12-year-olds talking about their bird feeder, make sure we do diversity properly, have a 50/50 split of male/female contributors and give all these young film-makers a foundation to show their wares.\u201cWe can be a bit more controversial, we can do a bit more campaigning, and cover local campaigns where people are struggling.\u201dThe show, funded entirely by Packham with the promise of financial assistance from an environmentalist friend, will broadcast from the Dundreggan Rewilding Centre near Loch Ness in the Highlands for its first week, before moving to the British Wildlife Centre in Surrey for its second.The small team making 8 Out of 10 Bats are all paid equally except Packham, who is unpaid. Packham and McCubbin started an online show, the Self-Isolating Bird Club, during the first Covid lockdown, when it gathered a cult following.Packham said: \u201cMy main thrust is making sure all these youngsters have got some space and airtime. A young bloke called Rufus made a film about wall lizards, edited it on his phone and sent it to us. It\u2019s just brilliant. Another film-maker made a minute-long film about what happens to an apple when it falls off a tree.

I can use my knowledge of marine biology and spotlight some important campaigns,\u201d she said.\u201cThere is a green wave. At the same time that young people are becoming disengaged from nature, there is growing awareness that we have to move towards a more sustainable world. We have to help that new generation move into that and give them a bit of hope.\u201d",

Research shows that more affluent people, attracted by the aesthetic appeal of a fire, are driving that increase.However, a growing body of evidence highlights the environmental and health damage caused, with scientists saying that people who burn wood are subjecting themselves \u2013 and their neighbourhoods \u2013 to high levels of the most dangerous small particulate pollution, PM2.5, which can work its way deep into the body, causing a range of severe health issues including heart disease, strokes, asthma and cancer.Last year, a study from Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, found that even \u201ceco design\u201d wood burning stoves produced 450 times more toxic air pollution than gas central heating, while older stoves, now banned from sale, produced 3,700 times more.Another study found that wood burning in homes produced more small particle pollution than all road traffic in the UK.The latest research, carried by Global Action Plan for Impact on Urban Health, found that the perception among the public was often that wood burners at least offered a cheaper source of energy.However, that was only true when wood was sourced for free, the study found. Experts say scrap wood and wood that has not been properly dried or seasoned is even more toxic and extremely harmful to the health of those who are burning it, as well as to their neighbours.Lucy Anderson, the head of research at Global Action Plan, said: \u201cPressures on household finances may be tempting more people towards burning wood because they believe it\u2019s cheaper. But our new research demonstrates that wood burning is almost always more expensive than other forms of heating in the UK.\u201dThe study found that when a household used a newly installed, Defra-approved wood burner for 20% of its heat, the yearly cost, including installation, was \u00a32,028-\u00a32,204 \u2013 24% more than running a typical gas boiler. The cost increased to almost 50% more expensive where a household used newly installed wood burners for 80% of its heat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In all scenarios, wood burners were more expensive than air source heat pumps.With winter approaching, a range of organisations including Global Action Plan, Impact on Urban Health and Mums for Lungs are calling for greater awareness of the economic, environmental and health costs of wood burning.Jemima Hartshorn, the founder and director of Mums for Lungs, said: \u201cEvery autumn and winter, people in towns and cities are exposed to extreme levels of toxic fumes from wood burning.\u201d She said children were often the worst hit. \u201cIt\u2019s vital people are aware of the strong connection between burning wood and the air pollution it causes, which has lasting, damaging effects on people\u2019s lives.\u201dAndy Hill, the chair of the Stove Industry Alliance, said: \u201cKeeping warm is fundamental to human health and wellbeing. When bought in bulk, choosing wood fuel means that consumers have a fixed fuel cost for the duration of the heating season. A modern stove, as well as being highly efficient and low-emission, offers a reliable and completely grid-independent way of heating our homes, something an air source heat pump and many gas boilers simply cannot do. At a time when energy security has never been more important, the peace of mind this gives is invaluable.\u201d",

The regulator added that the opening of the new investigation did not imply it had found a breach of its rules, but it would stand ready to act if appropriate.Drax has received billions in renewable energy subsidies for its biomass electricity while facing growing criticism over its \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d claims and deepening scepticism over the sustainability of burning imported wood to generate electricity.A spokesperson for Drax said it was confident its biomass was compliant with the criteria of the renewable subsidy scheme.\u201cLast year Drax appointed a third party to independently verify the accuracy of its biomass sustainability and profiling data as part of an ongoing process,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cLike all energy generators, Drax receives regular requests from Ofgem and continues to cooperate fully throughout this process.\u201dThe Guardian revealed last year that Kwasi Kwarteng, the business and energy secretary at the time, told a private meeting of MPs that Drax importing wood to burn in its power station was \u201cnot sustainable\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t make any sense\u201d. In a recording of the meeting, Kwarteng also admitted: \u201cWe haven\u2019t actually questioned some of the [sustainability] premises of it.\u201dThe political scepticism followed a decision to oust Drax from an investment index of clean energy companies in 2021 as doubts over the sustainability of its plant mounted within the financial sector.The company has consistently claimed that it uses wood from forests that are sustainably managed, but experts believe there are poor practices regarding the sources of wood and forest management in some parts of the timber industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For game artist and designer Harry Nesbitt who grew up here, this countryside is in his blood. \u201cThere\u2019s something there deep in my subconscious,\u201d he says. \u201cI always want to tell stories or depict worlds that are close to my heart.\u201dNesbitt\u2019s fondness for this terrain is visible the very first time you look at Summerhill, his forthcoming puzzle-adventure game that tasks the player with herding sheep through a bucolic landscape. You\u2019re accompanied by a dog who provides key assistance; you\u2019ll come across intriguing ruined structures, the remains of an ancient civilisation whose culture was centred on shepherding, through which you must guide your growing flock. Nesbitt says these ruins are designed in order to \u201ccontain, funnel, or sort\u201d sheep in certain ways, causing the player to \u201crationalise\u201d and \u201creconfigure\u201d the space in order to progress.\u201cThe analogy we give is the riddle of the man who is trying to cross a river on a boat who\u2019s got a fox, chicken, and some grain,\u201d says Nesbitt. \u201cYou want to keep all three things safe but you can\u2019t carry all three at the same time. So there\u2019s a bit of logical problem solving. I need to get from A to B, and I want to get my sheep from A to B, but we can\u2019t all do it the same way.\u201dBeyond the satisfaction of solving such spatial head-scratchers, Nesbitt aims to evoke gentle mystery, and perhaps even a little awe, through such environments, referencing the approach taken by Fumito Ueda on Shadow of the Colossus and The Last Guardian. \u201cThey have such a distinct vibe and a very deliberate kind of world-building,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t fully comprehend the space that you\u2019re in or what its purpose is. Why is it uninhabited now, and what has taken place here through the aeons?\u201dFor all the pensive stillness of Ueda\u2019s games, they\u2019re driven by the forceful, unpredictable, movement of the gigantic beasts that roam their lands. Summerhill employs a similar juxtaposition albeit on a more modest scale \u2013 set against the picturesque scenery, your woolly friends swell, contract, congregate, and dissipate as one droving motion, albeit with more than a few exuding a wily mind of their own.For the sheep\u2019s group behaviour, Nesbitt and his team sought inspiration in the aerial drone footage of shepherding \u2013 \u201chypnotic and mesmerising,\u201d he says. After the best part of five years prototyping the game in the downtime during other projects, the interactive outcome is a \u201cfun, kinaesthetic, toy-like mechanic \u2026 Something that\u2019s very expressive, very fluid, something you can just play with and watch the patterns emerge.\u201dNesbitt draws a direct line between Summerhill and his two previous titles: the hugely successful Alto\u2019s Adventure and Alto\u2019s Odyssey. Beyond the beautifully illustrative graphics, evocative colour palette, and reflective mood, he sees each of these titles as fundamentally about the \u201cjoy of movement, a kind of expressive motion\u201d.Specific to Summerhill, though, is the idea of connection, both to custom and land. \u201cShepherding goes back thousands and thousands of years and you find it in every culture, in any country on every continent,\u201d he says. Summerhill, then, is about connecting players to the oldest of folk traditions while evoking the weighty relationships that underpin it. \u201cWe want to endear people to the dog and endear people to the sheep so they can feel a genuine sense of responsibility \u2013 the duty bestowed upon you,\u201d he says. \u201cWe, as developers, can gently tug on the strings of those feelings.\u201d\nSummerhill will be out on PC and unannounced platforms; release date TBA\n",

This new paper looks like it is making a very valuable contribution by synthesising the available literatures into a set of concrete recommendations.\u201dGroup leader of the inflammation biology group at the QIMR Berghofer in Brisbane, Prof Andreas Suhrbier, said nearly all humans now consumed \u201ca fair amount of plastic\u201d and it was crucial that more research funding be dedicated to examining its impact.\u201cSadly, the amount of good medical research in this space is very limited. What are the direct detrimental effects on human health of such plastic consumption? What diseases are exacerbated by such plastic consumption? Who in our population would be most vulnerable?\u201cQuestions regarding the health impacts of microplastic consumption are hard to answer without dedicated research funding and some well-constituted studies that establish a causal relationship between microplastic consumption and a disease or disorder.\u201d This article was amended on 3 April 2023 to remove a quote from Andreas Suhrbier that said it was estimated humans consumed a credit card\u2019s worth of plastic a week. He now accepts this estimate is not necessarily supported by the evidence.",

        "text": "The UK\u2019s most senior climate adviser has strongly endorsed Labour\u2019s vow to halt new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea, and slammed the government for failing to show leadership on the issue.John Gummer, who as Lord Deben chairs the statutory committee on climate change, told the Guardian he approved of Labour\u2019s commitment. \u201cI welcome this policy, I am absolutely in favour and it is the right thing to do,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m sorry this is not a common view to all parties,\u201d he added.Gummer, a former Conservative environment secretary in the 1990s, blasted ministers who have attacked Labour\u2019s proposals. He pointed out that the government\u2019s support for new oil and gas exploration ran counter to its stance at international climate negotiations, now taking place in Bonn.\u201cI don\u2019t understand how the government can ask other people not to produce more oil [while supporting new oil and gas licences in the North Sea]. That\u2019s exactly what they are doing now \u2013 asking other people not to do what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.Labour has come under fire over its stance on the North Sea, from the government as well as its own supporters. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, used social media to lambast Keir Starmer, charging him with committing to higher energy bills.The GMB union also attacked Starmer after he last week reaffirmed a commitment made earlier this year to halt the drilling of new oil and gas wells in the North Sea. Gary Smith, leader of the GMB Union, claimed it was \u201cnaive\u201d and would cost jobs.But Starmer has strongly defended his decision, which along with commitments to green jobs, new nuclear power and renewable energy will form the centrepiece of a policy statement to be made in Scotland later this month.Gummer told the Guardian that leaders across the political spectrum should follow Labour\u2019s lead. \u201cThis should be the common view of all parties,\u201d he said.He said it was \u201cnonsense\u201d to claim that new oil and gas fields would reduce energy bills. \u201cThese are new oilfields that will not come on stream for another 10 or 20 years. And when they do, the oil and gas will be sold to the highest bidder. So it will not reduce prices in the UK. The only way you could make them reduce bills here would be to nationalise them.\u201dHe said fears over jobs at risk in the North Sea were also unfounded. He said the UK should continue to produce gas from existing fields in the short term, but future jobs would be in green industries.\u201cI\u2019m in favour of producing more gas now, we need it owing to what Putin has done, but we are not talking about that \u2013 we are talking about new oilfields that would not come on stream for many years,\u201d he said.\u201cThere are vast numbers of jobs to be had in offshore and onshore wind, in solar PV, which are all much cheaper than using oil. The jobs are all there in green industries \u2013 these are new jobs, the oil jobs are old jobs. Trade unions should be supporting new job creation.\u201dGummer said he also favoured building new nuclear power stations, which Starmer has also pledged to support.Before his ennoblement as Lord Deben, Gummer was a long-serving Conservative MP and former environment secretary and minister, under Margaret Thatcher and John Major. He is due to leave his CCC post later this month, and a successor has not yet been named.International negotiations are taking place in Bonn this week and next over how to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. But the government would not confirm to the Guardian whether any ministers will attend.Gummer said a halt to new oil and gas exploration was essential to keep the global climate livable. \u201cClimate change will mean we will not be able to live as we do now, in the very near future. It\u2019s urgent, it has to be dealt with, and we cannot ignore it,\u201d he said.A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: \u201cIn line with our net zero 2050 commitment, we will not shy away from awarding new licences where they are justified, and where they can benefit Britain. While our plans to power up Britain include significant investment in new renewable and nuclear projects, the transition to non-fossil forms of energy cannot happen overnight and even when we\u2019re net zero, we will still need some oil and gas, as recognised by the independent CCC.\u201d",

Despite the earrings, tattoos, missing teeth and bare feet, he is not a pirate \u2013 just a man with an expensive divorce and a public sector job, living in one of the most unaffordable cities in the UK.This month, his mooring in Oxford was hit by the kind of flood described as \u201conce in 100 years\u201d. Except the same thing happened 10 years ago. And three years before that. All along the same stretch of water.One morning, before he was lent some waders, the river was so high that he had to leap from his boat, wearing nothing but a pair of jelly shoes and his pants, and push his bike through the flood water to higher ground. There, thankfully, he could get dressed for work in the clothes he had stuffed into his rucksack. The next day, he was completely flooded in, with a ukulele, three potatoes and some old chair legs to burn if things got really desperate.It is unsettling to have that silty brown tideline creep up the skirts of your city. To walk down streets that have turned suddenly into rivers. To watch the water line slide unstoppably over benches and garden walls and floorboards.While swathes of Oxford were under water, I went out with a researcher, Jamie Clarke, and interviewed people living in the houses over the river from my father\u2019s boat, including a 91-year-old woman called Betty and our MP, Anneliese Dodds. Betty was in the same house she had been in 10 years ago, when Jamie had first interviewed her. Did she, I wonder, think the flooding had anything to do with the climate crisis? Of course she did.It was sobering to hear the way people living inside bricks and mortar were preparing for this sort of weather to happen more often and more violently. Perhaps, after all, it is better to lose your house and end up living on a boat, like my father, than to have your concrete foundations sunk into the middle of a floodplain.

The enormous jaws allow them to swallow whatever prey they happen upon in the vast space of the deep sea, where food is hard to come by.\u201cThe upper and lower jaw are so big that when its mouth is closed and folded up it\u2019s almost half the length of its body,\u201d says Yi-Kai Tea, a Chadwick Biodiversity Fellow at the Australian Museum in Sydney. \u201cThe head is right at the tip.\u201d The metre-long gulper eels live at depths of more than 7km under the surface, although typically they are found in the midnight zone at about 1,000 metres. Their jaws unfold to immense dimensions, like an umbrella.\u201cA lot of these deep-sea creatures are so intractable that they often come with schematic drawings of how they work,\u201d says Tea. \u201cTheir anatomy is so far removed from what is normal, it\u2019s hard to imagine what they\u2019re actually like.\u201dA gulper eel shows just how stretchy its body is.Pelican eels were one of the many deep-sea fish found on a recent expedition to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands in the Indian Ocean, exploring little-known waters around giant underwater mountains. Tea was a fish expert on board, part of the team that slowly dragged a four-metre-long beam trawl net just above the seabed, as far as 6,000 metres down. After four or five hours the net would come back up to the ship and the team would sort the catch.\u201cThat\u2019s the fun thing about being on an expedition like that \u2026 you never really know what is coming up in those nets,\u201d says Tea. \u201cIt\u2019s really just the luck of the draw.\u201dQ&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world\u2019s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth \u2013 and how much there is to protect.\u00a0Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.As well as their massive mouths, gulper eels also have incredibly stretchy skin that can accommodate an enormous gulp of food. A young gulper eel showed just how stretchy they can be, when it was caught on camera in 2018 on the flanks of a seamount 1,425 metres underwater in the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea marine national monument near Hawaii.Inflated with water, it looked like a black balloon with two beady eyes. Then it folded its skin away and swam off with sinuous waves of its snaky body. It remains a mystery what that particular fish was up to. Perhaps it was trying to look big and scare off the noisy, bright submersible that was filming it, or perhaps it was just stretching its muscles. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really knows,\u201d says Tea.Discovered in the deep: the extraordinary sawshark with a weapon-like snoutRead moreThe Cocos (Keeling) expedition was the first time Tea saw a fresh, net-caught gulper eel and witnessed its incredibly black skin, which soon fades in preserved museum specimens. \u201cThey\u2019re so intensely, deeply black it looks weird and fake,\u201d says Tea. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re looking into a black hole,\u201d he says. \u201cThat really blew my mind.\u201dA recent study revealed how gulper eels and other deep-sea fish engineer their ultra-black skin. Melanin pigments are arranged in such a way that photons of light bounce between them, like a ball pinging around inside a pinball machine, and few escape. More than 99.7% of the light that falls on the skin gets absorbed, making gulper eels almost as black as the artificial superblack coatings constructed from carbon nanotubes that suck in light and let next to none back out.Ultra-black skin helps gulper eels avoid being illuminated by their bioluminescent prey, such as lanternfish, which have glowing lights along their bellies. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t want to be seen, it wants to be well hidden,\u201d says Tea. \u201cThe outer blackness of its skin helps it to blend in well in its surroundings.\u201d",

But in the late 1980s it rapidly disappeared, along with around a dozen other amphibian species.Tapia spotted the frog during an amphibian survey funded by the environmental organisation Defensa y Conservaci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica de Intag, and led by Dr Luis Coloma from the Jambatu Center for Amphibian Research and Conservation in Quito. \u201cWhen I was a child, I used to swim in the Esmeraldas River, where I\u2019d see many specimens of Atelopus longirostris,\u201d recalls Tapia. \u201cSo this species was very familiar. When I saw it, I knew immediately it was an atelopus.

She sighted the bird, or possibly two different individuals, multiple times in the town of Sheringham on Monday.Extraordinary numbers were reported in Ireland in recent days, where up to 60 alpine swifts have been recorded so far, according to the Irish Rare and Scarce Bird news group.The previous record for most alpine swifts observed together in Ireland was five. This has been broken twice in the last week or so, first by a flock of seven birds in Dungarvan, County Waterford, and then by a group of nine seen flying together near Dublin, said Owen Foley, an analytical chemist and amateur birdwatcher who helps to run the group.On Monday, Christopher O\u2019Sullivan, TD (member of parliament), tweeted a video of one of the swifts flying in County Cork.The bird news website Bird Guides suggested that a funnel of south-westerly winds had helped to push the swifts towards Britain and Ireland.\u201cIt is unprecedented. Usually we\u2019re lucky to get two or three birds a year,\u201d said Rob Robinson, of the British Trust for Ornithology, who has studied seasonal migration in alpine swifts.He noted that the species had spread further north during the postwar period, with the birds increasingly making their nests in the roof crevices of buildings in Europe, rather than their natural breeding habitat of openings in cliffs or caves. However, he added that no one was sure what was behind this switch in preference.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Such a phenomenon has been documented with willow warblers in England, for instance.Foley doubted that the climate crisis had influenced the present boom in alpine swift numbers and he expected them to move back to the continent to breed.

Fishers also blame EU quotas, before Britain quit the bloc.\nVolunteer and fisher Jonathan Parkin inspects an egg-bearing adult female lobster in the hatchery\nIn the 1990s, there were about 30 big fishing boats in Whitby, but by 2005, there was only one, according to Redfern, who has been a fisher himself. Whitefish such as cod and haddock have migrated north to colder waters. Some of the Whitby boats moved with them, relocating to the Scottish ports of Peterhead and Aberdeen. \u201cThe guys that didn\u2019t want to move, they had to migrate into shellfish,\u201d says Jonathan Parkin, a 43-year-old fisher.A new disaster struck the Whitby fishing industry from late 2021. Lobsters, crabs and other crustaceans began dying off in huge numbers. The cause remains a mystery. Some locals suspect a government project to dredge for a new post-Brexit freeport in the Teesside region, to the north of Whitby. They wonder if the dredging has stirred up chemical pollutants in the seabed \u2013 a legacy of Teesside\u2019s past as a centre of heavy industry.

In the open sea, the survival rate for lobster larvae is one in 20,000, or 0.005%. By allowing them to grow in a protected environment, Redfern hopes to increase that to 20 or 30%.\nA tiny juvenile lobster in a segmented tray \u2013 the aim is to release 100,000 into the sea to help protect the region\u2019s lobster industry for the future\nAs they feed and develop in their hatchery tanks, the larvae are separated when they reach the stage at which, in the wild, they are liable to eat each other.

        "text": "After decades of pollution, chronic underinvestment and presiding over a fundamentally broken water system, water companies in England have finally apologised for the disgraceful state they have left our rivers and seas in and promised to change. But how on earth can we trust them?Of course, we welcome the industry finally taking responsibility and any additional investment to fix our broken system, but the money may prove too little and the apology too late. These companies have had ample opportunity to put things right and invest in their infrastructure. Meanwhile, surfers, swimmers and paddleboarders, from St Agnes to St Andrews, have been paying the price, risking becoming sick by simply entering the water.Looking at the detail of the announcement, it all becomes pretty farcical, pretty quickly. Their apology and subsequent plan is built upon the assumption that ultimately they can get customers to foot much of the cost of the planned \u00a310bn investment through unspecified increases in their bills. This is unacceptable on so many levels. We, the customers, have already paid for the water companies to do their job and deal with our waste. We should not have to do so again, especially in the middle of a cost of living crisis.And it\u2019s clear that water companies have the funds to pay for this investment themselves if they weren\u2019t so focused on lining shareholders\u2019 and executives\u2019 pockets. Last year alone, companies rewarded their chief executives with \u00a316.5m and paid out \u00a3965m to shareholders in dividends. We understand that water companies need to attract investment and talent to these complex jobs, but if they are not complying with their basic legal requirements to treat sewage effectively then nobody deserves to be rewarded.It\u2019s not yet clear whether the \u00a310bn being announced today is enough to restore all of our rivers and seas to good health and keep waters safe. But what we do know is that priority must be given immediately to tackling those overflows that cause the most harm to people and the environment, so that we can end sewage pollution into bathing waters and high-priority nature sites by 2030. Water UK says the plans by water companies in England will cut the number of overflow incidents by up to 140,000 each year by 2030, compared with 2020.We recognise that water companies have committed to increase transparency and make sewage spill data more available to the public, but yet again this doesn\u2019t appear to be a gesture made in good faith. It\u2019s a legal obligation placed on them by a government that is starting to panic in the face of the sewage scandal.When the UK entered the EU we were nicknamed the \u201cdirty man of Europe\u201d. Tough regulation and enforcement helped change that narrative, but the sewage scandal, and our government and regulators\u2019 inability to properly hold the polluting water industry to account, has brought that shameful name back.We demand urgent change now. We are calling for a cap on CEO bonuses and an end to shareholder pay-outs, unless water companies comply with environmental regulations. And we want regulators to properly enforce the law and hold water companies to account. We have had enough of the PR exercises that water users across the UK are now wise to. Thousands have signed our petition to end profiteering from pollution, and communities up and down the country are primed and ready to paddle out to show their frustration at the sewage scandal in our mass paddle-outs this Saturday. If today\u2019s apology is going to be a turning point in the journey to end sewage pollution, and reset the industry\u2019s relationship with the public, it must be backed up by sustained investment, with the money coming from industry itself. Action, not just words, is what is required.The past few decades appear to show that if we give these water companies an inch, they will take a mile, so we can\u2019t be distracted by their pledges to change. Campaigners across the UK will keep up the fight until we end sewage pollution, and we need the government and regulators to uphold their side of the bargain, and hold this industry to account.We won\u2019t be fooled by smoke and mirrors. We will continue to demand better for our rivers, seas, people and planet until we end sewage pollution for good.\nHenry Swithinbank is policy manager for Surfers Against Sewage\n",

        "text": "Some birds have developed immunity to avian flu, according to scientists who say there are \u201cencouraging signs\u201d that the deadly virus could kill fewer birds this winter.The current H5N1 bird flu outbreak, which started in 2021, has been the worst recorded, and is thought to have killed millions of wild birds. Mortality rates appeared to be very high among wild birds, but it was not known how many survived and gained immunity.Preliminary research by a consortium of scientists has confirmed that two populations of seabirds now have immunity. They took blood samples of northern gannets on Scotland\u2019s Bass Rock \u2013 which were hit hard by avian flu in 2022 \u2013 and found that 30% of them had antibodies.Britain is home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s northern gannets, and ornithologists are particularly concerned about the species \u2013 Bass Rock is the world\u2019s largest colony. The researchers also tested shags, and found that about half had immunity.\u201cThis is the first evidence [of immunity] in seabirds,\u201d said Prof Ian Brown, head of virology at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). \u201cIt is giving us insights into populations that we have never seen exposed to this virus before.\u201dThe research was done by the FluMap consortium, which is led by the APHA, and their key findings have been published in Ibis, the International Journal of Avian Science.Turkeys in a barn. Last year, amid the UK\u2019s largest outbreak of bird flu, poultry farms had to keep livestock inside but this year there have been far fewer cases.  Photograph: Nathan Stirk/GettyThe sample size was small: about 30 birds for each population. Brown said it was extremely challenging catching wild birds and taking blood samples (which is partly why it has not been done before). But the findings support observations from conservationists that some birds appear to have acquired immunity \u2013 notably gannets, whose typically blue irises turned black after surviving infection.It is not known how long immunity will last, as avian flu changes quickly, or what percentage of birds survived getting the disease initially. Seabird populations are slow to recover because they typically only have one or two offspring a year, so there are still concerns about long-term impacts.Researchers now want to test other wild birds, especially those living on farms, to find out more about how the virus is getting into poultry sheds. The virus can travel only short distances \u2013 less than 10 metres, researchers say \u2013 so is unlikely to be spread through airborne transmission between farms. This suggests transmission is mostly via wild birds.Researchers are now watching anxiously to see what happens this winter. October is a month of uncertainty due to the influx of migratory birds and the possible new variants they might bring with them.Between 1 October and 28 October 2022, there were 58 confirmed cases in poultry in Britain. This year, there have so far been none in October. Globally, there are very few poultry cases in northern Europe, and a handful in wild birds. \u201cIf you compare that to the same period last year, it is quite different,\u201d said Brown.Centre of deadly bird flu outbreaks shifts from Asia to Europe and AfricaRead moreHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re in a very uncertain window at the moment, and we won\u2019t be advocating any dropping of biosecurity standards. Far from it, because this is a very unpredictable virus and an unpredictable disease. But at the moment, they\u2019re encouraging signs.\u201dThe H5N1 virus has multiple genes that can switch and evolve together to spread the virus quickly into a wide range of species. When the latest outbreak started, it was because changes to the virus made it much deadlier and more transmissible. Recent changes in the dominant strain of H5N1 in the UK suggest it could now be changing to become less virulent.This new finding follows research published in Nature that shows the centre of bird flu outbreaks has shifted from Asia to Europe and Africa. There are still concerns about it reaching new parts of the world, particularly Antarctica, as wild populations migrate from South America.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

On Thursday, his case was transferred to Manchester magistrates court, where he was sentenced to six months.Just Stop Oil has been campaigning since 2022 for the UK government to stop all new fossil fuel production. The campaign\u2019s \u201cguerrilla tactics\u201d were cited by the Home Office when it introduced the Public Order Act\u2019s tough new anti-protest measures to parliament.Police began using section 7 to tackle Just Stop Oil\u2019s protests at the end of October, arresting 60 people taking part in a march in Parliament Square. In a campaign of slow march protests carried out by the group between then and 4 December, 470 of the group\u2019s supporters were arrested 630 times, with about half of those arrests under the new law.A spokesperson for the campaign said: \u201cSection 7 of the Public Order Act 2023, a law drafted by the fossil fuel lobby, was introduced in April by Priti Patel, and covers \u2018interference with the use or operation of key national infrastructure\u2019.

He will pledge to reduce the wait for farmers and landowners to plug their renewable energy into the grid \u201cfrom years to months\u201d.Labour sources said they were happy to fight on the issue after speaking to \u201cso many farmers and landowners who are stuck in the grid queue for years\u201d.Renewable energy companies have to wait up to a decade to connect to the electricity grid. Local farms and businesses are also stymied by the slow connection times, which are the lengthiest in Europe.But there are fears that a new Conservative party internal row about pylon plans will cause Sunak to go slow on his aim to speed up grid connectivity.A growing number of Tories have been raising concerns about pylons, among them the former home secretary Priti Patel, who asked in parliament this week why the National Grid could not be built in the sea.She demanded ministers \u201cbuild an offshore grid\u201d and \u201cpull the plug on these awful pylons\u201d. The energy minister, Andrew Bowie, responded that an offshore grid would be more expensive and result in higher bills for customers, but said he understood the frustration of her constituents.Patel is part of the Offshore Electricity Grid Task Force, a group of 14 MPs who are campaigning against pylons. Its members include Badenoch and the former environment secretary Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey.Badenoch called for ministers to explore an offshore grid instead of onshore pylons, and Coffey said: \u201cWhile I understand, for energy security, the government commitment to provide 40 gigawatts of offshore wind electricity by 2030, I\u2019ve consistently made it clear that it\u2019s essential our precious landscapes and communities are protected by placing the infrastructure in the appropriate location.\u201d She also asked for an offshore grid to be contemplated.Kemi Badenoch is a member of the Offshore Electricity Grid Task Force group of Tory MPs Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PANational Grid said building the grid onshore was four times cheaper, and the Norwich to Tilbury pylon project, which will improve connections for many rural areas, would be more than \u00a33bn more expensive if built offshore.Simon Cran-McGreehin, the head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said an offshore grid without onshore pylons made no sense. He said: \u201cThe proposed grid investments already include coordinated undersea cables to connect up the UK\u2019s vast offshore wind potential \u2013 but at some point those lines have to come onshore to reach customers, otherwise it\u2019s like a ring-road without any routes into town.\u201dGroups of angry constituents are also rallying against pylons. In September, hundreds of people protested in Suffolk over plans to speed up grid connections by building pylons. They complained that their area would be \u201cdestroyed\u201d by the pylons and said renewable energy needed to be transported in a \u201cgreen way\u201d.Chris Venables, the deputy director of politics at the campaign group Green Alliance, said: \u201cIt should be a shared, cross-party national mission to secure our energy independence, and the route to this is through clean, cheap renewable power. Expensive fossil fuels have wreaked havoc on the economy and pushed up bills for millions, so rapidly building out the power grid to accommodate new clean energy is a top priority.\u201cPeople have genuine concerns about democracy in the planning process, and communities must feel the benefit from the energy transition, but we cannot afford to slow down. It\u2019s politicians\u2019 job to broker the deals needed to move us forward, not grandstand with unworkable propositions.

They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth \u2013 and how much there is to protect.\u00a0Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The sighting of Casper was a striking moment for Janet Voight, associate curator of invertebrate zoology at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. \u201cThis is totally new and different,\u201d she says, recalling the discovery.That first glimpse of Casper threw up many tantalising mysteries. Why is it so pale? Most other octopuses have colourful chromatophores in their skin which change their appearance in an instant and act as camouflage to confuse predators.Is this a breakthrough in octopus evolution?Janet Voight, octopus expertEven in the deep sea, octopuses can be colourful, like the purple, warty Graneledone. Some use a cloak of dark skin pigments, seemingly to hide glowing, bioluminescent prey they grab in their arms and thus avoid alerting other predators. Voight guesses that Casper\u2019s pallor may come down to a lack of pigments in its food.Another puzzle is the short arms, although Casper is not alone in having a limited reach. \u201cThe shallower and more tropical you are, the longer and thinner your arms,\u201d says Voight.This trend towards shorter arms in deep-dwelling octopuses doesn\u2019t have a definite explanation. Voight thinks that, rather than stretching out to grab food, they evolved an alternative tactic of twisting their bodies around so that their mouths, on the underside of their bodies, are directly over their food.Scientists have learned more about Casper by scouring five years of archived footage gathered on deep-sea surveys across the Pacific. They spotted dozens more like Casper perched on the seabed, from two distinct species.Unusually, the Caspers appear to lay eggs on tall sponges, rather than rocks. Photograph: MBARI (Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute)\u201cIt could be that they\u2019re fairly common,\u201d says Voight. \u201cIt\u2019s just an indicator of how little we know about what\u2019s down there.\u201dFor Voight, especially exciting were the Caspers with their arms wrapped around clutches of eggs stuck to tall sponges. Previously, she had theorised that seabed-dwelling octopuses need hard rocks to lay their eggs on. Further down, there could be fewer exposed rocks, limiting how deep they can go.Discovered in the deep: the snail with iron armourRead more\u201cCasper showed there are ways around that by finding a sponge stalk,\u201d she says. \u201cIs this a breakthrough in octopus evolution?\u201dThe sponges themselves are attached to rocky nodules that lie scattered across swaths of abyssal plains and take millions of years to form.If other deep-sea octopuses are anything to go by, the female Caspers probably spend a long time guarding their eggs. An octopus from another species (Graneledone boreopacifica) was seen off the coast of California, on a steep escarpment in Monterey Canyon, brooding her single clutch in the exact same spot for more than four years.For now, the pale and mysterious Casper octopuses have not yet been officially named, because all we know of them comes from imagery; no one has been able to collect a specimen to study in detail.\u201cWith an octopus, you really need it in your hand,\u201d says Voight.",

        "text": "An oblivious Georgia homeowner was unaware a huge 3ft tegu lizard had taken up residence under her porch until eagle-eyed children in the neighborhood spotted it and told her, state wildlife officials said.The reptile was a non-native Argentine black and white tegu, the largest of its species that can grow up to 5ft and pose a threat to wildlife and people, the officials reported.They are using the episode to remind Georgia residents of state regulations that came into effect last year listing creatures including the Argentine tegu species, Nile monitors, African helmeted turtles, Chinese softshell turtles, and Indian rock and Burmese pythons as wild.A grace period extends until 4 December for owners intending to keep any of the listed animals as pets to tag and register them, or dispose of them to somebody licensed to keep them for solely scientific, educational or public exhibition purposes.Biologist Brett Albanese, assistant chief of the Georgia department of natural resources (DNR), said the woman was surprised to learn last month from the neighborhood children that a giant reptile was living under her house in Athens.\u201cThis is definitely an example of why we need to regulate these species. They can be difficult to keep and as they grow their owners may not want to care for them or be able to afford to,\u201d he said.Dr Albanese was unable to say if the tegu had escaped or was released into the wild purposely, which would be illegal. But he said the potential impact to the state\u2019s ecosystem could not be overstated.\u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough how important it is to never release non-native species in Georgia. This helps protect native wildlife and prevent the need for additional regulations,\u201d he said.South American species of tegus are not usually known for aggression, but can become agitated when cornered, searching for food or during mating season. They have a sharp bite and their long tails can whip quickly and cause injury.Albanese\u2019s department has made efforts to eliminate tegus, but admits it needs the public\u2019s help. According to state information, populations of tegus exist in at least two counties, Toombs and Tattnall, surviving on the eggs of native quail, turkeys, alligators and gopher tortoises.They also eat chicken eggs, fruit, vegetables, plants, pet food, carrion and small live animals, including gopher tortoises, a protected species.\u201cAs a non-native species they can be killed on private property with the landowner\u2019s permission and using legal methods in accordance with local ordinances, animal cruelty laws and safety precautions,\u201d the department says.\u201cTegus could spread exotic parasites to native wildlife and cause bacterial contamination of crops. Invasives compete with native wildlife for food and other resources. They can cause habitat damage and transmit diseases and parasites [and] prey on native wildlife.\u201dOther southern states experiencing issues with invasive species have also previously enacted similar tagging and licensing laws. In Florida, known for its diverse array of flora and fauna, wildlife managers declared an official \u201ctag your reptile day\u201d in 2021 to counter the growing threat.",

We have paved them over to house the car, or provide sterile patio space; factors that increase urban temperatures and increase flooding risk.\u201dThe study recommends that rewards for sustainable gardening could include reductions to council taxes, water bills or assistance with resources. Cameron suggested offering these payments or discounts to house owners with more than 50% of their garden space planted.The report also suggests that banning environmentally damaging materials such as pesticides, or practices such as installing astroturf, could also benefit the environment.Traditionally private garden management has been up to the homeowner, but Cameron says a more radical approach is needed to tackle the climate emergency and biodiversity loss at a city level.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Southern Queensland is earmarked for five zones, with four in central Queensland and three in the north of the state.About 22GW of new solar and wind projects will need to be connected by 2035 within the zones to meet its renewable targets, the government says.The state currently has 16GW of electricity generation, including 8GW of coal and 3.6GW of utility-scale solar and wind.By the end of the year, the Queensland government wants legislation put in place to allow the energy minister to designate the renewable energy zones.

        "text": "Labour has U-turned on its pledge to create a Scottish-style right to roam in the English countryside if elected, the Guardian can reveal.Instead of an assumed right of access, the party now says it will find other ways to create more access to land in England, after opposition from some landowners\u2019 groups.Campaigners reacted with dismay at the news. There has been a recent groundswell of public campaigns involving mass trespasses, which have sometimes attracted thousands of people, asking for a general right to walk across the English countryside. There is currently a right to roam over just 8% of England.Wales, like England, is under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act (Crow) meaning there is a right to walk on open country (mountain, moor, heath and downland) and \u201cregistered common land\u201d. There are no general rights to wander over the countryside in Northern Ireland.The previous shadow environment team, led by Jim McMahon, the MP for Oldham West and Royton, had committed to a Scottish-style right to roam, where there would be an assumed right for English people to walk around the countryside.The former shadow nature minister Alex Sobel, the MP for Leeds North West, told parliament earlier this year: \u201cLabour\u2019s approach, like in Scotland, will be that Labour\u2019s right to roam will offer access to high-quality green and blue space in the rest of Britain. We will replace the default of exclusion with a default of access.\u201cResearch shows that people with a stronger connection to nature were more likely to behave positively towards the environment. It\u2019s quite simple: the more people engage with nature, the more likely they are to protect it.\u201dThis idea was criticised by rural campaign groups including the National Farmers\u2019 Union. Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, hinted that rural voters would not vote Labour if they implemented a right to roam policy, referring to it as an \u201cattack on the countryside\u201d.Labour sources told the Guardian this approach had now changed, and that instead they were working with rural groups to find ways to increase access without giving a widespread right to roam, where access is assumed across the whole country. The shadow ministerial team is considering reforming Crow instead. The 2000 act gives a legal right of public access to mountains, moorland, heaths and some downland and commons, alongside the more recently created England coast path.Toby Perkins, who since September has been the shadow nature and rural affairs minister, said: \u201cWe absolutely want to see access extended. Do we need to tread very carefully on this? Absolutely. We want to increase access to nature but we also need to look at it in terms of farmers and working collectively with them rather than a top-down approach.\u201dThe shadow environment secretary, Steve Reed, said that he would be \u201castonished\u201d if increased access to nature would not be in the next Labour manifesto but added there was a need to \u201crespect the needs of farmers, producers and growers not to have their crops damaged\u201d. He added that Labour would be producing a white paper on access to nature.Campaigners have criticised the change in direction. Guy Shrubsole from the Right to Roam campaign said: \u201cPiecemeal extension of the Crow Act won\u2019t lead to equitable access for the people who need it most. It\u2019s also an expensive and time-consuming approach. It took five years and millions of pounds to map access land when Crow was brought in, and resulted in a right to roam over just 8% of England, much of it very remote from where most people live \u2013 and it managed to create lots of access \u2018islands\u2019 that you can only reach by trespassing.\u201cScotland\u2019s default right to access land and water responsibly, with sensible exceptions and backed by a well-promoted outdoor access code, offers a much better, cheaper and more workable model that England should be following. It\u2019s also a vote-winner: polling shows 62% of the public support a Scottish-style right to roam for England.\u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with Labour as they develop their plans, and we\u2019ll be stepping up our campaigning over the next year to show why England should follow Scotland\u2019s lead on access.\u201dA Labour party spokesperson said: \u201cLet me be clear that under Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership, Labour has never committed to a Scottish-style right to roam. We want people from every background to have responsible access to nature around them, with access to parks and wildlife and the opportunity to enjoy our great British countryside.\u201d",

Many members, including Youngs, have threatened to stop sourcing from the fisheries if sustainable management is not achieved.This year, the Marine Conservation Society downgraded the sustainability rating of north-east Atlantic mackerel in its Good Fish Guide because of overexploitation. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) withdrew its blue-tick assurance of sustainability in 2019 for the same reason.\u201cThis is a collective failure by the coastal states,\u201d said Neil Auchterlonie, project lead for Napa, a coalition of 50 retailers and suppliers set up in 2019 after MSC certification was lost. \u201cThere is a real frustration around the fact that there is no movement on this.\u201dAt a meeting of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission this week, Napa called for urgent agreement or a binding dispute resolution mechanism to be put in place.Conservations say that 44% more mackerel is being caught than is sustainable. Photograph: Roy Waller/AlamyWhile the countries agree in principle to the total catch limits set by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the scientific body that advises governments, their lack of agreement on quota allocation has meant states have set quotas unilaterally and these limits are exceeded.Last month, Napa wrote an open letter to government ministers in the UK, EU, Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Russia, urging them to \u201cstop overfishing\u201d and come to a \u201csustainable and unanimous\u201d agreement on mackerel, herring and blue whiting quotas for 2024.But, after consultations between all the states with the exception of Russia, they released a statement regretting they \u201chad not yet been able to come to an agreement, despite having made some good progress\u201d and would reconvene by early 2024.Charles Clover, author and co-founder of the Blue Marine Foundation, said: \u201cThis is an overfishing disaster of potentially epic proportions and they are all looking the other way.\u201d He said it reflected badly on all nations, including the UK, which could \u201clead by example and declare a lower quota\u201d.\u201cInstead, the UK has negotiated some irresponsibly set quota off Norway and given it to some of the richest people in the fishing business, while the rest of the industry is in decline. Huge fortunes are being made out of fishing the stock irresponsibly.\u201dErin Priddle, regional director for the Marine Stewardship Council in north Europe, said: \u201cYou can\u2019t keep fishing above what the science says and expect things to be OK. Fish stocks are susceptible to crashes, as we\u2019ve seen with the collapse of the cod stocks off the Grand Banks in the 90s, or the collapse of herring in the 60s.\u201dAtlantic overfishing was already a problem.

The seeds are so dangerous to wildlife that just one can kill a bird, the groups note.Why does the US allow a controversial weedkiller banned across the world?Read more\u201cThey are highly toxic to pollinators, insects, birds, aquatic organisms that build the base of our food chain,\u201d said Amy von Saun, an attorney with the Center for Food Safety (CFS), a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit. \u201cBecause the seeds represent so much neonicotinoid use, this is where all the devastation is coming from.\u201dThe CFS is a co-plaintiff in the suit with Pesticide Action Network North America. Neonicotinoids are a controversial class of chemicals used in insecticides widely spread on cropland to treat for pests, but which a growing body of science has found harms pollinators and other insects not targeted by the chemical.Neonicotinoids work by destroying an insect\u2019s nerve synapse, causing uncontrollable shaking, paralysis and death.While neonicotinoids can be sprayed on cropland, about 95% of it is distributed via seeds. The chemicals are water soluble and easily leach into soils and streams, and clouds of neonicotinoid-laced dust released during seed plantings have caused mass bee die-offs, the groups say.Neonicotinoids from three major producers affect about 75% of all endangered species, the EPA recently found, and the UN reported cropland is now about 50 times more toxic than just a quarter of a century ago, contributing to an \u201cinsect apocalypse\u201d. The chemicals are so destructive that the European Union banned their outdoor use while Canada has also imposed restrictions.Among the issues at the center of the lawsuit is the seeds\u2019 minimal and unenforceable labeling. The suit asks a judge to compel the agency to require stronger and enforceable labeling.The suit also challenges the EPA\u2019s exemption of the seeds from registration as pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (Fifra). Registration would trigger closer scrutiny of their environmental and health impacts, and force the EPA to weigh the seeds\u2019 benefits against their costs. The agency would have to show the seeds do not cause unreasonable or adverse effects to the environment, as is the standard under Fifra.EPA science has found neonicotinoids harm endangered species while providing little benefit in terms of crop yield.\u201cIf you actually balance the benefit against the harms, it would not pass the Fifra test,\u201d von Saun said.However, the EPA has claimed it has already thoroughly studied neonicotinoids and does not need to conduct reviews of the seed. The CFS in 2017 petitioned the Trump EPA to re-examine its exemption for the seeds and ban them. The EPA ignored the petition until CFS sued in 2021 to force a response, and months later the Biden EPA denied the petition. The new case challenges that denial as unlawful.\u201cBecause coated seeds have significant adverse effects on the environment, EPA cannot continue to avoid its duty to review, balance the costs and benefits, and mitigate harm by unilaterally exempting coated seeds from FIFRA,\u201d the suit states.",

This was approved in June 2022, allowing it to hire a terrestrial ranger to capture the vervet monkeys.In December, the territory\u2019s ministry of tourism, economic affairs, transportation and telecommunication approved 100,000NAf ($55,000) funding per year for the project.Cull invasive mammals to save island species, experts urgeRead more\u201cThe foundation proposed two management options when requesting funding for these activities, one of which was a sterilisation programme and one which was a population management programme,\u201d Hickerson said.\u201cThe funding received to execute the project was the minimum requested in order to start managing the population.\u201dEusebio Richardson, a ranger with the foundation, said the government funding is \u201cessential\u201d for the project\u2019s success and has been used to purchase materials, equipment and training.\u201cWe were able to learn from an established trapper in St Kitts the most effective management practices,\u201d Richardson said.\u201cThis is key to ensure that within the time allowed we can make an impact and protect the biodiversity of the island.\u201dHickerson said that because of how quickly they reproduce it \u201cwould be best\u201d to capture or relocate the entire island\u2019s monkey population.The foundation plans to meet with the relevant agencies from French St Martin this week to discuss their part in the project.The R\u00e9serve Naturelle Nationale de Saint-Martin said in 2021 that the introduction of non-native animals such as vervet monkeys was eroding its natural heritage.",

I have a background in the oil and gas world, I knew that there were a few volcanoes, and the [increased] temperature is going to the coast.\u201dThe Netherlands\u2019 history as a major gas extractor means it has huge amounts of subsurface data. \u201cWe found out that there is a layer of porous stone, it\u2019s nice and warm, about 90C, so wouldn\u2019t it be an idea to use geothermal energy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to take it in our own hands and work with the local government. Just like food, we need energy to be reliable, affordable and it should not be commercialised. And that\u2019s the whole idea.\u201dUsing a geothermal \u201cdoublet\u201d technique, water can be pumped up from the ground in a production well and the heat extracted in a heat exchanger before the water is reinjected via an injection well.The public energy company Energie Beheer Nederland believes 25% of Dutch heat demand could eventually be met by geothermal energy. There are 26 working non-volcanic geothermal energy projects, mostly heating greenhouses between The Hague and Rotterdam, and a national mapping project and plans to more than double geothermal production by 2030.Phil Vardon, a professor of energy geomechanics at Delft University of Technology, is leading the science programme for a 2.5km-deep geothermal project being drilled in Delft to heat the university campus plus the equivalent of 10,000 houses.\u201cThe volcano is a bit of a gimmick, but what it does seem to have done is to increase the temperature locally,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can see this on temperature maps interpolated from drilling projects. One thing that isn\u2019t so good is the ability for the water to flow \u2013 there\u2019s a relatively limited thickness reservoir.\u201dStill, Energiewerkplaats Frysl\u00e2n, a network of professionals supporting local energy initiatives, has published an \u201cexploratory investigation\u201d into the potential of 500-metre or 3km-deep structures plus a district heating system, with a total estimated cost of between \u20ac143m and \u20ac188m. Johannes Lankester, the project leader, is positive, even if the local area would have to raise 30% of the total. \u201cTechnically, it is certainly very achievable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe heat is there but we want ownership as a community. In Frisian, we call this MienskipsEnergie [community energy].\u201dThe local council of South-west Friesland wants to set up this public heating network and develop more alternative energy sources and is appealing for government and European help. \u201cIn around 2027 we hope to drill for geothermal heat for Bolsward,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cGeothermal is a good additional source in the desired energy mix.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The letter cites \u201cseveral issues\u201d raised by the panel in a recent report that \u201cwarrant additional evaluation and review\u2019\u2019.The review, which will last at least two years, will \u201censure that air quality standards reflect the latest science in order to best protect people from pollution,\u201d, Regan said.Regan\u2019s decision avoids an election-year battle with industry groups and Republicans who have complained about what they consider overly intrusive EPA rules on power plants, refineries, automobiles and other polluters.The delay marks the second time in 12 years that a Democratic administration has put off a new ozone standard before an election year. Barack Obama shut down plans to tighten ozone standards in 2011, leading to a four-year delay before the standards were updated in 2015.Paul Billings, senior vice-president of the American Lung Association, called the EPA\u2019s decision \u201cprofoundly disappointing\u201d and a missed opportunity to protect public health and promote environmental justice. A recent report by the lung association showed that minority communities bear a disproportionate burden from ground-level ozone, which occurs when air pollution from cars, power plants and other sources mixes with sunlight. The problem is particularly acute in urban areas.Billings called the ozone rule \u201cthe public health cornerstone of the Clean Air Act,\u201d, adding that \u201cmillions of people will breathe dirty air for many more years\u201d as a result of the delay. An increased number of asthma attacks, sick days and even premature death are likely to occur, he and other public health advocates said.Raul Garcia, vice-president of policy and legislation for Earthjustice, called the delay \u201cshameful\u201d and unjustified. \u201cThe science tells us we are long overdue,\u201d Garcia said.Democratic lawmakers also were disappointed. \u201cInaction threatens public health and puts those with underlying conditions such as asthma or lung disease at an elevated risk,\u2019\u2019 said the Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse. He and 51 other Democrats had urged swift action on a new rule.\u201cUnfortunately we\u2019ve seen the process for updating the ozone standards repeatedly swept up in political games that risk lives,\u2019\u2019 the lawmakers said in a 7 August letter to the EPA.Conor Bernstein, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, applauded the EPA\u2019s decision \u201cnot to race ahead with an unnecessary revision of the ozone standards\u201d, which have not been changed since 2015. The current standard was reaffirmed in December 2020 under Donald Trump, a Republican.The American Petroleum Institute, the top lobbying group for the oil and gas industry, said current ozone limits were among the most stringent in the world. \u201cAny tightening of the standard could impact energy costs, threaten US energy security and impact businesses and American consumers,\u201d a spokeswoman, Andrea Woods, said in an email.The EPA\u2019s decision comes after two advisory panels \u2013 the EPA\u2019s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee and the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council \u2013 urged the agency to lower the current ozone standard of 70 parts per billion (ppb).\u201cBased on the scientific evidence currently available, it is concluded that the level of the current standard is not protective with an adequate margin of safety,\u2019\u2019 the EPA panel said in a June report. A limit of 55 to 60ppb \u201cis more likely to be protective and to provide an adequate margin of safety\u201d, the panel said.Tomas Carbonell, a top official in the EPA\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation, said the report by the scientific panel left the EPA with little choice but to launch a comprehensive review even though all but one panel member supported a stricter ozone standard.\u201cWhen we\u2019re looking at our national air quality standards, there\u2019s really no way to cut corners around that process,\u2019\u2019 Carbonell said in an interview.The agency will convene workshops next spring to gather information and will release a review plan for action in late 2024, he said.

The cost of removing the soft plastic is estimated to be $3.5m.The NSW EPA has asked supermarkets to either dispose of the waste in landfill, reprocess it, or export it internationally. Landfill is the only viable option as other nations are unwilling to accept contaminated soft plastic and that volume of plastic cannot be reprocessed domestically.Of the 15 locations, 11 are of such a concern that the EPA has notified Fire and Rescue NSW and has requested the operators take immediate action to mitigate risk.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe EPA chief executive, Tony Chappel, said thousands of customers had diligently collected soft plastic and dropped them at local supermarkets because \u201cthey trusted their waste would be diverted from landfill and recycled\u201d.\u201cThe extent of soft plastic waste sitting in warehouses across NSW is very concerning and I know customers will be disappointed,\u201d Chappel said.\u201cThese stockpiles are stored from the floor to the ceiling, blocking entryways and preventing adequate ventilation with the soft plastic estimated to fill about three-and-a-half Olympic-sized swimming pools.\u201dColes and Woolworths have six days to respond to the EPA\u2019s clean-up orders.A Woolworths spokesperson said the company was surprised to receive the notice as REDcycle had indicated they had plans to deal with the stockpiles.A Coles spokesperson said the company was disappointed by the notice and was determined to find \u201ca short-term solution\u201d to allow recycling to return.Chappel said it was unfortunate the plastic would now be redirected to landfill but \u201cregulatory action had to be taken to protect NSW communities\u201d.\u201cOur largest retailers have an important role to play in how we continue to reduce plastic waste and we are committed to working together so we can support opportunities and minimise risk,\u201d Chappel said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mining of rare earths, in particular, can generate large volumes of toxic material and processing is complex, giving China a large head start over other other nations.While Australia has large deposits of most minerals, it traditionally sends them offshore for processing.Last month the resources minister, Madeleine King, told a Darwin audience that included key allies and trading partners that China\u2019s position in the market posed a strategic challenge to Australia.\u201cWorking together, like-minded partners can build new, diverse, resilient and sustainable supply chains as part of a global hedge against concentration,\u201d she said.The government position represents a green light to the mining sector to pursue projects that produce minerals that go into low-emissions technologies such as electric vehicles, batteries and solar panels, as well as defence applications.There are also government grants available for companies developing mineral processing and manufacturing capabilities.Jubilee questions whether Australia can mine itself out of a climate crisis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was here that sailor Alexander Selkirk was marooned from 1704 to 1709, an experience that was fictionalised by Daniel Defoe in Robinson Crusoe after whom the archipelago\u2019s main island is now named.In the early 18th century, the shores of Robinson Crusoe island teemed with Juan Fern\u00e1ndez seals. However, the animals were hunted for their fur and meat with such vigour that around 4 million are now thought to have been slaughtered. By the 19th century, the species had disappeared and was believed to be extinct until, in the 1960s, a small colony was found in a cave on the island.Since then, the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez seal, which has become a protected species, has slowly recovered and has a population of around 80,000 living on the island\u2019s rocky shores, according to the most recent figures. Adults forage at sea while pups are born in November and December with soft black fur that fades to light brown in a few years.Little else was known about the seal\u2019s detailed biology until scientists began studying the Arctocephalus philippii in detail recently \u2013 making some startling discoveries in the process. \u201cWe collected samples of their faeces and found they contained extremely high levels of cadmium and other elements such as mercury,\u201d said Constanza Toro-Valdivieso of Cambridge University\u2019s conservation research institute.\u201cThe discovery was very surprising,\u201d she said. \u201cCadmium is poisonous to mammals but somehow these seals were processing it and passing it through their digestive systems and seem to be suffering little harm in the process.\u201dApart from the seals\u2019 unexpected ability to tolerate high levels of cadmium, there was also a puzzle about its source. \u201cThe soil on the island is low in cadmium and so is the water around it,\u201d said Toro-Valdivieso. \u201cSo where was the cadmium coming from, we wanted to know?\u201dThe answer appears to be that it probably came from food the seals ate, scientists concluded. \u201cSome species of seal, like the Antarctic fur seal, have a diet rich in krill which they catch locally. However, Juan Fern\u00e1ndez seals eat lots of squid and fish, and females are known to travel up to 500km to catch their prey.\u201dJuan Fern\u00e1ndez fur seals, which can swim very long distances to find prey. Photograph: Constanza Toro-ValdiviesoIn doing so, the seals would have to travel through the South Pacific gyre, a huge, rotating ocean current in which all sorts of debris gets trapped. \u201cIt is here they are most likely to come in contact with cadmium,\u201d said Toro-Valdivieso, who has been studying the species for several years. The debris swept into the gyre includes man-made polymers containing cadmium, it is speculated, and this is being picked up by fish and squid and then ingested by the seals. \u201cThat is the most likely the source of the cadmium,\u201d said Toro-Valdivieso whose team has just published a paper on their research in Royal Society Open Science.However, identifying the source does not explain how the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez fur seal manages to shield itself from ingesting a substance so poisonous to other mammals. High levels were found not only in its faeces but in the bones of seals that had died of natural causes. The researchers also found high levels of silicon in their bones, which may be offsetting the impact of cadmium, they suggest.\u201cThe discovery that these animals appear to tolerate high levels of cadmium in their bodies has important medical implications, and it is very important for us to find out exactly how the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez seal achieves this,\u201d said Toro-Valdivieso. \u201cIt could be something to do with the animal\u2019s genes or something else completely. It is an issue that we are hoping to follow up over the coming years. These animals have a lot to tell us.\u201d",

The town considered \u201chome\u201d was Roccaraso, a ski resort where he scoffed a batch of freshly baked biscuits after breaking into a bakery in late 2021.Carrito was also spotted drinking from a fountain in the village, and would often stay overnight, sleeping among pine trees before going in search of food, rummaging through bins and dining off leftover pizza and sandwiches.The biscuit heist led to the bear being captured and banished to a remote area in the mountains, but he later returned, leading to a second capture in March last year and a period in an enclosure. That attempt to rewild him also failed, and Carrito returned to Roccaraso, where he was seen earlier this month on a ski slope.One explanation for Carrito\u2019s sociability was his upbringing: he was one of four cubs born to a bear called Amarena. Such was the rarity of the event \u2013 on average, female Marsicans give birth to between one and three cubs \u2013 that the family attracted much attention. One of the first villages in which Amarena and her cubs appeared was Carrito, hence the nickname.The Marsican is a critically endangered subspecies of the brown bear living in the Apennine mountains that straddle the Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise regions.Their numbers across the area have dwindled to about 50 over the past two decades, thought to be the result of illegal hunting or the animals being hit by vehicles.\u201cWe are all very shocked,\u201d Mena Ricci, a regional representative for the World Wildlife Fund, told La Presse news agency. \u201cUnfortunately, this was a death that none of us wanted to hear.\u201dLuciano D\u2019Alfsono, a deputy with the Democratic party, said the death of Carrito was sad news \u201cfor all of us in Abruzzo\u201d, adding that Carrito would be remembered for his \u201cirreverent and free nature\u201d.People also took to social media to express their sadness. \u201cJuan was one of us,\u201d wrote a commenter on Twitter.",

I looked into his cruel, merry eyes and I waited for him to stop.\u201dI was staying at a small hotel on the island of Agistri with my family (early coins, made on the Aegina, the larger island next door, bore the image of a tortoise). One morning, a manager at the hotel called my small daughter over to see something: it was a tortoise. The tortoise was named Platonus, she said: Plato, but a woman. Most people thought that the tortoise was male, but she liked to think it was female. She would only be out here for a few more weeks, and then she would crawl under the small shed that served as an office, burrow herself into the cool earth and stay there for the rest of summer. This is called Aestivation, rather than hibernation \u2013 many tortoises hibernate instead, in winter. (You can also hibernate a tortoise in a fridge).When it was cool enough to come out, Platonus would emerge, heroically, and \u201cmake urine\u201d for a very long time, the manager said. Then she would be given as much lettuce as she wanted. What did lady Plato think about while she was in there? You could imagine her, holding forth while expelling a small yet significant stream, telling you what she had realised, that, \u201cThe measure of a woman is what she does with her power\u201d, or that \u201cNo one is more hated than she who speaks the truth\u201d or, \u201cIt is time we put a stop to Americans referring to tortoises as turtles once and for all.\u201d You could imagine her as lady Saul Bellow, \u201can omniscient tortoise\u201d, as described by lady Martin Amis. I have been thinking about Platonus ever since, but especially last week, worrying about her and whether it will still be cool enough in her burrow and hoping she has had enough to drink.\nHelen Sullivan is a Guardian journalist.

        "text": "The UK risks being left behind Europe on cycling growth, experts have warned, as cycle sales are down by a quarter on pre-pandemic levels and electric bike sales are plateauing following a boom in 2020.Although cycling levels have significantly risen since the pandemic \u2013 up 33% in the year to 30 July, according to Department for Transport (DfT) figures \u2013 sales of new bikes are not keeping pace.Those in the industry say more needs to be done to boost cycling uptake, including investing in infrastructure, secure cycle parking, and e-bike subsidies and charging networks.According to the latest market report from the Bicycle Association, cycle sales are down more than a quarter on pre-Covid levels from January to June. Sales of hybrid and children\u2019s cycles, considered the two most \u201cmainstream\u201d categories, are worst affected, while \u201centhusiast\u201d categories of road and gravel bikes have grown. Cycle sales are generally linked with cycling levels.\u201cThings are very difficult right now,\u201d said Steve Garidis, the Bicycle Association\u2019s executive director. \u201cSince May 2021 sales have been tracking at below pre-Covid levels, and if you take out the 2020 mega boom in cycling and sales, we\u2019re now doing worse than we were before Covid hit.\u201cWhen I look at the comparison between the UK and what\u2019s happening in Europe it\u2019s just a bit depressing, it\u2019s sort of stark. There\u2019s a definite sense that we\u2019re being left behind, in terms of the size and value of the cycling market, but also left behind in terms of how people are getting around, both for leisure and for everyday [cycling trips].The association says the cost of living crisis is colliding with a dip in demand for bicycles, while prices have increased and the pound is weakening against the dollar.The charity Cycling UK believes part of the growth in cycling, which it says accelerated in March, is due to rising fuel prices, encouraging more people to switch to bikes for some trips, but warns that growth could be undone if fuel prices fall, unless cycling infrastructure improves.Garidis added: \u201cEven e-bike growth, which had been pretty stratospheric and was driving the whole market, has stalled and is flat. Clearly e-bikes have got a massive application in bringing people to cycling \u2026 and we\u2019re missing out.\u201dE-cycles are the most natural \u201ccar replacement\u201d and make up 9% of bike purchases in the UK. However, in Europe e-bikes make up 23% of sales. The British and German markets are similar in size but only 165,000 e-bikes are sold a year in the UK compared with 2 million in Germany.The government has set a target for half of all short trips to be walked or cycled by 2030 in England. In 2019 more than 60% of trips between one and two miles were driven. Research shows most people want to cycle more and support cycling investment but fear of motor traffic is the number one barrier.In May, Cycling UK was selected to run a national e-cycle support programme, to include short- and long-term e-bike loans and trials. However, the scheme appears to have stalled and neither Cycling UK nor the Department for Transport were able to discuss its status or when it would restart.About 190,000 electric cars were registered in the UK in 2021, just 15,000 more than e-cycles, but there are more than 30,000 e-car charging points and only 16 e-cycle charging points.Sign up to First Edition, our free daily newsletter \u2013 every weekday morning at 7amGaridis said: \u201cI think that if you had partnerships, collaborations with national chains of coffee shops or hotels or other sorts of practical everyday destinations, where there might be mutual benefit in attracting new customers coming on two wheels instead of four, people [may] take notice and think \u2018I could do that\u2019.\u201dHowever, he added, there are other pressing issues. \u201cThere\u2019s just a massive lack of infrastructure in terms of parking at the moment. Obviously, there\u2019s a big focus [on] cycle lanes, which is brilliant, but you need somewhere to lock the bike when you get to the other end.\u201dGaridis urged the government to introduce subsidies for e-bikes: \u201cIt\u2019s been the big difference between what the UK has done to promote uptake versus what Europe has done, and you can see the results.\u201dA DfT spokesperson said: \u201cE-cycles are a vital part of our ambitious action to increase active travel, and we are investing in a wide range of measures to support more people to use them and reduce emissions. This includes committing \u00a342m to improve cycle storage at railway stations and cycle routes to stations, \u00a38m for a national e-cycle pilot to boost take-up, and putting tax benefits in place for buying e-cycles through the Cycle to Work scheme.\u201d",

Last year, the company paid out \u00a3878,000 in bonuses to directors.She said: \u201cI understand the strength of feeling about the issues linked to river health which is why I\u2019ve decided that this year I won\u2019t be accepting a bonus.\u201cThis is the right thing to do and I\u2019m committed to improving Yorkshire Water\u2019s performance.\u201dSarah Bentley, who runs Thames Water and last year received a \u00a3496,000 payout, forwent her payout alongside the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Alastair Cochran, who will also skip his bonus for 2022-23.

We\u2019re listening to our customers, we get it,\u201d said Davy, whose company spilled untreated sewage 37,649 times last year. She runs Pennon Group, the listed owner of South West Water, and has turned down a pay rise for the past two years.The exact size of the bonuses that would have been due to the three executives has not been disclosed.An analysis of water companies\u2019 annual reports released last month found the bonus pool for executives stood at an average of more than \u00a3600,000 at each company. In total, the 22 water bosses paid themselves \u00a324.8m, including \u00a314.7m in bonuses, benefits and incentives, in 2021-22.Emma Clancy, the chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, welcomed the decisions. She said: \u201cOur recent research, Bridging the Gap, shows that bonuses add to people\u2019s current frustration with the water industry and they would like much more openness and transparency on this issue. This announcement shows that people\u2019s concerns are being listened to.\u201dGary Carter, a national officer at the GMB union, said it was \u201cgrotesque for water companies to post such mammoth profits while so many are repeatedly caught dumping sewage in our nation\u2019s glorious seas and waterways\u201d.He added: \u201cGMB calls on all water bosses to waive their annual bonuses until Ofwat can confidently say the scourge of sewage dumping is under control.\u201dThe Financial Times reported on Monday that Britain\u2019s privatised water and sewage companies paid \u00a31.4bn in dividends in 2022, an increase from \u00a3540m the previous year.Last week, Macquarie, the Australian owner of Southern Water, the utility company criticised for discharging sewage into the sea, posted record profits after a boom in its commodities trading division.",

In 2021, Legal & General Investment Management, one of the oldest fund managers in the City of London, backed a similar resolution put forward by Follow This at Shell\u2019s AGM. The resolution was backed by 30% of Shell\u2019s shareholders.Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, said BP\u2019s existing plans to reduce emissions do not go far enough because they rely on reducing the carbon intensity of the energy BP sells while absolute emissions are expected to keep rising until the end of the decade.The Paris agreement calls for all countries to limit their emissions in order to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1.5C above pre-industrialised levels by 2050. The 2020s are considered crucial years to cut carbon in order to remain on track.Van Baal has written to BP\u2019s shareholders urging them to vote in favour of their resolution, saying it was \u201cthe only way to compel BP to reduce emissions this decade\u201d.BP\u2019s board has urged shareholders to vote against the resolution, saying it is \u201cunclear\u201d, \u201csimplistic\u201d and \u201cdisruptive\u201d. The company added that it would threaten BP\u2019s \u201clong-term value creation\u201d.In a separate climate revolt the three pension funds are expected to vote against the re-election of BP\u2019s chairman, Helge Lund, in protest at BP\u2019s decision to water down its green pledges earlier this year without shareholder consent. The local government pensions schemes LGPS Central and Brunel Pension Partnership are planning to join the funds in voting against Lund\u2019s re-election.BP\u2019s chief executive, Bernard Looney, originally set out a \u201cnet zero carbon\u201d plan that included a goal to cut the company\u2019s oil and gas production by 40% compared with 2019 by the end of the decade. However, he reset the target to 25% by 2030 in February after reporting the highest profits of BP\u2019s 114-year history thanks to soaring oil and gas prices.Diandra Soobiah, Nest\u2019s head of responsible investment, said the fund wants BP to invest more in low-carbon energy and renewables instead of new oil and gas sites.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Researchers at the University of Vienna have discovered particles of plastic in mice\u2019s brains just two hours after the mice ingested drinking water containing plastic.Once in the brain, \u201cPlastic particles could increase the risk of inflammation, neurological disorders or even neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s,\u201d Lukas Kenner, one of the researchers, said in a statement, although more research is needed to determine the relationship between plastics and these brain disorders. In addition to potentially severe degenerative consequences, the researchers also believe that microplastic contamination in our brains can cause short-term health effects such as cognitive impairment, neurotoxicity and altered neurotransmitter levels, which can contribute to behavioral changes.In the course of their research, the team gave mice water laced with particles of polystyrene \u2013 a type of plastic that\u2019s common in food packaging such as yoghurt cups and Styrofoam takeout containers.Using computer models to track the dispersion of the plastics, researchers found that nanoplastic particles \u2013 which are under 0.001 millimeters and invisible to the naked eye \u2013 were able to travel into the mice\u2019s brains via a previously unknown biological \u201ctransport mechanism\u201d. Essentially, these tiny plastics are absorbed into cholesterol molecules on the brain membrane surface. Thus stowed away in their little lipid packages, they cross the blood-brain barrier \u2013 a wall of blood vessels and tissue that functions to protect the brain from toxins and other harmful substances.While the Vienna study focused on the effects of plastics consumed in drinking water, that\u2019s not the only way humans ingest plastic. A 2022 Chinese study concentrated on how nasally inhaled plastics affect the brain, with researchers reporting \u201can obvious neurotoxicity of the nanoplastics could be observed\u201d. In basic terms, the inhaled plastics lead to reduced functioning of certain brain enzymes that also malfunction in the brains of patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s.Of course, we eat plastic, too, and new research on plastics and brain health is emerging alongside breaking studies on how the contaminants affect our gastrointestinal health. Much like the blood-brain barrier, the gastrointestinal barrier is also vulnerable to interference by nanoplastics \u2013 which can cause inflammatory and immune reactions in the gut, as well as cell death.At this point, it\u2019s clear that plastics have infiltrated most parts of the human body, including our blood, organs, placentas, breast milk and gastrointestinal systems. While we don\u2019t yet fully understand how plastics affect different parts of our bodies, many chemicals found in various types of plastic are known carcinogens and hormone-disruptors, linked to negative health outcomes including obesity, diabetes, reproductive disorders and neurological impairments in foetuses and children.This spring, the Boston College Global Observatory on Planetary Health led the first-ever analysis of the health hazards of plastics across their life cycle and found that \u201cCurrent patterns of plastic production, use, and disposal are not sustainable and are responsible for significant harms to human health \u2026 as well as for deep societal injustices.\u201dNone of this is encouraging news \u2013 especially in light of the fact that plastic production is still accelerating. Yet, improving our understanding of plastic\u2019s implications for human health is a crucial step towards banning plastic \u2013 a move 75% of people globally support. Encouragingly, more than 100 countries have a full or partial ban on single-use plastic bags, and policymakers in some countries are thinking about plastics more in terms of their costly externalities, including pollution and effects on health. Yet global plastics regulation is still vastly out of step with both scientific and public opinion.In 2021, the Canadian government formally classified plastics as toxic under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. The move means that the government has more control over the manufacture and use of plastics, limiting the kinds of exposure that threaten health. In response, plastic producers including Imperial Oil, Dow Chemical and Nova Chemicals formed a coalition to try to crush these regulations.More countries must designate plastics as toxic and increase its regulation, doubling down on the message that when plastic affects our health \u2013 even going so far as to alter our brain function \u2013 it infringes on our human rights.\nAdrienne Matei is a freelance journalist\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The defense department has only looked at about one-third of more than 700 facilities suspected of having contaminated the ground with PFAS.Drinking water of millions of Americans contaminated with \u2018forever chemicals\u2019Read moreWhile the report acknowledges the pollution, it does not clarify which drinking water sources are polluted, how high PFAS levels are in the polluted water systems, or provide information about the plumes\u2019 locations.The sheer number of bases and the lack of clarity is \u201cshocking\u201d, said Scott Faber, the vice-president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group non-profit, which tracks military PFAS pollution.\u201cA good neighbor would let you know that their use of PFAS was the reason your water was contaminated, and a bad neighbor would only tell you: \u2018Hey, a plume is heading in your direction,\u2019\u201d Faber said.The defense department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems.They are dubbed \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because most do not degrade in the environment.The military is considered one of the largest PFAS polluters in the world, largely due to its use of firefighting foam laced with the chemicals discharged during emergencies or training exercises. Some of the highest levels of PFAS in groundwater ever detected have been found around bases. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s advisory health guidelines state that less than one part per trillion (ppt) in drinking water is safe, while levels found around military bases have exceeded 2.25m ppt.Congress in recent years has included in Defense Authorization Acts requirements for the military to begin investigating PFAS pollution in and around its facilities. The defense department has so far confirmed PFAS contamination at 455 bases, it wrote in the new report, and of that group it has confirmed that 275 out of 295 checked, or about 90%, have plumes \u201cin the proximity\u201d of drinking water supplies.The report does not clarify what \u201cin the proximity\u201d means and does not specify which types of drinking water supplies are threatened. Though it provides a list of bases, public drinking water systems can draw from surface water or community wells, and it is unclear how the plumes may be impacting those pulling water from private wells.\u201cThat is what we know so far because that\u2019s all the DoD told us, and it took an act of Congress to get that much information,\u201d Faber said.Though the report does not provide clarity on which communities are drinking contaminated water, the defense department in August issued a separate report revealing that it is now providing clean drinking water to 53 communities.The military currently only provides clean drinking water for communities with levels of PFOA and PFOS, two kinds of PFAS compounds, above 70 ppt.

The consumer rights group, which represents national groups across Europe, also said green imagery on bottles gave the \u201cfalse idea\u201d of environmental neutrality.There is no guarantee that a plastic water bottle will be recycled, said Ursula Pachl, deputy director general of BEUC. \u201cThis greenwashing must stop.\u201dDrink bottles are among the most common forms of plastic polluting European beaches. In a year, the average European drinks around 118 litres of bottled water, according to the BEUC, 97% of which is thought to come in bottles made from plastic.But the amount that gets made into new bottles depends only partly on factors that the company or the customer can control. Other factors include the systems used to collect, sort and recycle the bottles, as well as technical limits and rules around what materials can be used to package food and drink.The BEUC has lodged a complaint with the European Commission over the phrase \u201c100% recyclable\u201d because a consumer cannot assume their water bottle will be recycled. Across the EU, about half of PET bottles are recycled, according to estimates from Zero Waste Europe.The BEUC has also targeted the phrase \u201c100% recycled\u201d because bottle lids in the EU cannot be made of recycled materials. It also said that labels are rarely made from recycled material.Last week, a report from campaign groups ClientEarth, ECOS and Zero Waste Europe found rates of plastic bottle recycling were improving, but that a fully circular system does not exist. \u201cThe idea of used bottles simply becoming new bottles over and over again may be appealing to companies and consumers alike, but it does not reflect the outcome for PET-based bottles in Europe,\u201d the authors wrote.The EU has cracked down on greenwashing as corporate sustainability claims have grown. In September, the European parliament and council agreed on new advertising rules banning generic sustainability claims like \u201cclimate neutral\u201d, \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201ceco\u201d unless backed up by proof of excellent environmental performance.There is a lot of concern about plastic pollution and a lot of confusion about recycling, said Rosa Pritchard, a lawyer with ClientEarth, which supported the BEUC challenge. \u201cConsumers are just tired of greenwashing, generally, and really want information they can count on.\u201dThe BEUC has the power to issue external alerts \u2013 formal complaints about suspicious business practices \u2013 to the commission and the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network. The commission cannot fine traders who are found to have breached advertising rules but national authorities from EU member states may choose to do so.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

If global heating rises to 2C above pre-industrial levels, similar heatwaves will be expected every five or six years. The world has now heated by about 1.2C.Lincoln Muniz Alves, a researcher at the Brazil National Institute for Space Research, said the main message was that human rather than natural factors were behind the extremes. \u201cWe want to be clear: a developing El Ni\u00f1o would have contributed some heat, but without climate change, spring heat this intense would have been extremely unlikely,\u201d he said.Millions of people have been affected as Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay have sweltered in spring temperatures where national maximums have risen above 40C. The impact is still being measured. Four heat-related deaths were reported in S\u00e3o Paulo, which registered 37C, according to the scientists, though they say the true toll will probably not be known for several months.This followed a warm winter in many parts of South America. In Argentina, the weather bureau described the situation as \u201coff-the-scale\u201d after the hottest start to August in 117 years.Outside the area of the study, meteorologists have expressed horror at the brutal extremes that have continued until today in some places.To the west in the high Andes mountains of Chile, monitoring stations measured heat of 37C in August, melting the snow below 3,000 metres (9,840ft), which has a knock-on effect for downstream valley residents who depend on meltwater during the summer.To the north, many areas of the Amazon rainforest are suffering a harder dry season than usual. At least 139 endangered river dolphins have died at Lake Tef\u00e9, which resembles a hot bath after a protracted drought dried up most of the water. The human signal in this case is less clear.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The problem is not the grass itself, but the mowing, fertilisation and irrigation required.The researchers reviewed 65 studies of emissions and sequestration of carbon by turf or lawn compared with trees. They concluded that, globally, the equivalent of 157 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per hectare could be avoided, and up to 1,630m tonnes of carbon absorbed from the atmosphere over 20 years if a third of mown grass in cities were planted with trees.Turf wars: the artists who want to mow down the menace of lawnsRead moreThe traditional lawn \u2013 a uniform, trimmed carpet of ryegrass \u2013 has been under fire for years because of its lack of biodiversity and voracious appetite for fertiliser, herbicides and mowing.As climate breakdown drives more extreme weather, droughts have highlighted the irrigation demands of velvety turf. In response, anti-lawn and \u201crewilding\u201d movements have seeded across the UK, with advocates pushing to replace the lawn with trees, shrubs or a more diverse mixture of unmown wildflowers and native grasses. In 2021, 30 UK councils adopted \u201cNo mow May\u201d to encourage wildflower growth and natural pollinators.The research\u2019s lead author, Prof Len Gillman, said that while abandoning the mower and letting a lawn go wild \u201cmight cut down on the emissions due to maintenance, it\u2019s not going far enough\u201d.\u201cIn terms of climate change we need to absorb as much carbon as we possibly can from the atmosphere \u2026.

        "text": "Thames Water is on the brink of collapse, with emergency plans being drawn up to take the company into temporary public ownership. It\u2019s an extraordinary state of affairs: how could a business with a regional monopoly over an essential service not manage to maintain a financially sustainable footing? The answer: an extractive ownership model has seen the company loaded with debt, and returns for its investors prioritised over the needs of both people and the environment. As interest rates have risen sharply over recent months, this inherently precarious business model has come under acute and seemingly fatal pressure.The story of Thames Water is emblematic of wider failures of privatisation. Since the late 1980s, water companies in England and Wales have paid out \u00a372bn to shareholders. To help pay for this generosity, the water companies \u2013 which were sold off without debts \u2013 have borrowed on an exceptional scale, accumulating a debt pile of \u00a353bn.What has this meant for customers? In real terms, bills have increased by around 40% since privatisation, yet investment by the companies has gone down by 15%. The consequences are glaringly evident: up to 2.4bn litres of water a day (equivalent to nearly 1000 Olympic swimming pools) are leaked by English water companies. Every day, raw sewage is discharged into our rivers and seas more than 1000 times on average, for a total of over 9m hours since 2016. With this scale of neglect, it\u2019s hardly shocking that just 14% of English rivers have adequate ecological status.Who, then, benefits from this model, if neither people nor planet? International investors, for one. Indeed, over 70% of English water companies\u2019 value is foreign owned. Thames Water, specifically, counts among its top investors a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi investment authority, the China Investment Corporation, and two Canadian public sector funds. The Universities Superannuation Scheme, too, has a sizeable stake, in a paradoxical relationship that sees a vital service many beneficiaries of that scheme may use, faltering under the strain of demand for high returns for a pensions system equally under pressure. Neither can we forget the perks for water executives: the outgoing CEO of United Utilities, the UK\u2019s most polluting water company, made an impressive \u00a31.4m this year by selling his shares before his retirement.It\u2019s a self-defeating arrangement in which England and Wales are global outliers: indeed, they are globally exceptional in having wholly privatised water systems. There is a simple reason for this. Internationally, water is seen as a less attractive prospect for private investors relative to other infrastructure sectors, not least because the essential nature of the service means that operators cannot cut off provision in the event of non-payment. To compensate, government policy has actively made the sector a more attractive investment proposition through an accommodating regulatory regime and by, for example, making it relatively easier to increase tariffs.Thankfully, there is a wealth of alternative models from which we can draw inspiration. Across Europe, the norm is for water infrastructure and services to be in public hands, owned and successfully operated for the public interest. Nor do we have to look as far as the continent: we have a readymade comparison in Scotland, which effectively resisted the privatisation of Scottish Water. The contrast between the two is stark: users in the rest of the UK spent an estimated 10% more on water bills than those in Scotland, and the publicly owned company invested 35% more per household per year than private firms in England.What lessons can we draw from this story? That water privatisation has been an unvarnished success in only one way: the enrichment of its overseas shareholders and executives. With Thames Water possibly following on the heels of Bulb\u2019s emergency nationalisation, we should expect the failure of highly indebted, privatised utilities to accelerate. And perhaps above all, the simple lesson that almost every country in the world has learned: that for something as fundamental and so ill-suited to competition as water, public ownership for the public benefit is the only acceptable approach.\nMathew Lawrence is director of Common Wealth and co-author of Owning the Future with Adrienne Buller\n",

As did scores of others, I lost a colleague and friend when Will Steffen left us on Sunday after a battle with pancreatic cancer.It is impossible to overstate Will\u2019s impact on science. The many tributes to his work can only scratch the surface of his legacy. He led the effort to map the Great Acceleration of human impact on the physical and biological systems of our planet, culminating in consideration of the geological age of humans \u2013 the Anthropocene, first proposed by Nobel prize winner Paul Crutzen.Will Steffen, \u2018courageous\u2019 climate scientist, dies in Canberra aged 75Read moreWith colleagues, Will catalogued Earth\u2019s tipping elements and their alarming trend of moving to transgress boundary conditions beyond which human ability to slow climate change would be ineffectual. He built the scientific case for Planetary Boundaries with Johan Rockstr\u00f6m. For decades Will led vast international research teams, trained students, mentored colleagues, advised governments and courts, communicated clearly to civil society, wrote innumerable reports and connected with those at the coal face of climate change. He dared to ask the question: \u201cWhere on Earth are we going?\u201dI am filled with grief at losing Will at a time when we need his calm, direct voice more than ever. It is natural that I\u2019m angry and fearful, emotions born of grief. But my emotions stem not only from the grief of losing Will but also from grief over what we have already lost to insufficient action on climate change, and what we stand to lose if we continue on the path of tepid and ineffectual posturing, greenwashing and half measures.I\u2019m angry about the same things that made Will angry. And fearful of the same things that made him apprehensive.These are Will\u2019s words in 2020 when asked what he felt when thinking about climate change:\nAs the climate system continues to spiral towards a potentially uncontrollable state, I am struck with an increasing sense of both anger and apprehension. I\u2019m angry because the lack of effective action on climate change, despite the wealth not of only scientific information but also of solutions to reduce emissions, has now created a climate emergency. The students are right. Their future is now being threatened by the greed of the wealthy fossil fuel elite, the lies of the Murdoch press, and the weakness of our political leaders. These people have no right to destroy my daughter\u2019s future and that of her generation.I\u2019m apprehensive because the more we learn about climate change, the riskier it looks. Even at a 1 degree C rise in global temperature, extreme weather events are becoming more violent and dangerous than models have predicted. Over the last 5 years, our knowledge of tipping points in the Earth System has advanced rapidly, with many already showing signs of instability. Worse yet, they can interact like a row of dominoes to set off a tipping cascade, driving the Earth to hotter and more unstable conditions. That is my worst fear \u2013 that we may reach a \u2018point of no return\u2019 where we commit our children to a future of hell on Earth.\nYou would have been unlikely to directly experience Will\u2019s anger and fears about climate change and environmental destruction because he transformed those emotions into constructive research, communication and, most of all, personal and collective action.Let part of his enormous legacy be that we do the same, with the same clarity of purpose, determination and humanity that Will displayed. Let that be how we honour and offer our gratitude to my dear friend Will Steffen, an incomparable champion for planet Earth and all that is nurtured by it.

In a paper published in the journal Science, US and Australian researchers say that historical data on sea surface temperatures, over four decades, suggests that this year\u2019s extreme marine heatwaves may be a precursor to a mass bleaching and coral mortality event across the Indo-Pacific in 2024-25.Mass coral bleaching happens when delicate corals become stressed due to factors including heat, causing them to lose their brown microbial algae, turning them white. At low stress levels, the algae can return to corals over a few months. But many Caribbean reef areas have recently experienced historically high sea temperatures that began one or two months earlier and lasted longer than usual.Crucially, 2023 is the first year of a potential pair of El Ni\u00f1o years, with the warmest average global surface sea temperature from February to July on record. Since 1997, every instance of these El Ni\u00f1o pairs has led to a global mass coral bleaching event.Hoegh-Guldberg, whose work has helped to shape the world\u2019s understanding of the risks to the ocean\u2019s richest ecosystems, said: \u201cThe probability is that somewhere in the next 12 to 24 months, we are going see El Ni\u00f1o combine with warming sea temperatures and have a really big impact.\u201cWe are literally in uncharted territory, which we know very little about and don\u2019t know how to respond to and I think we\u2019re dangerously exposed.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know the implications of such a spike in temperature,\u201d said the scientist, speaking from Dubai, where he is attending the Cop28 climate summit. \u201cWe may see storms that are even larger than the ones we\u2019ve been seeing.

We were not prepared. Our officials were not prepared, for a raging inferno of 1,000-degree heat that moved at lightning speed, reducing our historical town of Lahaina \u2013 once the capital of the Hawaiian kingdom \u2013 and 2,000 homes to ash.

We need somewhere to place the blame. Herman Andaya, head of the Maui Emergency Management Agency, has publicly stated that emergency sirens were intentionally not activated because they are used for tsunami warnings. He feared that people, hearing the sirens, would run the wrong way, into the oncoming fires. This decision is not only the apotheosis of stupidity. It feels criminal. He has already resigned.

Nor will other Pacific peoples. Across our Oceanic continent, rainfall is decreasing drastically. Island droughts are becoming extreme as global temperatures continue to rise. Strong winds will create more catastrophic fires, as we have already witnessed in Papua New Guinea, parts of Australia and New Zealand, and in smaller landmasses in French Polynesia and Samoa.I want to talk about greed \u2013 about global nuclear weapons testing, chemical corporations, oil drilling, big pharma. But I fear it\u2019s too late. I have little hope that our planet can recover. Parts of Europe are in flames. Towns in Norway are flooding from torrential rains.

Many citizens have already left the town voluntarily.The plan to shut off the town came after the Libyan Red Crescent raised its estimate of the number of dead and missing. The UN has launched an appeal for $71m and said 884,000 people had been affected by the floods that hit north-east Libya early on Sunday morning.\u201cBodies are littering the streets, washing back on shore and are buried under collapsed buildings and debris.

Though local authorities and communities can be under immense pressure to bury the dead quickly, the consequences of mismanagement of the dead include long-lasting mental distress for family members as well as social and legal problems\u201d.Pierre Guyomarch, the head of the ICRC\u2019s forensics unit, said: \u201cThe belief that dead bodies will cause epidemics is not supported by evidence. We see too many cases where media reports and even some medical professionals get this issue wrong. Those who survive an event like a natural disaster are more likely to spread disease than dead bodies.\u201dThe exception was where bodies were in or near fresh water supplies, underlining the need for fresh water. Libyan health authorities have reported more than 40 cases of water poisoning.A UN report showed that more than 1,000 people had so far been buried in that manner since the country was hit by floods.The part closure of the town has done nothing to stave off the growing anger at the way politicians have handled the crisis, by issuing unclear evacuation orders before the floods and by failing to do anything to siphon water off the two dams, as had been done before.A multi-year failure to maintain the dam is being put down to negligence and a \u20ac100m compensation demand made by a Turkish firm that was originally contracted to maintain the Derna valley dams.Many Libyans were calling for any official inquiry into the causes of the disaster to have an international component to prevent a cover-up.Elham Saudi, the director of Lawyers for Justice in Libya, said: \u201cAn international inquiry is required to investigate and hold accountable those responsible, whether through negligence or corruption, for this tragedy. One thing we have learnt is that the political elite in Libya are incapable and unwilling to hold themselves to account.\u201cWe have seen this in action on several occasions in recent days including [speaker of the House of Representatives] Aguila Saleh telling Libyans \u2018don\u2019t say if we had done this or that \u2026 this is a natural disaster\u2019 in his first address to the nation since the floods. Impunity can longer be the norm in Libya and we certainly know from our research and the public outcry that we Libyans will no longer tolerate it.\u201dIn a sign of how militias still dominate in the town, a coordination meeting was held on Thursday in Derna between representatives of the Tariq bin Ziyad Brigade, 444th Brigade, 166th Battalion, and other brigades accused of trying to take control of aid distribution.Libyan TV stations have come together to start an appeal for the region and Friday prayers were devoted to those affected.",

They are known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down, and they have been linked to cancer, high cholesterol, liver and kidney disease, fetal complications and other serious health problems in humans.The chemicals are thought to be polluting drinking water for more than 200 million people, and the study is the second this year to suggest widespread contamination of freshwater US fish.The independent studies and research from state and federal regulators have shed light on a potential health threat in Michigan and nationally that public health advocates say needs urgent attention.The findings are \u201csad\u201d, said Erica Bloom, one of the study\u2019s co-authors with the Ecology Center, an environmental non-profit that tracks PFAS contamination in the state.\u201cIt just demonstrates how ubiquitous these chemicals are in the environment,\u201d she said.The levels found in fish sampled from those rivers ranged from about 11,000 parts per trillion (ppt) to 180,000 ppt, and tests revealed 14 different kinds of PFAS compounds.While no state or federal limits on the amount of PFAS in fish or other food exist, Michigan\u2019s health department issues \u201cdo not eat\u201d advisories for fish fillets with levels over 300,000 ppt of PFOS, just one kind of PFAS compound. Fillets typically have lower levels of PFAS than the organs, which were included in Ecology Center\u2019s testing.However, recent research showed how the nation\u2019s freshwater fish can represent a dangerous exposure route even at levels below the state\u2019s threshold. Eating a fish fillet with 11,800 ppt of PFOS is equivalent to drinking water contaminated with PFOS at 48 ppt every day for a month.The situation presents not just an environmental safety issue to those who fish in rivers as a hobby but an environmental justice issue as it is lower income residents who most frequently rely on eating fish they catch from freshwater rivers, as well as groups that fish as a cultural practice. The Ecology Center worked with about a dozen local anglers who caught the fish that were sampled.\u201cFishing in these rivers is an important way of life, and we\u2019re not out here to tell people to stop fishing \u2013 but if you\u2019re fishing, here are some things to look out for,\u201d Bloom said.She said it is up to state regulators to protect anglers, and the results highlight how agencies are failing to keep pace with new science and regulations around PFAS. Michigan\u2019s 300,000 ppt \u201cdo not eat\u201d level for PFOS was based off outdated science from the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).The EPA last year lowered its health advisory limit on PFOS in drinking water after it found virtually no exposure level is safe. Michigan has yet to adjust its fish advisory accordingly, and doing so would dramatically lower the \u201cdo not eat\u201d threshold.Bloom said it is unclear why state regulators have not updated their advisories, and added that fish consumption levels in Michigan \u201cshould be reviewed and lowered\u201d.\u201cFish advisories need to be as protective as possible to keep pace with what\u2019s happening with emerging science at the federal level,\u201d Bloom said.",

The most recent was in April at Bettws Hall Game Farm, a major facility near Newtown in Powys where protection zones are still in place.Game birds are held in captivity in the UK before they are released for the shooting season. The Animal and Plant Health Agency classifies the birds as poultry while in captivity, but once released they are classed as wild birds for avian flu rules, and their breeder or owner is no longer their legal keeper.About 55 million pheasants and red-legged partridges and 2.6 million mallards are reared in captivity each year for release into the countryside to be shot for sport. Bird releases start towards the end of June and continue through July and August, but before then they can be moved from farms to release pens which are often unroofed. This can lead to interactions with wild birds, putting them at risk, the RSPB says.The Welsh government\u2019s chief veterinary officer, Dr Richard Irvine, announced the latest protection zone around Bettws Hall Game Farm on 27 April. Under the declaration game birds are not allowed to be released.The chair of the National Farmers Union in Montgomeryshire, Richard Jones, said it must be enforced and that no birds should released from the farm this season.He said releases would put thousands of birds, including poultry, at risk. Jones, whose farm is within the six-mile (10km) protection zone around Bettws Hall, still has to keep his poultry, which is supposed to be free range, indoors.He is awaiting the arrival of 21,000 new birds at the beginning of June. \u201cThe release of pheasants and game birds will hugely increase the risk to my birds. Once they are released, they are wild birds and will mix with other wild birds with avian flu. It will become a humungous problem. Meanwhile we are not allowed to release our birds outdoors because we are in the restriction zone.\u201dThe RSPB says there should be a ban on bird releases to stop the catastrophic spread of avian flu.

In the decade since, 17 of his neighbours\u2019 homes have had to be demolished, or have been swept away into the waters of the North Sea. His is now just 5 metres from the fast-crumbling cliff, isolated and unreachable by car after part of the road collapsed into the North Sea.The people of Hemsby would seem to be natural beneficiaries of official policies to adapt to the climate crisis. Under the Climate Change Act 2008, the government is required to produce a national adaptation programme every five years, setting out plans protect communities in the UK from the extreme heat, flooding and coastal erosion expected as the climate breaks down.But critics, including the government\u2019s own advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), have said it is not doing enough. And now, in a case believed to be the first of its kind, Jordan is taking the government to court, alleging its failure to set out lawful \u201cadaptation objectives\u201d in its latest plan is a breach of his human rights.\u201cThe collapse of the road made so many more things a struggle,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cFrom emergency services to bin collections, grocery shopping and even the post, it\u2019s been one thing after another. It feels like we\u2019re being forgotten up here.\u201dIn a care home 200 miles away, in Wetherby, West Yorkshire, lives Doug Paulley, a co-claimant in the case. He lives with a number of long-term conditions that make him particularly susceptible to overheating, including autonomic dysfunction, which has contributed to several strokes, as well as diabetes and a heart condition.\u201cDuring last year\u2019s heatwaves in the UK, I practically had to hibernate to get through it, and couldn\u2019t venture outside,\u201d said Paulley. According to the Health Security Agency 2,803 excess deaths occurred during the summer of 2022. Those with medical conditions, older people and very young children were especially at risk.But the adaptation plan fails to set out a cross-sector approach to addressing heat-related risks to the social care sector, nor does it provide dedicated long-term funding to retrofit care homes with insulation and cooling measures.\u201cEven when temperatures are in the minuses, I\u2019m most comfortable wearing just a T-shirt and trousers \u2013 that should give an idea of how much I struggle with heat intolerance,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the world only getting hotter, it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult for someone with my complex health needs to cope.\u201dThe latest national adaptation programme (NAP3) was published in July, four months after the CCC warned MPs in a report to parliament that its predecessor plan, NAP2, included credible plans for only five of the 45 adaptation areas.Jordan and Paulley\u2019s legal challenge, supported by Friends of the Earth, argues that NAP3 continues to fall short. They say it breaches the Climate Change Act by failing to set out lawful \u201cadaptation objectives\u201d, and by failing to consider and publish an assessment of the risks to delivery of the plans and policies included.In a case that is believed to be the first to challenge UK climate adaptation plans, they also ask the court to rule that the deficiencies in the national plan breach Jordan and Paulley\u2019s human rights by failing to protect their lives, homes and property from foreseeable impacts of the climate crisis.Friends of the Earth also believes that the Department for Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) failed to lawfully assess the unequal impacts of the NAP3 on protected groups under the Equality Act 2010, in line with the \u201cpublic sector equality duty\u201d.The claimants have already written to the environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, to raise their concerns. But her department denied any wrongdoing and refused to disclose key documents. On 17 October, the claimants filed their case at the high court.Will Rundle, the head of legal at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThis year has set a string of new global temperature records which have driven deadly heatwaves and wildfires across the world, and last July the UK exceeded 40C for the first time ever.\u201cWe need our government to take urgent action to curb emissions and put in place credible plans to keep us safe from the extreme weather and impacts of climate change already devastating people\u2019s lives. But the government\u2019s latest adaptation plan continues to fall far short of what\u2019s needed \u2013 and comes amid backtracking on the green policies needed to tackle climate change.\u201cOur co-claimants are among those most at risk from the climate crisis. We hope this case will lead to more ambitious and effective adaptation plans that better protect everyone, especially those who are already being hardest hit by climate breakdown.\u201dThe Guardian has contacted Defra for comment.",

Spilled cargo from the derailment included petroleum used to make asphalt.Emergency response personnel and hazmat experts were at the crash scene, in a rural area of Richland county, on Monday morning. There was no fire and the spill occurred in a cold and snowy area, minimizing the threat to public safety, according to the rail company.Officials will allow the spilled materials to freeze in order to aid the cleanup, which is expected to take seven to 10 days.The derailment in East Palestine earlier this year sparked an outcry over what critics call insufficient safety regulation of the transportation of hazardous materials. Sensors on the track \u2013 whose parameters were set by the private rail company, Norfolk Southern \u2013 failed to alert conductors in time that a car bearing had become wildly overheated, according to initial findings by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).The Norfolk Southern train derailed 38 cars, including 11 known to contain toxic materials, causing explosions, a fire and a massive plume of smoke. The spilled cargo included vinyl chloride, a flammable chemical known to cause liver cancer. Rail officials, concerned at the prospect of the vinyl chloride exploding, chose to burn off the chemical in a controlled fire.Residents in the immediate vicinity of the East Palestine derailment were ordered to evacuate in case of an explosion, but most were told to shelter in place. Officials from the rail company and from the US Environmental Protection Agency have said that the area is now safe, but some independent scientists and outside activists have expressed grave concerns.Writing in the Guardian, Stephen Lester, a toxicologist at the nonprofit Center for Health, Environment & Justice, argued that the decision to burn off the vinyl chloride \u201cunleashed a gigantic cloud full of particulates that enveloped surrounding neighborhoods and farms in Ohio and Pennsylvania\u201d.Burning vinyl chloride generates dangerous compounds called dioxins, Lester said, which are associated with the military herbicide Agent Orange and with Love Canal, New York, the site of one of the most notorious chemical disasters in the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It is evidence they are \u201cunfit to have a role in the energy transition\u201d, said Collin Rees, the US program manager at Oil Change International.Oil majors have over the past several years announced seemingly ambitious climate plans. BP promised to cut its fossil fuel investments by 35 to 40%. Shell pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Exxon, meanwhile, said it would slash its emissions and gas burning and touted its investments in algae as a potential carbon-free fuel. Chevron announced an \u201caspiration\u201d to reach net-zero upstream emissions by 2050. And dozens of oil companies signed onto an initiative to cut their methane emissions.But in 2023, firms took actions that stood in sharp contrast to those plans.\u201cCompanies have gotten more brazen about their plans to keep polluting,\u201d said Rees. \u201cThey took the mask off.\u201dIn October, ExxonMobil agreed to buy the shale group Pioneer Natural Resources, and Chevron announced plans to acquire the Texas oil company Hess \u2013 two of the country\u2019s largest oil and gas deals in decades.Both mergers are being investigated by federal regulators for potentially impeding competition. And both amounted to Exxon and Chevron placing vast bets on a continued future for fossil fuel production in the US, despite scientific consensus that coal, oil and gas must be phased out to avert the worst consequences of the climate crisis.Fossil fuel companies reneged on their previous climate promises earlier in the year, too. BP scaled back its emissions-slashing goal from 35% by the decade\u2019s end to a 20 to 30% cut, while ExxonMobil quietly walked back funding in algae-based biofuels and Shell announced that it would not increase its investments in renewable energy in 2023.A major reason for the change in tack was a shifting market, experts say. As fossil fuels were becoming less profitable years ago, companies announced plans to diversify their business models. But gas prices surged after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and fossil fuel companies saw record profits.The US as a whole extracted more oil and gas than ever before in 2023. And globally, fossil fuel companies invested twice as much in oil and gas as they should, if they wanted to avert catastrophic levels of heating, the global energy watchdog International Energy Agency found last month.\u201cThey have left no doubt that their pledges were deployed for cynical political purposes, only to be ditched when they no longer suited the industry\u2019s strategic position,\u201d Dan Cohn, global energy transition researcher at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told the Guardian in July.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is Britain\u2019s road belt and it\u2019s time to build on it.\u201dEarly stage design projects to test the approach are under way in Rochdale, Bedford and Southend-on-Sea.The idea comes as motoring and housing rise up the political agenda. Amid signs of a culture war, Rishi Sunak has told motorists he is \u201con their side\u201d and launched a review of low-traffic neighbourhoods. He unsuccessfully tried to overrule Sadiq Khan\u2019s extension of London\u2019s \u00a312.50 a day ultra low emissions zone. Both initiatives have become lightning rods for wider political debates about personal freedom, inequality and, in some cases, conspiracy theories about shadowy forces attempting to control the population.Meanwhile, the government is 125,000 below its target to build 300,000 homes a year by the middle of this decade, based on official figures for England for the year to April, and its latest planning policy requires \u201csuitable brownfield sites and underutilised land\u201d to be used before the green belt.Create Streets was founded by Nicholas Boys Smith, who leads the government\u2019s new \u201cbuilding beautifully\u201d agency, the Office for Place. It has influenced the Conservatives\u2019 latest planning policies and counts one of King Charles\u2019s leading urbanism advisers, Ben Bolgar, among its collaborators.Its proposal states: \u201cWe could create proud boulevards lined with beautiful homes on space currently given over to needlessly, counterproductively wide roads.\u201dThe road junction at St Mary\u2019s Gate, Rochdale, where Create Streets is proposing to remove a turning lane.Boys Smith said: \u201cIt is no secret that the most productive and prosperous cities, including London \u2026 don\u2019t exclusively rely on cars to get around,. It is time not to widen our road belt but to build upon it.\u201dSteve Gooding, the director of the pro-motoring thinktank the RAC Foundation, said narrowing roads would require planners to decide which traffic they no longer wanted.\u201cGrand visions need to be backed up by meticulous planning and adequate funding if they are to be turned into a livable reality where our shops are well-stocked, our kids can get to school, and our home deliveries arrive when we expect them,\u201d he said.He conceded that increasing the number of 20mph zones meant sweeping junctions and large roundabouts designed decades ago for higher speeds could be revisited, but \u201cit remains to be seen whether linking that with housing development unlocks the scale of investment that\u2019s currently beyond the reach of our cash-strapped local councils\u201d.David Milner, the deputy director of Create Streets, who wrote the policy paper, said: \u201cWorking together, there is no reason these redundant spaces can\u2019t be turned into beautiful streets and beautiful homes.\u201dA scheme involving Rochdale council is exploring removing a turning lane from a four-lane urban highway at St Mary\u2019s Gate in the north of the town, allowing designers to create a corner block, and adding 400 homes.Milner said Birmingham was one place that had partly \u201cbroken its concrete collar\u201d, where the fast inner ring road was removed in the late 1980s. In Bedford, a plan has been mooted for 105 homes by redesigning the wide Greyfriars roundabout.",

The train in The Hague keeps rolling. We\u2019re going to stop it.\u201dWith almost 90% of votes counted, the BBB had secured a share of 19% \u2013 enough, according to projections, to give it 15 members in the 75-seat senate when the provincial assembly members choose the new upper house in late May. That would make the new party the biggest bloc in the upper chamber with the combined Labour (PvdA) and GreenLeft parties, also projected to have 15 senators. Rutte\u2019s coalition is on course to see its combined seat total fall to 24 from 32.Rutte, prime minister since 2010, congratulated Van der Plas but said on Thursday the outcome did not threaten the government. \u201cI think the cabinet can remain stable over the coming years, because we have parties that want to take responsibility,\u201d he said.At the very least, however, the result looks likely to severely complicate the remainder of his premiership. In principle, the rightwing liberal leader could turn to the PvdA/GreenLeft alliance for the senate majority needed to pass new legislation. In practice, both parties have said they will block the coalition\u2019s entire climate programme unless it goes further and faster, for example by closing all coal-fired power stations within two years and halting subsidies for fossil fuel-based industry.Rutte\u2019s task is likely to be even more difficult in the 12 provincial assemblies, which are charged with putting government environment plans into action: the BBB finished first in five of them, on some occasions with scores of more than 30%.The government aims to buy farmers out and reduce livestock numbers by up to a third to help halve nitrogen emissions by 2030. Soil and water nitrogen levels exceed EU limits in the Netherlands, the world\u2019s second-biggest agricultural exporter.The same problem has also halted construction projects despite a major housing crisis, with environmental groups winning court cases ordering the government to limit emissions and preserve nature before new building permits can be granted.The BBB, which has won the support of far-right and populist parties internationally, claims the problem has been exaggerated and that farmers\u2019 livelihoods are being sacrificed to the green transition.The election also showed how fickle the fortunes of populist parties can be. The vote share of the far-right Forum for Democracy (FvD), led by Thierry Baudet, which won nearly 15% of the vote in 2019 provincial elections, plunged to 3%.",

        "text": "Bird populations in the UK continue to crash, new data shows, as campaigners predict the government will fail to meet its own nature targets unless radical changes are made.Statistics released by the government show that bird populations continue to decline in the long and short term. In 2021, on average the abundance of 130 breeding species was 12% below its 1970 value. Though much of this loss was between the late 1970s and the late 1980s, caused mostly by relatively steep declines in woodland and farmland birds, there was still a significant 5% decrease between 2015 and 2020.Between 2015 and 2020, 24% of species increased, 28% showed little change and 48% declined. Woodland birds continue to fare the worst, with a 12% decline between 2015 and 2020.Wildlife experts agree that the decline in bird populations is largely driven by habitat loss.The government passed the Environment Act into law in 2021, which requires a halt in species decline by 2030. Campaigners have said that radical changes to government policy are needed if it is to meet its own legally binding targets.Richard Benwell, the CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: \u201cAs political parties turn their sights to the general election, they would do well to heed the warning written into today\u2019s wild bird statistics. The decline of nature has continued, relentless and unabated, for decades.\u201cMeeting the legally binding target to stop wildlife losses by the end of the next parliament can\u2019t be achieved with a legal tweak here, some spare change there. Serious, sustained investment, proper penalties for pollution, and action in every sphere of government must be the hallmarks of any nature-positive manifesto.\u201dBritain ranks bottom in Europe for nature connectednessRead moreDr Richard Gregory, the RSPB\u2019s head of science, said: \u201cEveryone should be concerned that UK bird populations are continuing to decline as this is a crucial indicator of the condition of our environment and health of our natural world. We cannot keep publishing report after report charting the decline of the UK\u2019s wildlife without UK governments delivering on their commitments to take urgent action to restore nature and halt wildlife decline.\u201cWe are in a nature and climate emergency, and we need urgent action to keep common species common and save those already on the brink of being lost. This is not something on the distant horizon, but on our doorsteps.\u201cThe UK is among the most nature-depleted countries in the world, bottom of the table compared to the rest of the G7, but we can change this if we begin to seriously address the drivers of wildlife decline in the UK.\u201dThe government admits that the state of the bird population is a good indicator for how other species are faring, which means that if they are in decline, there is a good chance other wildlife are too.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \u201cBird populations have long been considered to provide a good indication of the broad state of wildlife in the UK. This is because they occupy a wide range of habitats and respond to environmental pressures that also operate on other groups of wildlife.\u201cIn addition, there are considerable long-term data on trends in bird populations, allowing for comparison between trends in the short term and long term. Because they are a well-studied taxonomic group, drivers of change for birds are better understood than for other species groups, which enable better interpretation of any observed changes.\u201dA Defra spokesperson said: \u201cUnder the Environmental Improvement Plan, we set out clear steps to halt the decline in species abundance by 2030 and improve the status of wild birds and other species which play an important role in our ecosystems. We are already taking robust action to reduce key pressures on wild birds and improve their habitats. For example, our targeted species recovery efforts have helped to improve the conservation status of 96 priority species, including the curlew and bittern.\u201d",

        "text": "Scaling Rishi Sunak\u2019s empty home to drape it in black fabric in protest at oil drilling is not the first time Greenpeace has targeted the home of senior politicians.The environmental group surrounded David Cameron\u2019s Cotswolds cottage in 2014 to campaign against his support for fracking, and mounted the roof of John Prescott\u2019s home in 2005 in a demonstration against the government\u2019s slowness on climate targets. It has also previously carried out stunts at Sunak\u2019s North Yorkshire mansion.But this time, No 10 was in no mood to turn a blind eye. The government ordered an immediate ceasing of ties with the group, which engages with departments on a range of policy issues.Sunak government will go down in history as failing UK on climate, Greenpeace saysRead moreClambering on to a politician\u2019s home was always going to be a controversial move. Some countries, such as Ireland, are taking steps to ban protests outside politicians\u2019 houses, and MPs have a right to be concerned about their security after the murders of Jo Cox and David Amess.But anyone with a cursory glance at Greenpeace\u2019s history would know the organisation\u2019s commitment to non-violent peacefulness during its direct action protests.Its policy experts are regularly consulted by Whitehall officials and they are regarded as an integral part of the non-governmental organisation ecosystem campaigning for global progress on the climate emergency.However, casting Greenpeace activists as extremists appears to suit the Conservative\u2019s aims of trying to paint Labour as being allied to \u201cwoke\u201d organisations.A culture war campaign is under way to associate Keir Starmer with \u201clefty lawyers\u201d who support asylum seekers in their efforts to come to the UK, as well as \u201ca criminal eco mob\u201d of Just Stop Oil protesters because one of the group\u2019s donors has also given money to the Labour party.The refusal to deal with Greenpeace is part of this drive. Shortly after cutting ties with the organisation, Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, called on Starmer to ban members of Greenpeace from standing for parliament after it emerged a Labour candidate for Mid-Bedfordshire had taken part in a zombie-themed protest outside the Home Office against the public order bill.\u201cLabour have gone too far this time \u2013 plotting to put eco-fanatics in parliament,\u201d he said.The government has claimed to stand up for free speech and against \u201ccancel culture\u201d, appointing a Cambridge philosophy professor as a \u201cfree speech tsar\u201d for universities in opposition to the no-platforming of people because of their views.However, Sunak\u2019s administration appears far less tolerant of free speech for people with different goals to its own \u2013 or when it suits them to create a clear dividing line with Labour.The prime minister\u2019s government believes the voting public \u2013 however keen they are in opinion polls to show they support climate policies \u2013 are suspicious of activists who disrupt daily life, being concerned about anti-motorist policies and less favourable towards net zero when it starts affecting their cost of living.Politics has held a fragile consensus on the need to tackle the climate crisis for some time, but Labour is acutely conscious of the Conservatives\u2019 attempts to make the speed and spend on achieving net zero into an electoral issue.Anticipating more Conservative attacks, Starmer last Sunday distanced the party from the \u201ccontemptible\u201d disruption of groups such as Just Stop Oil and called on Sunak to stop \u201ctrying to create a cultural wedge between motorists and those who want to tackle climate change\u201d.The risk is that Sunak\u2019s move to present himself as \u201ceco-pragmatist\u201d against Starmer\u2019s \u201ceco-fanatic\u201d will lead both sides to water down the strength of their net zero policies at the very time the government\u2019s own experts are warning that more, not less, action is needed. This article was amended on 11 August 2023 to clarify reference in the sub-heading to Greenpeace as a \u2018charity\u2019. For legal reasons, the organisation\u2019s campaigning arm is a limited company.",

        "text": "Everyone who cares about public health and environmental regulation should welcome the expansion of London\u2019s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), which launches on Tuesday. Air pollution is estimated to cause 4,000 premature deaths each year in the capital, with nitrogen dioxide from exhausts being the main danger, along with particulate matter whose effect is likened by scientists to inhaling tiny particles of tar. Air pollution causes disproportionate harm to low-income families, who are most likely to live on main roads and least likely to own cars. It is particularly damaging to children\u2019s growing lungs. That the mayor, Sadiq Khan, has defied pressure to delay or weaken the scheme is to his credit.In France, vehicles that do not meet new limits have been banned from urban areas. In London, drivers of non-compliant vehicles \u2013 mostly petrol ones dating from before 2005, and diesel before 2015 \u2013 must pay a daily charge of \u00a312.50, with higher charges for lorries and coaches. While no scheme is flawless, the improvements to air quality achieved by the existing scheme, covering inner London, mean that Londoners can be confident of the extension\u2019s health benefits.There is no point, however, in denying the risks. Mr Khan\u2019s decision to press ahead was made easier because of Labour\u2019s large lead in London polls and with the Conservatives in disarray. However, opponents to Ulez expansion have been emboldened by the Tories\u2019 narrow victory in July\u2019s Uxbridge byelection, where the scheme was seen as a factor in the campaign. In Manchester, another Labour mayor, Andy Burnham, paused a planned clean air zone in the face of rising protests and cost of living pressures. His argument is a good one: the Treasury should fund a scrappage scheme, compensating businesses and owners of polluting vehicles, to ensure they do not bear a disproportionate cost.Under the terms of London\u2019s \u00a3110m scheme (funded by the mayor), owners of disqualified cars can apply for a \u00a32,000 payment, with differing terms for motorcycles and vans used by businesses. Earlier this month, eligibility was widened so that applicants no longer need to be on benefits. Mr Khan has done the right thing because central government did not. Such measures should also help calm his party leadership\u2019s nerves, post-Uxbridge, and win over some voters worried about rising bills. Nevertheless, police in London have warned of the risk of vandalism to fixed cameras.Air quality matters to voters but so do living standards, including transport costs, the personal freedom associated with driving, and fairness. The struggle to reconcile these priorities is why the significance of the Ulez scheme goes beyond London. Finding ways to protect the environment, while sharing out the cost of the transition away from fossil fuels, is the key public policy challenge of our time.It speaks volumes about Rishi Sunak that rather than come up with solutions he prefers to whip up resentment about the need to adopt greener lifestyles. Such grievances are not entirely without basis. Small business owners, or drivers of 10-year-old diesel cars, may feel legitimately angry about policies targeting them rather than multiple-car households or the growing number of private jets. Ministers have given financial assistance to Birmingham, Bristol and Portsmouth to help fund their clean air zones, but have refused to support London\u2019s scheme. Rather than capitulate in the face of Tory attempts to exploit the climate crisis for short-term political gain, Labour nationally should call them out.",

However, I don\u2019t agree that here in the UK the main obstacles are ignorance and disbelief. Despite the lack of sufficient media coverage, I think that a large proportion of the adult population is aware of what is happening and anxious about the future (though not necessarily following through on sufficient lifestyle changes). They are preoccupied with the demands of everyday life and not convinced or inspired to join collective action.The main campaigning organisations in which I am involved have so far failed to get across the message that we are all, as humanity, in the same precarious situation and must unite in demanding that our governments act with proportionate urgency. We must speak as one and act in ways that are inviting to others to act with us or alongside us.We need to convince politicians that we are in a global emergency and that they cannot carry on as if that were not so. Our current essentially two-party, adversarial system must be transformed, so that addressing the climate and ecological crisis becomes a cross-party agenda; and international policies of contest for dominance must give way to serious and urgent efforts for cooperation to meet the survival needs of humanity, and of the Earth as we know it. Diana Francis Bath The planet is indeed burning, as we hear and read about in terrifying detail every day. And some people are acting. Just Stop Oil are on the streets of London and have been every day for 13 weeks. Booed, shouted at, manhandled off the road and arrested. This is what happens to those who try to sound the alarm.

Anne TaylorOxford I take exception to the suggestion in Jonathan Freedland\u2019s article that the climate emergency is in some part the fault of climate scientists for not using stronger language. I remember the reaction when stronger language was used. Up went the cry of \u201cscaremongering\u201d. Climate scientists were told to moderate their language or they wouldn\u2019t be listened to.Climate scientists have behaved with integrity, knowledge, determination, persistence and self-sacrifice. They made sure that all governments were well acquainted with the facts. In doing so, they hoped they would be dealing with rational, responsible, resolute people. Who else would you go to? But they were wrong; governments were soon shown to be poorly educated \u2013 more swayed by belief than by evidence \u2013 and also supine.Climate scientists, not perfect of course, are nevertheless the only people to emerge with any credit at all from the climate catastrophe.

I quit flying three years ago. I\u2019m not afraid to fly; I stopped because of the climate crisis. In addition to travel, I write about green issues, and I decided I could no longer in good conscience specialise in sustainability while continuing to fly.I was a late convert to the cause, taking a plane to Israel in 2020 to write about a Palestinian cycle advocacy group. A trip like that would be off limits to me today, even if peace broke out any time soon. It\u2019s all but impossible to reach Israel from Europe without flying. It\u2019s almost as tough to reach the Antipodes from the UK without a long-haul flight, so bang goes a quick-ish trip to New Zealand or Australia.I could still get to North America if I waited for one of the monthly crossings on Cunard\u2019s Queen Mary 2 to New York from Southampton, but I couldn\u2019t get there in a rush: there and back would take two weeks (and tickets for paying travellers start at around \u00a31,000, one way).Quitting flying has undoubtedly shrunk my world. But I still do long-haul trips within Europe, using high-speed trains and slow-speed sleeper services. I also take to the water: I\u2019ve written up train-and-ferry trips to Malta, Sardinia and Ibiza. I also crossed the Dover Strait on a test sail for a proposed wind-powered catamaran ferry from Dover to Boulogne.And, somewhat surprisingly, my work hasn\u2019t suffered. Without flying, I\u2019ve still been able to file copy from the European Commission in Brussels, penned business stories from the Tour de France\u2019s visit to Denmark and swanned around Sweden on a press launch for a new electric car. When I reported on the opening ceremony of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in 2021, I cycled there from Newcastle. When I had to go back for the summit\u2019s closing, I took the Caledonian Sleeper train from London.But for all this eco street cred, I can\u2019t help but feel I am a lousy flight-free advocate because I\u2019m yet to convince my family to follow suit. Last year, my wife flew to Madeira without me (there are no ferries to the island), and at the time of writing this piece, our three millennial kids were on separate flight-based holidays in Belgium, Dubai and Greece.When I moan, ever so gently, about their chosen mode of (planet-trashing) travel, they point out I\u2019m a hypocrite because \u2013 and it\u2019s true \u2013 I have spent a lifetime flying. Piqued by my holier-than-thou snarks, they argue I am in no position to lecture them.

He also announced a delay to the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars, from 2030 to 2035, softened measures to phase out gas boilers, and is pressing ahead with plans to scrap rules on sewage from new housing.These delays are only the latest example of a number of low-carbon measures that have been held up or ditched over years of Conservative government, with the result that homeowners and taxpayers will have to pay tens of billions of pounds to bring newly built homes up to low-carbon standards.The delays have resulted in years of unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions, and higher energy bills for residents.There is some division on the subject within the construction and development sector; while some developers may welcome any delay to low-carbon measures, others are looking more to the future.The letter to Sunak, seen by the Guardian, notes that many construction and property companies were planning to make substantial investments in net zero, which are now in doubt. The 114 signatories include Arup, Laing O\u2019Rourke Construction, BNP Paribas Real Estate, Landsec, BAM, Buro Happold, Grosvenor, Avison Young, Great Portland Estates, Knight Frank, AECOM, Clarion Housing Group, and CBRE Group.\u201cOur industry has been working hard to gear up for that acceleration [of effort needed to meet net zero], but your announcement signalled less not more action needed,\u201d the letter says. \u201cIn order to bring forward big financial investments, to recruit and train hundreds of thousands of people and to bring the public along with us in this journey we need confidence in long-term active policy support from government. Your announcement has set that back.\u201dThe signatories also take issue with Sunak\u2019s insistence that his delays would save money for households. \u201cThe longer we delay and the more we see stop-start piecemeal policy-making, the harder and more expensive the task becomes,\u201d they say.The signatories urge Sunak to \u201cbring forward a comprehensive national strategy to retrofit our homes and buildings including much higher sustained government investment and market drivers to stimulate private investment as well as regulation. This would pay dividends to the treasury in tax returns.\u201dThey also call for a new \u201cfuture homes and building standard\u201d. This was supposed to be in consultation by now, but a government spokesperson told the Guardian the aim was now to publish a consultation by the end of this year.Simon McWhirter, the deputy chief executive at the UK Green Building Council, which organised the letter, said: \u201cIt\u2019s beyond disappointing and simply reckless to see this false narrative from government that delaying climate action would reduce costs to households.\u201cDecisions now \u2013 whether around retrofit or the quality of our new buildings \u2013 will dictate the quality and legacy of what we\u2019re able to achieve for generations. Delaying policies just means they\u2019ll have to be implemented much faster, later, pushing up the cost for everyone \u2013 householders and businesses alike.\u201dTor Burrows, the group sustainability director at the property company Grosvenor, said: \u201cDiluting the UK\u2019s commitment to net zero is not the way to build our economy, create jobs or address climate change. Businesses desperately need clarity and stability to help them plan how they will invest in green practices, tech and skills. Without this we risk losing out on crucial investment which will ease the cost of living and increase the country\u2019s global reputation and competitiveness.\u201dJonathan Gibson, the principal and global director for environmental, social and corporate governance at Avison Young estate agents, said: \u201cWhile we understand the challenges posed by the cost of living crisis and approaching elections, we must not compromise our long-term sustainability goals for short-term political gains. I urge the incoming government, especially in the context of the forthcoming general elections, to reconsider this regressive stance on net zero policies and demonstrate a genuine commitment to tackling climate change.\u201d",

Wages fell faster in real terms between 2008 and 2022 than in any other UK sector.Far more passengers are flying on holiday abroad than into the UK, with the NEF report finding a \u00a332bn \u201ctravel deficit\u201d in net spending between outbound and inbound tourism in 2019.Airports around the UK are seeking to expand, despite the recommendation of the Climate Change Committee that there should be no additional capacity to meet the country\u2019s 2050 net zero targets.Britain\u2019s biggest airport, Heathrow, has permission to build a third runway, although it says the plans are under review. Last week, Gatwick submitted an application to develop a second runway for full-time use. London City, Luton and Bristol are among other airports planning to expand, while terminal redevelopment at Manchester and Birmingham will also bring more passengers.Gatwick says its growth plans would \u201cinject \u00a31bn into the region\u2019s economy every year\u201d, while Bristol claims that extra flights will create up to 5,000 jobs in the region and provide a \u00a3430m economic boost. According to government-endorsed figures in the Airports Commission\u2019s report, Heathrow\u2019s runway would add \u00a361bn in growth over six decades.But the NEF report suggests that since the government\u2019s previous comprehensive assessment of the economics of air transport growth, \u201cstrong evidence, grounded in government data and academic research, suggests that the economic merit of expanding the UK\u2019s air transport sector has diminished considerably\u201d.It recommends that the government pause all airport expansion until it has conducted a review of the economic evidence and compatibility with policies on climate change and levelling up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Disagreements over how to refer to the war in Ukraine in the final text soured negotiations.The investment package, which includes private sector funding, covers projects to extract critical minerals, electrify bus fleets and help protect the Amazon rainforest in Brazil. It also includes projects in areas like healthcare and telecommunications.\u201cIt\u2019s not just about how much, but also how we are investing,\u201d said the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, adding that she wanted the money to come with high environmental and social standards.Diplomats at the summit made little progress on the controversial free trade deal with Mercosur, the South American trade bloc, which Von der Leyen said she hoped to conclude this year \u2013 beyond a line in the declaration taking note of \u201congoing work\u201d.The EU has not ratified the free trade agreement it agreed in 2019 with four Latin American countries \u2013 Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay \u2013 because it fears doing so will speed up the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Under former president Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil rolled back rules to protect the environment and starved its environment agency of funding to enforce laws. Farmers, loggers and miners cut and burned trees in the Amazon rainforest faster in 2021 than they had in the 15 years beforehand.Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who won Brazil\u2019s presidential election campaign on a platform of protecting the Amazon and Indigenous peoples\u2019 rights, has criticised the EU as \u201cprotectionist\u201d for attaching strings to the goods it imports.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, told reporters at the summit it was \u201cnot a threat but respect\u201d to apply the same standards at home and abroad. An unlikely alliance has formed in France between environmentalists, who fear the deal will destroy more of the Amazon, and farmers, who worry about competition from foreign imports.The EU hopes fostering trade with Latin America will help it hit its own climate goals. In a speech on Monday, Von der Leyen highlighted the region\u2019s potential for hydrogen \u2013 a gas that can be made with renewable energy to clean up industries like steel-making and shipping \u2013 and critical raw materials needed for the energy transition, like lithium.\u201cUnlike other foreign investors, we are not only interested in investing in the pure extraction of raw materials,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to partner with you to build local capacity for processing, for making batteries, and for the final products, like electric vehicles.\u201dIgnacio Arr\u00f3niz Velasco, a trade analyst at climate thinktank E3G, described it as a \u201csubtle but significant shift\u201d in EU rhetoric. During a trip to Latin America last month, Von der Leyen had talked about trade in hydrogen and minerals without adding support for the region\u2019s own industries.The Argentinian president, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, praised the agreement for moving away from \u201cextractivism\u201d. \u201cThis whole idea that Latin America is just a producer of raw materials has always prevented us from industrialising.\u201dThe summit, he added, was the first time this had changed. \u201cIt took us five centuries but we have succeeded.\u201dLatin America\u2019s biggest trading partner is the US, followed by China, which mostly buys raw materials and crops, and sells manufactured products.European politicians and businesses have tried to diversify their supply chains away from China in the wake of the war in Ukraine, which exposed the continent\u2019s over-reliance on imports of Russian gas. The move has given new importance to trade links with Latin America and the Caribbean.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to repeat some of the errors of the past,\u201d said Luisa Santos, the deputy head of lobby group BusinessEurope. \u201cWe want to make sure that we don\u2019t put all our eggs in one basket.\u201dThe summit declaration also stressed the importance of money to clean up economies, keep people safe on a hotter planet, and pay for damages from extreme weather. In paragraph 23 of the declaration, leaders agreed rich countries would recommit to getting $100bn a year in climate finance to poor countries, a promise that should have been met in 2020, and double finance to adapt to climate change by 2025.Citing the unmet pledge from rich countries, Ralph Gonsalves, the prime minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, said it was important to \u201chold their feet to the fire\u201d.\u201cIt would be an awful thing if you wrote this in paragraph 23 and then in 2025 we have no money.\u201d",

Lead poisoning can cause health problems ranging from learning difficulties to infertility, brain damage and, in some cases, death.Anglo American has denied responsibility for the lead poisoning.In a joint statement, Richard Meeran, a partner at Leigh Day, and Zanele Mbuyisa, a founding partner at Mbuyisa Moleele, said: \u201cWe are extremely disappointed by the judgment, which we consider to be fundamentally flawed.Children and adults work daily, weather permitting, digging rocks out of the slag heaps next to the old lead mine at Kabwe. They break up the larger rocks to sell them for building material. The town has an estimated 6m tonnes of lead slag. Photograph: Larry C Price/Larry Price\u201cWe remain committed to securing justice for the 140,000 women and children affected by lead poisoning in Kabwe and the communities have made their intention to appeal very clear,\u201d they said.In a 126-page judgment delivered on 15 December, Justice Leonie Windell, of the Johannesburg high court, said: \u201cThe applicants seek permission to advance an untenable claim that would set a grave precedent.\u201cThe precedent is that a business could be held liable half a century after its activities have ceased, to generations not yet born, as a result of being tested against future knowledge and standards unknown at the time.\u201dThe lawsuit was filed in South Africa because Zambia does not allow class-action cases and lawyers are not permitted to act on a contingency-fee basis.The world's most toxic town: the terrible legacy of Zambia's lead minesRead moreThe case was supported by a group of UN special rapporteurs, as well as Amnesty International. They argued that Anglo American\u2019s opposition to the class action was contrary to the company\u2019s own human rights policy and publicly stated commitment to corporate responsibility guidelines introduced by the UN in 2011.Last year, David Boyd, special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, referred to Kabwe as one of the world\u2019s most notorious \u201csacrifice zones\u201d, where local people were left to suffer the consequences of pollution they did not cause.Richard Price, legal and corporate affairs director at Anglo American, said: \u201cThis claim was entirely misconceived from the outset, both legally and factually.\u201cAs we have stated throughout, Anglo American has every sympathy for the situation in Kabwe, but we are not responsible for it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe welcome the clarity and force of the court\u2019s decision to dismiss this claim as untenable.\u201d",

It used real-time data, collected via a smartphone app, rather than relying on people\u2019s memory of how they were feeling.The research found that feelings of overcrowding increased loneliness by an average of 39%. But when people were able to see trees or the sky, or hear birds, feelings of loneliness fell by 28%. Feelings of social inclusion also cut loneliness by 21%, and when these feelings coincided with contact with nature the beneficial effect was boosted by a further 18%.The findings pointed to interventions to reduce loneliness, the researchers said: \u201cSpecific measures that increase social inclusion and contact with nature should be implemented, especially in densely populated cities.\u201dTime spent in nature is known to boost wellbeing, with woodland walks estimated to save the UK at least \u00a3185m a year in mental health costs, for example. Natural places in cities could reduce loneliness by enhancing feelings of attachment to a place, or by providing more opportunity to socialise, the researchers said.The study challenged the traditional view of cities as places that are always bad for mental health and loneliness, according to Prof Andrea Mechelli, part of the research team and an expert in early intervention in mental health at King\u2019s College London in the UK. \u201cThere can be aspects such as natural features and social inclusivity which can actually decrease loneliness,\u201d he added.Michael Smythe, an artist who works on social architecture and urban landscapes and was part of the study team, said: \u201cFor people like us who work with public space, validating the anecdotal knowledge we get on the ground with data is incredibly valuable in communicating the worth of these spaces. Environmental health and public health are one and the same.\u201d\u2018These salt marshes saved my life\u2019: how nature is helping mental healthRead moreThe research, published in the Scientific Reports journal, collected data from urban citizens across the world using the Urban Mind research app. People were prompted at three random times a day for a fortnight, during waking hours, to answer simple questions on loneliness, overcrowding, social inclusion and contact with nature.More than 750 people provided 16,600 of these assessments, which included the questions \u201cdo you feel welcome among [the people around you]?\u201d and \u201ccan you see trees right now?\u201d.The participants were self-selecting and so did not provide a representative sample of the wider populations. But when the researchers took age, ethnicity, education, and occupation into account, the benefits of nature contact and feelings of social inclusion on loneliness remained strongly statistically significant.Christopher Gidlow, a professor of applied health research at Staffordshire University in the UK, who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cIt has long been recognised that having access to natural environments can foster social interactions and connectedness. This study adds further weight to existing evidence of our affinity for natural environments and the potential benefits for social wellbeing.\u201cFamiliarity with environments was not measured, but is likely to be at play as people tend to visit the same natural environments. Such familiarity has been linked with feeling more connected to a place, with possible mental health benefits.\u201dJohanna Gibbons, a landscape architect and part of the research team, said: \u201cCities are probably the only habitat that is increasing at a high rate. So we should be creating urban habitats where people can thrive. Nature is a critical component of that because, I believe deep in our souls, there are really deep connections with natural forces.\u201d",

It was then gently \u201csuctioned\u201d up a tube for testing in a lab. The dive is part of the Seascape Alaska 5 expedition, which will continue until 15 September and can be followed on a livestream.The mission is exploring the Gulf of Alaska, down to depths of four miles, including deep-sea coral and sponge habitats, and geological features such as mud volcanoes.Speaking over the livestream on 30 August, when the discovery was made, team members offered theories about the identity of the object, including an egg casing or a sponge. They suggested that the hole was created by a creature hatching, or by a predator breaking in.\u201cI just hope when we poke it, something doesn\u2019t decide to come out,\u201d one scientist said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the beginning of a horror movie.\u201dOn images taken from the ocean floor, the object had a golden appearance, but this was attributed to the reflection from the submarine\u2019s headlights. A photo of the object taken in the lab suggests a brown-yellow colour.Several species, including deep-sea fish such as sharks, lay their egg cases on the sea floor, which makes them less likely to be washed away by ocean currents. Sponges are simple aquatic animals with dense, porous, skeletons that attach themselves to rocks.Prof Kerry Howell, a deep-sea ecologist at the University of Plymouth, said that it is not unusual to find new species during exploratory missions, but that it would normally be possible to place them in a broad taxonomic category.\u201cWe\u2019ll often see new things but will usually have a pretty good knowledge of what they are.

But it doesn\u2019t look like any egg I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d she added.\u201cIf it is an egg, the really interesting question is whose egg is it. It\u2019s quite big.

How can we comprehend overwhelmingly large events such as the melting of the ice caps at the same time as trying to do something about it? Can the shifting perspectives of puppetry and an object-theatre world, where vast landscapes are rendered in miniature and street-level problems are viewed from above, allow us to think afresh about questions that otherwise seem too close for comfort?Two shows in Edinburgh attempt to come up with an answer. Running in the international festival, Dimanche (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606) is a collaboration between Focus and Chaliwat\u00e9, two Belgian puppetry and physical theatre companies, and uses a jokey cartoon-like format to take us on a global tour of environmental disasters. In their roles as a wildlife documentary crew, the performers Julie Tenret, Sicaire Durieux and Sandrine Heyraud (who also write and direct) come to an unfortunate end as the ice cracks, the waters rise and the storms brew.As a piece of stagecraft, Dimanche is formidably done. It is not only the variety of techniques, ranging from the manipulation of miniature figures to mime and large-scale puppetry (cute polar bear alert). It is also the astonishing speed with which one scene dissolves into the next: a domestic interior complete with operating chairlift takes the place of an Arctic landscape in an instant.One minute, the undulations of a human body will form the hills and valleys over which toy cars will crawl. The next, a full-size canoe will paddle across rising waters or a performer will dangle precariously from a helicopter\u2019s rope ladder. The inventiveness is constant, be it a house appearing on the underside of an actor\u2019s foot or a playful routine involving an attempt to light a cigarette in a vehicle negotiating uneven terrain. As the heat rises and the fans spin, so the very furniture starts to melt.With its combination of slow-paced visual comedy and images of tsunamis, typhoons and devastated landscapes, it is like an apocalyptic Jacques Tati. And in that sense, Dimanche sits uneasily within the world it is describing. Should we be delighted by the pulsating hands caught in a sidelight like a shoal of fish or should we be alarmed by a vision of a flooded city? Are environmental catastrophes merely material for a set of clever skits, just something else to laugh about?Making connections \u2026 Alex Bird in Concerned Others at Summerhall.

Later, we see the shoe-box interiors they inhabit as the show makes the connection between addiction and social ills such as sexual abuse, poverty, poor housing and a lack of decent jobs.

However, after lobbying from the National Farmers\u2019 Union (NFU), including at least two meetings with ministers, the guidance was watered down.According to internal guidance revealed by the investigations website openDemocracy, polluting farmers may not even be informed of their rule-breaking.Some farm businesses pollute waterways by spreading excess animal waste on their land. When it rains, this runs off into local rivers, causing nutrient pollution and in severe cases, ecosystem collapse. Natural England recently downgraded the status of the River Wye, a designated special area of conservation, due to a decline of key species. The decline is due partly to large quantities of manure being washed into the river from nearby farms.In August 2021, the NFU met Lord Benyon, then the parliamentary undersecretary for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), to discuss the legislation. Four months later, it attended another meeting, this time with Victoria Prentis MP, then the minister of state for Defra, along with officials from the Environment Agency and the British Egg Industry Council and British Poultry Council, two trade associations representing farmers.In response to a freedom of information request, Defra refused to release the minutes of this second meeting, claiming policymaking in this area was \u201cstill ongoing\u201d and that releasing this information could \u201crisk inhibiting officials from having full, frank and open discussions as part of the process of formulating policy\u201d.But in written evidence submitted to parliament\u2019s environment, food and rural affairs committee, the NFU said it was decided in this meeting that an Environment Agency team tasked with implementing the legislation would have its terms of reference \u201crewritten\u201d to \u201creflect our dialogue\u201d.The guidance now says: \u201cWhere a land manager has acted in accordance with the statutory guidance, we will not inform them that they are non-compliant with the FRfW (farming rules for water).\u201d It allows manure to be spread in direct contradiction with the rules, as long as all \u201creasonable precautions\u201d are taken to reduce pollution, or in circumstances when reducing manure use is not \u201creasonably practicable\u201d.\u201cThe regulations have not changed,\u201d the document states, but goes on to say that enforcement action will not usually be taken providing farmers \u201ccan demonstrate that they are operating in accordance with the statutory guidance even if they are not compliant with regulation 4(1)(a)(i) and (ii)\u201d.These specific regulations are in place to limit how much poultry manure can be spread on farmland, ensuring that nutrients \u201c[do] not exceed the soil and crop needs or give rise to a significant risk of agricultural diffuse pollution\u201d.Charles Watson, the founder and chairperson of River Action UK, said: \u201cThat loophole is why the soils are now overloaded several times above and beyond what they can take. It is cause and effect, black and white.\u201cThe River Wye has basically turned into a green pea soup. It smells, and what used to be beautiful clean gravel on the riverbed is covered with green slime. The river is now very close to complete ecological collapse.\u201dAn Environment Agency spokesperson said: \u201cThe farming rules for water are one of a number of regulations we use as part of our advice-led regulatory approach with farmers, to protect water quality and nature. If we find pollution or significant risk of pollution occurring we will not hesitate to take further action \u2013 evidenced by the enforcement action being taken against 140 farms this financial year.\u201dThe NFU deputy president, Tom Bradshaw, said: \u201cFarmers are working hard, through a range of voluntary measures, to prevent valuable nutrients and soil from contributing to water pollution. We can and want to do more and are working with government, local authorities and regulatory bodies to find solutions to address farming\u2019s impact, so that we can better maintain and protect the health of our rivers.\u201cWith a growing population, there is a clear need for sustainable, affordable and environmentally friendly food. We will continue to work closely with partners and stakeholders across all sectors so that collectively we can drive improvements that benefit water quality in our rivers.\u201d This article was amended on 13 July 2023 to refer to England in the headline, rather than the UK.",

This is a vital part of our plan to have enough homegrown clean energy, bringing bills down for families and strengthening our energy independence.\u201dConcerns within the offshore wind industry reached a peak after none of the companies hoping to build offshore windfarms in the UK took part in the government\u2019s most recent annual clean energy auction in September.The government started its failed auction at a price of \u00a344 a MWh after the previous round of bidding led to record low contract prices of just over \u00a337 a MWh. Offshore wind developers had repeatedly warned officials that the ceiling price was set too low to make the projects economically viable.That auction was described as \u201can energy security disaster\u201d by the Labour party, which said that the UK could miss out on billions of pounds in investment and face higher energy bills if the UK\u2019s plan to triple its offshore wind power capacity by 2030 was derailed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

C\u00f3rdoba reached a record 38.8C on Thursday.Spain has been in drought since January last year and this is likely to be the hottest, driest April on record.Meanwhile, British growers have also been facing weather challenges, particularly the cold start to the spring growing season and a lack of sunlight.Fresh produce grown in Spain for UK consumption includes tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuces, broccoli and citrus fruit.Sainsbury\u2019s has warned of further shortages this week. Its chief executive, Simon Roberts, said some problems with fresh produce, such as peppers and eggs, remained.Waitrose, owned by the John Lewis Partnership, said: \u201cWe\u2019re working hard with our suppliers to get our full range [of peppers] back on our shelves and expect stock levels to stabilise in the coming weeks as we move into the UK season.\u201dThe British Retail Consortium has said difficult weather conditions in the south of Europe disrupted the harvest for some fruit and vegetables including peppers, and Morrisons limited customers to two packs of red peppers earlier this week, although plans to lift restrictions on Monday.Supermarket shelves had big gaps in February, when retailers including Tesco, Aldi, Asda and Morrisons rationed certain products such as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers. The shortages also pushed prices of fresh fruit and vegetables sharply higher.Many UK salad crop producers delayed planting fruit and vegetables because the cold weather made them even more reliant on energy for heating and lighting their glasshouses.Those who did plant crops including cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes and aubergines waited until late March to try to avoid soaring energy bills, according to Lee Stiles from the Lea Valley Growers Association.This pushed back the start of picking to mid-April, when domestic crops have usually started to displace overseas imports, and caused some shortages in domestic supply and led to gaps on supermarket shelves.The lack of spring sunshine had also had an impact, Stiles said: \u201cCurrently crops are looking good yet [their growth is] slightly slower due to the light levels.

There\u2019s no free lunch. And that cost includes that the longer the period of overshoot, there will be additional global warming, and there will be consequences of increased warming. There is also the possibility of positive feedback from that additional warming, creating more losses and damages during the overshoot period,\u201d he warned. \u201cSo one wishes to avoid such an overshoot scenario.\u201dThe IPCC warned in its latest comprehensive report on climate science, published in three parts from 2021 to 2022 with a fourth summary chapter delivered in March, that it was \u201cnow or never\u201d to take action on emissions, if the world was to have a chance of avoiding the worst ravages of climate breakdown.Governments must make their own decisions on whether to use carbon capture and storage technology, Lee said, as the IPCC advised only on science, and was neutral on policy. \u201cCCS technologies are all part of the solutions,\u201d he told the Guardian in an interview, at  in Bonn, where preparatory talks for the Cop28 UN climate summit are taking place this week and next. \u201cThe way to stay within the carbon budget is that [high-carbon] infrastructures should be equipped with some measures of emissions reductions. Our report very clearly indicates that unabated fossil fuels has to be changed, with some measures that can reduce carbon emissions.\u201dSome representatives of fossil fuel interests have been arguing that the latest IPCC report justifies their continued production of oil and gas, citing a finding that a small amount of oil and gas production in 2050 was compatible with the need to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by that date.But one IPCC author told the Guardian that while the IPCC had found some oil and gas could still be produced in 2050, while sticking to the 1.5C limit, fossil fuel producers should not conclude from this that they could keep operating. \u201cWe need to reduce fossil fuels drastically,\u201d the author said.Mark Maslin, professor of earth system science at University College London, said: \u201cJust because there is an understanding that complete removal of fossil fuel use would be almost impossible in this century is no justification to expand production. When we are aiming of a global net zero emission world by 2050 \u2013 this means no new fossil production now, halving production over the next 10 years and reducing it as close to zero as possible by 2050. None of this in any way justifies countries expanding their fossil fuel production and to use the IPCC as an excuse is dishonest and a misuse of the science.\u201dProf Michael Mann, climatologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told the Guardian that oil producers were misrepresenting the IPCC\u2019s findings if they argued for a continued use of fossil fuels. \u201cThe IPCC doesn\u2019t weigh in what energy sources will or will not be needed decades from now. While low levels of carbon emissions could be offset with negative emissions technology by 2050, there is no room in such scenarios for substantive reliance on oil, gas, or coal decades from now if we are to achieve the necessary reductions.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The horses, sometimes described as brumbies, have been found to threaten plants and animals by grazing, trampling vegetation and damaging waterways.Kosciuszko brumby numbers surge, prompting accusations of \u2018shameful\u2019 NSW mismanagementRead more\u201cIt has been made clear that if feral horse populations are not urgently managed, there is a real risk of losing this unique landscape and the native species that call it home,\u201d the committee said.The report said NSW laws protecting feral horses from culling had led to an exponential increase in the population. Data released earlier this year suggested the population grew by 4,000 over two years.The committee recommended the state government address this in part by updating the Kosciuszko National Park Wild Horse Heritage Management Plan to allow aerial shooting to help control numbers.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe NSW government has already indicated it may head in this direction. In August it announced a new plan to deal with horse numbers, and recently began public consultation on allowing aerial culling to meet a commitment to cut the population within the state to 3,000 by mid-2027. The ACT and Victoria already allow aerial shooting, but Victoria has not used it.Coalition senators on the committee published a dissenting report, arguing \u201cthe Australian brumby is an important icon of Australian culture\u201d that had \u201ccoexisted with humans, and a multitude of other animal and plant species, for over 200 years\u201d.They accused the inquiry of relying on anecdotal data, and said aerial shooting should not be used until \u201call other control methods\u201d \u2013 including fertility control, mustering and trapping, exclusion fencing and ground culling \u2013 had been tried.The independent senator David Pocock, who instigated the inquiry with the support of the government and Greens, said the report documented compelling evidence of a catastrophic impact from feral horses, including threatening 12 plants and animals and the quality of 30% of the water in the Murray-Darling Basin.He said all jurisdictions should adopt a \u201czero tolerance approach to feral horse management\u201d.\u201cHorses are beautiful animals but the evidence to this inquiry documents beyond a doubt that they do not belong in our national parks,\u201d he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So let\u2019s make the most of it by with a recipe that celebrates the entire asparagus all the way from its fibrous butt to the delicate tip. I like thick stems of asparagus best, but their bases can be tough. Cutting them into thin rounds should be enough to make them palatable and delicious.Asparagus, wild garlic and almond tartWild garlic and asparagus come into season at about the same time and pair really well, as evidenced by today\u2019s creamy tart. If you can\u2019t find or forage wild garlic, any other green leaf will do, including nettle tops, spinach or kale; otherwise, simply add more leeks.Cracking an egg to make an egg wash usually creates a surplus, because so little of it is actually needed for that task. Instead, crack the eggs for the tart filling into a bowl and use some of that as your egg wash, before adding the cream or any other filling ingredients. The amount you\u2019ll use is so negligible, it won\u2019t affect the recipe. And use any excess pastry to make my malfatti biscuits, topped with emmental and seeds.Serves 6-8For the shortcrust pastry case200g wholewheat flour, preferably spelt, plus extra for dusting100g cold butter, cut into small cubesSalt and black pepper1 eggFor the filling3 eggs350ml double cream1 bunch asparagus 100g dark green leek tops, finely sliced30g butter100g wild garlic, or an other leafy green such as spinach or kale200g cheese odds and ends (eg, goat\u2019s cheese, cheddar and wensleydale), cut into small cubes50g almond sliversTo make the pastry case, put the flour, butter and a pinch of salt in a blender and blitz until the butter is combined finely into the flour. Add the egg and a tablespoon of cold water, then pulse three to five times. Open the top and squeeze together a lump of the pastry \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t form into a ball, add another tablespoon of water and pulse again. Repeat if necessary. Turn out the pastry on to a worktop, then, using your hands, bring it together into a ball. Put in a bowl, cover and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to about 5mm thick, then use the pastry to line a greased 20cm tart case, making sure you push it right down into the base and corners. Trim any excess pastry, but leave a few millimetres overhanging the lip to counteract the pastry shrinking (keep any offcuts to make biscuits and bake them alongside the tart case). Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Prick the base all over with a fork to help stop the pastry puffing up, then bake for 20 minutes, or until just cooked.Meanwhile, make the filling. Whisk the three eggs in a large bowl, leaving a little to egg-wash the cooked pastry. Using a pastry brush, paint a layer of egg over the pastry, which will fill any holes or cracks that may have appeared. Return the tart case to the oven for three minutes, then leave to cool.Whisk the double cream into the egg bowl, and season generously.Cut the asparagus into 10cm lengths, then cut these in half lengthways through the tips. Cut the asparagus offcuts into roughly 1cm-thick rounds (if the butt ends are very fibrous, peel them before cutting).Saute the leek tops in the butter for five minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the chopped asparagus ends, add the wild garlic (stalks finely chopped, leaves roughly shredded), and cook for two minutes more.

The early scenes, set in 2001, establish the affectionate friendship between Devon dairy farmer Michael (David Fielder), recently widowed and judging by the beard eligible for a pension soon, and local veterinarian Jeff (Nigel Hastings), a younger man with a budding drink problem.When foot-and-mouth disease reaches their neck of the moors, Jeff is compelled to put down Michael\u2019s entire herd according to governmental guidelines. Michael tries to resist with an unloaded shotgun and some choice curse words aimed at the ministerial enforcers who accompany Jeff, but there\u2019s no stopping the forces of change. As the years pass, agriculture itself comes under threat in a rural economy increasingly skewing towards offering hospitality for wealthy visitors who want to capture sunsets on Instagram rather than see where their meat and milk comes from.It\u2019s a shame that Paul Robinson\u2019s direction and Fielder and Hastings\u2019 performances fail to liberate the film from its stagy origins, because the core concept is pretty compelling. The incremental sociological shifts that have unfolded in rural Britain over the last 20 years or so are indeed fertile soil, ripe for dramatic ploughing. But Roberts\u2019s screenplay only glancingly engages with the issues, in big brushstroke fashion. There are lots of problems that would have affected characters like Michael and Jeff that might have been germane, such as the impact of Brexit or resistance to the foxhunting ban.Alas, the focus is on more quotidian, smaller-scale travails, such as Michael\u2019s fundamental loneliness and Jeff\u2019s crumbling marriage, although the self-imposed restriction to just two speaking parts undermines the exploration of those arcs in any depth. Ultimately, the slushy musical score and prettified cinematography \u2013 everything seems to happen at magic hour \u2013 prove more irritating than enhancing. Even the title\u2019s inelegant plod of monosyllables comes off as somehow annoying and pretentious.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Film WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The organisation says the government must engage with the demands by 5pm on Monday, and that if it does not, \u201cunprecedented\u201d civil disobedience will follow.The organisers say the main focus of this weekend, however, is creating a welcoming space for people to come and protest about the climate crisis, with no disruption.\u201cWe want to bring people together, to create a space where people feel they can make their voices heard,\u201d said a spokesperson for XR. \u201cThis is not going to be about disruption, it\u2019s about bringing more people and more big groups together \u2013 unions, social justice groups, environmental groups, some of whom have never worked together before.

The coalition includes unions, environment groups, social justice groups and some businesses; among the signatories are Keep Britain Tidy, Avaaz, Friends of the Earth, Ecotricity, Patagonia and Cafod.On Friday there will be pickets outside various government departments in Westminster, and on Saturday a large family-friendly march is planned.

There is a real appetite to get out there.\u201dHe said the timing was important, coming in advance of the latest Public Order Act, which has raised huge concerns about the right to protest. \u201cThe powers to stop and search that are included in that bill could potentially have a real chilling effect on protest. We need to show we can still get out there in the face of an unprecedented assault on our civil rights,\u201d he said.Jemima Hartshorn, of Mums for Lungs, one of the organisations that has signed up to support the protests, said: \u201cWe know that the majority of people feel very passionately and strongly about the climate crisis.

The \u201clow birth weight-high obesity risk paradox\u201d was previously associated with tobacco smoke exposure during fetal development.\u201cSomething similar is going on with PFAS,\u201d said Joe Braun, a Brown University researcher and study co-author.Chemical industry used big tobacco\u2019s tactics to conceal evidence of PFAS risksRead morePFAS are a class of about 15,000 chemicals often used to make products resistant to water, stains and heat. The compounds are ubiquitous, and linked at low levels of exposure to cancer, thyroid disease, kidney dysfunction, birth defects, autoimmune disease and other serious health problems. They are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally degrade in the environment.A recent review of published research found PFAS in umbilical cord blood in all approximately 30,000 samples collectively checked in the studies.Though previous research found evidence suggesting the chemicals are linked to obesity early and later in life, including some research from the new study\u2019s authors, the findings were generally inconclusive. The authors say the new research is more definitive because it included a larger sample size, greater geographic coverage, longer timespan and a wider range of exposure levels.As with tobacco smoke exposure, babies who are born underweight due to PFAS exposure can experience a rapid catch-up in weight, but not height, and the weight gain happens earlier than for children who will be a normal weight, Braun said.The precise reason PFAS cause these issues is not known for certain, said Jamie Liu, a Brown researcher and study co-author, but she added she suspected the chemicals affect DNA methylation.The methylation process is related to how the body produces cells, which all have the same DNA. Methylation is part of the mechanism that creates different cells \u2013 it determines which cell is an eye cell and which is a kidney cell, for example.During prenatal development, DNA methylation is one of the \u201cswitches that tells the body \u2018this is how life is going to be on the outside\u2019\u201d, Braun said.The authors last year examined markers of DNA methylation in white blood cells and found PFAS exposure seemed to change how the body metabolizes energy from birth up to 12 years of age, which could affect growth.\u201cPFAS seem to have a programming effect \u2026 that lasted for up to 12 years,\u201d Braun said. Overall, the research found about a 12% increase in the likelihood of obesity among PFAS-exposed fetuses.Those who are exposed can mitigate the effects later in life through regular exercise, Braun said, but it is difficult for mothers to protect themselves and their fetuses because PFAS are so widely used. The US government estimates the chemicals are in 98% of Americans\u2019 blood, and they often have long half-lives, so PFAS from an exposure years before a pregnancy could still harm a fetus.But, broadly speaking, people can take some steps to reduce PFAS exposure, Braun said. That includes filtering water \u2013 the chemicals are thought to be contaminating drinking water for more than 200 million Americans. Indoor dust is another major exposure route, and using a vacuum cleaner that has a Hepa filter can remove contaminants from the indoor environment, Braun said.Food represents perhaps the most significant exposure route, in part because the chemicals are frequently used in food packaging. Eating fresh foods that are not in packaging and pursuing a balanced diet could be beneficial, Braun added.\u201cThose are probably the three best things you can do to hedge your bets,\u201d he said.",

She was the last captive orca in Canada.In one of the last recorded videos of her, she drifts listlessly in aquamarine water as a boy behind the glass wall tries to get her attention. \u201cKis-kaaa! Kis-kaa! Kis-kaaa!\u201d he calls as the whale floats by, seemingly oblivious.But while the Ontario government\u2019s announcement that Kiska had died in captivity last week, reportedly from a bacterial infection at an estimated 47 years old, was received with widespread grief, marine activists also credit the whale with inspiring tangible change in protection for marine animals.Kiska\u2019s death comes four years after Canada passed bill S-203, banning the captivity and breeding of whales, dolphins and porpoises. Although the new law was too late for Kiska \u2013 individuals already in captivity were excluded from protection \u2013 activists say her story was instrumental in drawing public attention to the plight of captive marine mammals.There\u2019s very little positive to take away from Kiska\u2019s death \u2026 but at least she will be recognised as the lastPhil Demers, campaignerSince the bill, campaigners had been working hard to free Kiska, protesting on the streets of Niagara Falls, lodging legal complaints and drafting plans to secure her release from MarineLand.\u201cWhen I heard that Kiska died, I just bawled, which I almost never do,\u201d says Camille Labchuk, executive director of the Toronto campaign group Animal Justice.\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating for so many people because it felt like we were so close to being able to get her out and she just couldn\u2019t hold on long enough.\u201dCaptured off Iceland along with Keiko, the orca in the film Free Willy, in 1979, Kiska was soon transferred to MarineLand, where the two orcas lived together. Keiko was later sold to a Mexican entertainment park, then finally rehabilitated and released back into her Icelandic home waters.Kiska swims in her concrete tank in Niagara Falls last month. Photograph: Phil Demers/@Urgenseas/ReutersKiska, however, remained at MarineLand, where she gave birth to five calves, none of which survived. Her final tank mate was Ikaika, son of Tilikum, the whale that killed three people and featured in the 2013 documentary, Blackfish.\u201cThere were times when we had to separate them because Kiska needed a break,\u201d says Christine Santos, a former trainer turned activist who worked closely with the two whales. \u201cShe just wanted to get away from this young male who just kept going at her.\u201d In 2011, Kiska got her reprieve when Ikaika was flown back to California and his original owner, SeaWorld. No replacement was brought in for Ikaika and so began Kiska\u2019s long period of isolation.For years, accusations of substandard animal care dogged MarineLand. In 2012, the Toronto Star published a series of stories in which eight former staff members, including Santos and her partner, Phil Demers, alleged that poor water quality and insufficient staffing caused animal suffering at the park. Lawsuits flew back and forth between activists and the theme park, and the government launched various investigations.Since January 2020, Ontario\u2019s Provincial Animal Welfare Services has inspected MarineLand 160 times.In a statement, MarineLand said its \u201cmarine mammal care team and experts did everything possible to support Kiska\u2019s comfort and will mourn her loss\u201d, and did not return requests for comment.Ships are turning whales into \u2018ocean roadkill\u2019.

In the summer of 2021, Demers posted the video of a listless Kiska as the boy calls to her, then in October another of the orca bashing her head against the walls of her tank.Efforts to free Kiska at the time failed. A proposed whale sanctuary in Nova Scotia has not become operational, while plans to move her to an aquarium with other marine mammals did not materialise.Animal Justice is calling on the Ontario government to release the results of Kiska\u2019s postmortem examination, and Demers is pushing for the remaining animals at MarineLand \u2013 including belugas, dolphins and sea lions \u2013 to be removed.\u201cThere\u2019s very little positive to take away from Kiska\u2019s death, but a lot of animals have died similarly, whereas at least she will be recognised as the last, and the orca that largely created and inspired bill S-203,\u201d says Demers.",

Here\u2019s why, 29 April).This is not a novel view; it is a point well made already by Nafeez Ahmed in his critique of non-violent direct action. Anti-colonial resistance in India, for example, originated from within the oppressed communities themselves. Their aim was to force the British state to respond with such violence that the brutality of the colonial regime became apparent to the majority of the British people, whose tacit consent had been necessary for the continuation of the colonial enterprise.No such context exists today. All of us in the global north are complicit in, and beneficiaries of, the fossil fuel economy.

But we also need to use our democratic rights to build political support for the tough actions needed to tackle the climate crisis. Politicians fear losing votes more than anything else: this fear gave us the Scottish parliament, the referendum on Brexit, and the abolition of the fuel tax escalator, following direct action by lorry drivers in 2000. Local elections this week and the general election enable us to vote for decisive action on climate. We also need to lobby parties, councillors and MPs to address the existential threats to humanity.

The projects include onshore and offshore wind, solar farms and battery storage businesses, and the first terminations are expected next year.The regulator said on Monday it would hand National Grid\u2019s electricity system operator (ESO), which controls the process, the power to terminate projects that were not progressing against their specific milestones, including proof of funding or planning permission. It will apply to all projects with a connection date after November 2025.The ESO has said that between 60% and 70% of projects in the queue \u201cultimately fail to materialise or connect\u201d. The number of projects waiting in line rose from 600 in May to 1,000 by September.The average time between requesting a connection and being offered one has increased from 18 months in 2019-20 to five years in 2023.Ofgem said that, if the current projects in the queue were all developed, it would generate 400 gigawatts (GW) of power, far outstripping the UK\u2019s existing power capacity of about 65GW. However, more than 40% of that is in held-up contracts with connection dates of 2030 or later; some are as late as 2037.Eleanor Warburton, an Ofgem director, said: \u201cThe transition to net zero demands urgent changes to the electricity connections system \u2013 or we cannot unlock investment, speed up network build and accelerate new technology.\u201cThis is a big step towards phasing out the first come, first served queueing system. We want new power on the grid as quickly as possible, so if you\u2019re ready, you can connect sooner.\u201cIf you\u2019re not ready and are blocking the progress of others, you\u2019ll be removed \u2013 you can\u2019t sit on the queue with no consequences.\u201dJulian Leslie, the chief engineer and head of networks at the ESO, said: \u201cWe warmly welcome these new rules approved by Ofgem enabling us to proactively terminate zombie projects in the connections queue.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is now expected to offer higher subsidies to the companies, which have faced rising costs.A package of measures to speed up grid connections is expected to be announced in the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement on 22 November.Separately, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) said on Monday that the oil market remained \u201chealthy\u201d, despite a weakening in prices to $82 (\u00a367) a barrel for Brent crude from highs of nearly $98 in late September.The group of oil-producing nations said strong Chinese imports and \u201crobust\u201d trading were supporting the market despite concern about economic growth and demand.

        "text": "Environmental groups in Canada are taking legal action against the country\u2019s environment minister, arguing his delay in protecting old growth forest is harming the critically endangered northern spotted owl.In February, Steven Guilbeault said he would recommend an emergency order after determining the species was facing \u201cimminent threats\u201d to its survival.Emergency orders are a powerful tool under Canada\u2019s endangered species legislation and have been used only three times in the country\u2019s history, including once by Guilbeault. They grant the federal government jurisdiction over decisions typically reserved for a province, including the ability to dictate which forests are off limits to logging.Decades of old growth clearcutting have wiped out much of the northern spotted owl\u2019s habitat in British Columbia, leaving the wild population in Canada at just one female, down from about 40 breeding pairs in the 90s.The minister initially determined that old-growth logging must stop within an area of the Sp\u00f4\u2019z\u00eam Nation territory, including the Spuzzum and Utzlius watersheds, as well as a further 2,500 hectares (6,200 acres) of forest habitat at risk. But in the four months since Guilbeault announced plans for an emergency order, environmental groups say he has failed to follow through.\u201cThe minister is legally obligated to make an emergency order recommendation to cabinet to protect this iconic species \u2013 any further delay is unacceptable,\u201d said Rachel Gutman, a lawyer with Ecojustice, which is representing the advocacy group Wilderness Committee. \u201cWith the logging season upon us and only one owl remaining in the wild, the failure to immediately protect the species\u2019 remaining habitat risks the extirpation of the spotted owl from Canada.\u201dOnly one spotted owl remains in the wild in Canada. Photograph: Jesse Winter/The GuardianJoe Foy, a spokesperson for Wilderness Committee, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been insanely patient as we wait for the federal government to put their spotted owl recovery strategy in place and for the minister to recommend an emergency order, even though we\u2019ve watched spotted owl numbers dwindle down extremely low. But the situation we\u2019re in now is alarming.\u201dIn late May, Foy and Geoff Senichenko, a mapper with Wilderness Committee, travelled to areas in British Columbia that the federal government had previously indicated would become \u201ccritical habitat\u201d as part of its spotted owl recovery plan, a powerful designation which would halt logging under federal law.Foy alleges logging companies have raced to harvest those areas before they are formally designated off limits. \u201cWe saw areas that had been mapped as critical habitat already logged, we saw areas where there\u2019s critical habitat being logged right now. And we saw areas of standing forest marked as critical habitat in the federal government\u2019s draft spotted owl recovery plan that are pending approval for logging,\u201d he said.\u201cWe\u2019re in a very dire situation. The forest is broken and the federal government has a plan to fix it. But if those forests are logged, it would make the recovery of spotted owls highly unlikely.\u201dIn an interview with the Guardian in April, Guilbeault said he was wary of recommending the emergency order to cabinet because of concerns it could \u201cseriously degrade\u201d the relationship between the province of British Columbia and the federal government, stalling efforts to save a number of other species, including caribou.\u2018All I see are ghosts\u2019: fear and fury as the last spotted owl in Canada fights for survivalRead more\u201cThe reality is, it\u2019s a last-resort measure. Because once you do that, there is no more collaboration,\u201d he said. However, he added that fear of damaging the relationship between federal government and the province \u201ccan\u2019t be used as an excuse for not acting\u201d.Last month, two spotted owls from a breeding programme released into the wild were found dead, highlighting the steep challenges in recovering the species. Environmental groups say more protection is needed, arguing the fate of the small predators is a glimpse into the health of the region\u2019s ancient rainforests.\u201cIt\u2019s up to citizens to try to do the right thing,\u201d Foy said of the lawsuit. \u201cClearly, we\u2019ve tried everything else.

        "text": "The climate crisis is moving into uncharted territory as much of the northern hemisphere endures a blistering heatwave, many countries are deluged with rain, sea surface temperatures reach new heights, and Antarctic sea ice new lows. A number of climate records \u2013 some unofficial \u2013 have tumbled in recent weeks.Many factors have combined for this to happen, including climate change but also the El Ni\u00f1o weather event, and the northern hemisphere summer.00:03:10What is supercharging the global heat? \u2013 video explainer\u201cThe northern hemisphere has a lot more land, it means this time of year just tends to be hotter globally than in southern hemisphere\u2019s summer,\u201d says Dr Kim Reid from Monash University.\u201cAnd so this combination of this background warming from global warming, El Ni\u00f1o and the fact that it\u2019s the hottest time of the year for the globe means that we\u2019re just seeing all these records tumbling, all at once.\u201dWhile the UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organization and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have both declared a Ni\u00f1o is in place, Australia\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology has so far held back from declaring one, saying the atmosphere is not yet giving the typical signals.This heatwave is a climate omen. But it\u2019s not too late to change course | Michael E Mann and Susan Joy HassolRead moreThe record for global average temperature has been broken a couple of times in the past few weeks, according to a model of average air temperatures at two metres, created by the NOAA. Although, as this data is derived from a model and not direct observation, it is not an \u201cofficial\u201d climate record.The model is based on observational data from weather stations, balloons, satellites and other sources and allows climate scientists to get an idea of the temperature over a wider area and create an average for the entire globe.The chart above shows the global average derived from the model, but maps also show the positive temperature anomalies \u2013 the difference between current temperatures and the long-run average \u2013 spread across much of the Earth\u2019s surface in June.High temperatures were recorded across much of the world in JuneEven as the air temperatures have been elevated, the NOAA models show sea surface temperatures are also higher than in recent decades. Monthly data shows that the temperature anomaly has been positive and on an upward trend for decades.The ocean stores a lot of the excess heat from global heating \u2013 up to 90% in recent decades.\u201cBecause we\u2019ve had La Ni\u00f1a the last few years, a lot of the heat has gone into the ocean,\u201d Reid says. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of been hidden from us at the surface for a bit. And now as we\u2019ve flipped from La Ni\u00f1a into El Ni\u00f1o, a lot of this ocean heat is now rising up to the surface.\u201dchartWhile the air and sea surface are seeing greater than average heat, new records are being set for sea ice in Antarctica \u2013 for how little there is. The lack of sea ice extent is continuing a trend \u2013 a new record has been set several times over the past few years.Satellite data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center shows that not only is 2023 a significant outlier, 2022 ended with some of the lowest sea ice extents on record. But the gap to the long-run average for this time of year appears to be getting larger.\u201dBut Reid warns that the Earth \u2013 the climate \u2013 is a complex system, with many moving parts. What is happening to sea ice in Antarctica, for instance, also has to do with winds, storms and pressure systems.\u201cWe\u2019ve got, of course, the background climate change, we\u2019ve got the seasonality, the fact that it\u2019s summer, the fact that it\u2019s now El Ni\u00f1o, and then there\u2019s also what we call effects from aerosols. So these are tiny particles like sulphur dust, sea salt, that can reflect incoming solar radiation. And [all this] can control the planet\u2019s temperature.\u201d",

        "text": "Exposure to air pollution harms our health, and reducing air pollution saves money. These were the two of the main messages from last month\u2019s conference of air pollution scientists in Brussels. Held just a few hundred metres from the European Commission, it sent a clear message to EU policymakers about the opportunities from adopting ambitious targets.Each year across the 27 EU member states about 412,000 people die early from particle pollution, but this is just part of the impact. Air pollution is also a factor in many of our chronic diseases; it harms our health from before birth, through childhood and into our old age.Prof Barbara Hoffman, of the University of D\u00fcsseldorf, said: \u201cAir pollution at current European levels is not for free \u2013 it comes at great costs in terms of hospital care, loss of working days, work incapacity and reduced intelligence in kids. All this translates into a huge and preventable expense.\u201dNew EU proposals fall short of adopting World Health Organization guidelines but would reduce legal limits for particle pollution by 60% and cut the limit for nitrogen dioxide by 50% by 2030.Objectors often cite costs as a reason for not acting. Methods for calculating costs and benefits vary between countries but the overall message is similar. The benefits from reducing the health burden from air pollution are so high that these almost always outweigh the investment.The US Clean Air Act and amendments are estimated to have saved the lives of 230,000 Americans in 2020. Add in reduced asthma, emergency room visits and days away from work and education, and the benefits add up to more than 30 times the investment. For the EU\u2019s proposal, the projected benefit is at least 10 times greater than the cost and could be as much as 35 times greater. Extra benefits will also come from less pollution damage to forestry and valuable farm crops.The UK\u2019s government\u2019s air pollution targets for England are less ambitious than the EU proposal. They have the same target for particle pollution, but aim to attain this 10 years after the EU. They do not include new limits for nitrogen dioxide. The estimated benefit is between five and six times greater than the investment.Prof Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, of Barcelona\u2019s Institute for Global Health, said: \u201cThe new EU directive, with tighter limits could be the biggest health intervention for a generation.\u201dThe World Bank estimates that the health impacts of air pollution amount to 6.1 % of global gross domestic product.

Workers on cattle farms supplying slaughterhouses earned as little as \u00a38 a day and lived in improvised shacks with no bathrooms, toilets, running water or kitchens, according to a report from Brazilian investigative agency Rep\u00f3rter Brasil.Since 1995, the report said, 55,000 Brazilian workers have been rescued by government inspectors from \u201csituations similar to slavery\u201d. While the number of investigations has fallen in recent years \u2013 118 workers were freed in 2018, compared with 1,045 a decade earlier \u2013 that does not mean the situation has improved, just that inspections have been reduced, it noted.JBS promised to control its entire supply chain by 2025. Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters\u201cWe see this as an urgent problem that the big companies have to resolve,\u201d said Marcel Gomes, executive secretary of Rep\u00f3rter Brasil and the report\u2019s editor.The report challenges meat companies such as JBS, which has faced criticism over its inability to control its supply chains of cattle farms in the Amazon.A series of investigations by the Guardian, Rep\u00f3rter Brasil, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and others have found the company bought cattle from so-called \u201cdirect supplier\u201d farms that had sourced from \u201cindirect suppliers\u201d \u2013 farms that supply cattle to be fattened and slaughtered \u2013 that had been involved in illegal deforestation.In September, JBS promised to control its entire supply chain by 2025 \u2013 14 years after it and other Brazilian companies Minerva and Marfrig originally promised to do so. The three companies signed a deal in 2009 with Greenpeace in which they agreed not to buy cattle from farms \u201cengaged in slavery\u201d. Similar deals signed with federal prosecutors stopped them buying from farms included on a rolling government \u201cdirty list\u201d for keeping workers in slavery-like conditions.Brazil meat giant JBS pledges to axe suppliers linked to deforestationRead moreIn August 2019, government inspectors found nine unregistered workers clearing pasture on the Copacabana farm in Mato Grosso do Sul state were being paid \u00a38 a day, the report said. They lived in improvised shacks made of logs, plastic, palm fronds and corrugated iron without toilets, kitchens or running water. The farm and its controller, Fernanda Thomazelli, were later included on the 2020 \u201cdirty list\u201d. The farm had sold cattle directly to two JBS slaughterhouses in 2019 and 2020.In an out of court settlement with labour law prosecutors, Thomazelli\u2019s father, Jos\u00e9, representing his daughter, agreed to register the workers and provide proper living conditions. Notes from a meeting with prosecutors recorded he did not admit the existence of \u201cwork similar to slavery\u201d. When contacted by the Guardian, he declined to comment and his daughter did not respond to an email.JBS said it blocked Copacabana and two other farms listed in the report as soon as they appeared on the \u201cdirty list\u201d, following protocols agreed with prosecutors. \u201cWe have a zero-tolerance approach to forced labour and also urge anyone who suspects or has evidence of individual or farm-level malpractice to report it,\u201d the company said.Workers process meat on a production line at the Minerva plant in Barretos. Photograph: Bloomberg/GettyThe report also cited a farm in Tocantins state that sold to another farm in December 2018, two months after being included on the \u201cdirty list\u201d for keeping a 65-year-old worker in \u201cdeplorable conditions\u201d. The second farm supplied a Minerva slaughterhouse in the state, the report alleges.Minerva, Brazil\u2019s second largest beef exporter, said it never did business with the offending farm and that the direct supplier farm was \u201cqualified\u201d to supply cattle.

Road traffic is a leading source.On Tuesday the mayor of London issued a high pollution alert for the capital as people across the UK basked in the unseasonably warm February weather. It was the first alert since last July, towards the end of a long heatwave and dry spell.London pollutionTraffic and other emissions from local sources were mainly to blame for this week\u2019s dirty air, with only light winds to disperse them and air from the continent bringing further pollutants.In April the first ultra-low emission zone will come into force in central London. The scheme is expected to cut harmful emissions by as much as 45%, according to the mayor\u2019s office.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said high levels of particulate matter in the air were also recorded in the past few days in the East and West Midlands. Other regions were also expected to experience localised pollution in hotspots, carrying on at least into Wednesday.The new map of nitrogen dioxide pollution limit breaches for recent years shows that Earl\u2019s Court station in London was worst overall, with a recording of 129.5 micrograms per cubic metre, compared with the 40\u03bcg/m3 limit set out in the government\u2019s air quality objectives.Earl\u2019s Court station in London was the worst for pollution limit breaches, the map indicated. Photograph: Kevin Coombs/ReutersA monitoring station near the Ikea store in Brent, north London, recorded levels slightly above 100\u03bcg/m3 in 2016, while Kensington High Street, Euston Road and Strand in central London were all above 90\u03bcg/m3 in 2017.Air near Neville Street in Leeds was found to be just under the 100\u03bcg/m3 level, closely followed by two locations in Hickleton, Doncaster. Other hotspots included Brighton, Sheffield and Coventry, where the levels on Holyhead Road were found to be near twice the advised limit, at about 76\u03bcg/m3 in 2016.England pollutionFriends of the Earth, which mapped the sites and collated the data, said it was further evidence of the dire air quality across the country as a result of burgeoning traffic emissions and poor government controls on emissions sources. The group called for tougher action by ministers.Simon Bowens, a clean air campaigner at FoE, said: \u201cIt\u2019s unforgivable that across the UK there are nearly 2,000 locations over air quality limits, leaving millions of us breathing dangerously polluted air. The government needs to step up and do more to help deal with this air pollution crisis.

Children are most at risk: exposure to air pollution when young can have lifelong effects as it can stunt the lungs and affect intelligence.A fresh inquest into the death of Ella Kissi-Debrah, a nine-year-old from south London, is expected to be asked to consider whether her death six years ago from an asthma-related seizure could have been linked to high levels of air pollution.The data used for the map was taken from the most recent annual air quality status reports that have been submitted to government, most of them from last year, with the results adjusted for distance and other factors.

        "text": "The US Department of Energy has selected seven projects for a $7bn program to launch the development and production of hydrogen fuel, the White House announced on Friday.The Biden administration says the program will constitute a major boost to the country\u2019s nascent clean hydrogen industry, helping it achieve its climate goals. But many climate advocates are skeptical that it will actually help reduce emissions.Unlike coal, oil and gas, when burned, hydrogen does not produce greenhouse gas emissions. It can be produced using carbon-free energy, but roughly 96% of it is currently derived from planet-heating fossil fuels \u2013 something the Biden administration hopes to change.\u201cWith this historic investment, the Biden-Harris administration is laying the foundation for a new, American-led industry that will propel the global clean energy transition,\u201d said Jennifer Granholm, the secretary of energy, in a statement.The money will be awarded to proposed hydrogen projects on the Gulf Coast and in the mid-Atlantic, Appalachia, midwest, upper midwest, Pacific north-west and California. Dozens of regions competed for funds from the $7bn pot, set aside in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. On Friday, Joe Biden will travel to Philadelphia to promote the mid-Atlantic hub.The Department of Energy says it expects the funding to help cut 25m metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually, the equivalent of removing 5.5m gasoline-powered vehicles from the road each year.But some experts say the new initiative could amount to little more than greenwashing. Though researchers agree that truly clean hydrogen, produced without fossil fuels, can fulfill certain crucial roles in hard-to-decarbonize sectors, including in the production of synthetic fertilizers and steel, studies have found it to be much less efficient for home heating and transportation than technologies such as heat pumps and electric vehicles.\u201cDirect electrification and batteries offer so much more, and much more quickly,\u201d Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, told the Guardian this year.Despite this, fossil fuel companies have spent years promoting hydrogen production as a catch-all climate solution. Some have used the hope of clean hydrogen to justify building more pipelines, claiming that they can be used to transport the climate-friendly fuel in the future.Climate advocates also note that hydrogen production, even when powered by renewable energy, can be highly water intensive. And since hydrogen is also a highly flammable and corrosive element, it can create risk for workers.Oil companies often say fossil fuels can power hydrogen production, so long as any emissions produced are trapped with carbon capture and kept out of the atmosphere.But carbon capture technology is not currently available at commercial scale, and a 2021 paper co-authored by Haworth found that using methane gas paired with carbon capture to produce so-called \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen for home heating could produce more climate-warming pollution burning gas, coal or diesel oil.\u201cAt face value \u2013 and according to the Biden playbook \u2013 the hydrogen hub grants aim to help transition the United States to clean energy,\u201d said Marion Gee, the co-executive director at the Climate Justice Alliance, a national coalition of grassroots environmental justice groups. \u201cIn reality, they amount to another corporate scam, one that preserves and extends the life of the extractive economy and prevents the frontline communities most impacted by climate disaster from having input.\u201dJulie McNamara, the deputy policy director of the science and climate advocacy organization Union of Concerned Scientists, said the administration should impose stricter regulations on the hydrogen hubs to boost community input and ensure only completely fossil-free projects receive funding.\u201cConcerningly, today\u2019s H2Hubs announcement advances multiple projects premised on fossil fuel-based hydrogen production and risky hydrogen end uses,\u201d she said. \u201cBillions of taxpayer dollars are at risk of perpetuating fossil fuel industry injustices and harms while subsidizing fossil fuel greenwashing.\u201d",

The order came after residents reported a fuel smell in their water. Officials said that a generator at the plant spilled diesel fuel into a reservoir after the facility lost power during recent storms.They noted that 100 gallons of diesel contaminated about 4.2m gallons of water held at the plant.On Wednesday, many of the 40,000 people in the Memphis suburb of Germantown remained under an order to avoid using water for everything except flushing toilets. Officials advised using bottled water for personal use and the city has been distributing bottled water.Bottled water distribution will carry on until Friday.

This is because the poultry reared in the area produce large amounts of manure, which contains nutrients including phosphorus. Much of this is spread on the land, which can result in the phosphorus it contains entering the river.The Wildlife Trusts, which manages nature reserves across the Wye catchment, has expressed concern at the downgrading of its status and urged the government to take action.It is calling for ministers in England and Wales to place an immediate policy moratorium on any new or extended intensive livestock production units (poultry, cattle and pig) in the Wye catchment. It is also asking for farmers and supermarkets to work with nature charities to put an end to the pollution, and for farmers in the area to be rewarded for providing public goods and enabled to diversify into regenerative and sustainable methods of production which cause less pollution.Joan Edwards, the director of public affairs at the Wildlife Trusts, said: \u201cThat the Wye is in even worse condition now will come as no surprise to the people that love and live near it.

The show, entitled A Play for the Living in a Time of Extinction, is an experiment in how theatre can be more sustainable. It is staged by a local creative team and features a different performer in each venue it plays.The idea took shape at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Vidy-Lausanne in Switzerland, where the British theatre director was due to stage a show. The French choreographer J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bel had recently announced that he would no longer fly, a decision Mitchell had herself made after working with scientist Stephen Emmott on Ten Billion, staged at the Royal Court in 2012. Mitchell and Bel began discussions with producers at Vidy-Lausanne about sustainable theatre in which, says Mitchell, \u201cthe artistic conversations were intersecting with budgeting and systems and structures as well\u201d. The zero-travel rule is just one part of the initiative which is not a set-in-stone model but rather a way to prompt new ways of working on individual productions and within organisations.They still had to find a text. A Play for the Living in a Time of Extinction, by the American dramatist Miranda Rose Hall, came to Mitchell\u2019s attention after it was shortlisted for the Susan Smith Blackburn prize. It\u2019s a monologue about a stressed-out theatre worker called Naomi whose company, Zero Omissions, are touring a devised show called Climate Beasties.For a play that engages with environmental collapse and death, it is very funnyWhile conversations about climate crisis are happening on an organisational level, this doesn\u2019t always translate into the work we see on stage, says Mitchell. Hall adds that she and her company had been \u201cthinking a lot about what it would mean to generate a fictional narrative work that could attempt to grapple with the climate crisis using the tools of theatre\u201d. For a play that engages with environmental collapse and death, it is very funny. Hall was intent on bringing some buoyancy to the character of Naomi: \u201cFinding the humour in it is my way of being myself within the story.\u201dParticipating theatres in the play\u2019s UK tour \u2013 including the Belgrade in Coventry, Theatre Royal Plymouth and York Theatre Royal \u2013 will be issued with a set of guidelines called a \u201ctouring score\u201d. These state that the show should be off-grid and that the electricity must be generated during the performance. In Vidy, as in many of Mitchell\u2019s previous productions, this was done using onstage bicycles pedalled by performers. The set and costumes should also be produced locally and the use of second-hand material is encouraged.The guidelines state that Naomi, who will be portrayed by Lydia West (It\u2019s a Sin) at the Barbican run, should be played by a woman of colour or someone from an under-represented community in each iteration of the production. Each stop on the tour should also feature a local choir.\u2018I can\u2019t just be quiet in the corner, accepting everything\u2019: Lydia West on deep dives into roles \u2013 and waterRead moreAfter premiering in Lausanne in 2021, the production played various European dates including the Holland Festival and NTGent in Belgium. There was also a production in Taipei. In the UK, the theatre company Headlong will co-produce the tour.\u201cTheatre about climate collapse can often be confused with activism, but it felt like they were taking these issues seriously, which triggered me as an artist and a person,\u201d says Martha Balthazar, the young Belgian director behind the NTGent production. While she thinks it is essential \u201cto keep having this conversation,\u201d she found the lack of creative freedom frustrating at times and feels the project has some blind spots, particularly in respect to privilege. This is something Mitchell also acknowledges. \u201cZero travel is a privileged position for a lot of countries. We have to think sensitively and thoughtfully about the global south and how they might want to join the conversation,\u201d she says.There have been some hard discussions along the way, says Mitchell. \u201cIt\u2019s not been easy, but it\u2019s been healthy.\u201d And, given the experimental nature of the project, it is capable of evolving and absorbing feedback. \u201cAs a senior artist, I have a duty of care to put myself out there a bit,\u201d says Mitchell. She and Bel are established enough to take these risks. After all, she says, \u201cWe\u2019re part of the generation who created the problem.\u201d A Play for the Living in a Time of Extinction is at the Barbican, London, 26-29 April. Then touring.",

        "text": "The initial expansion of London\u2019s ultra low emissions zone (Ulez) for motor vehicles has brought notable benefits in reducing pollution, a study has found as the mayor prepares for a big extension to its boundaries.The report by officials at the Greater London authority and Transport for London could help Sadiq Khan counter a political backlash to the imminent further expansion.The report has been peer-reviewed by Dr Gary Fuller, an expert on urban pollution at Imperial College London. It calculated that since the zone was introduced four years ago, emissions of toxic nitrogen oxides, or NOx, particularly produced by diesel engines, are 23% lower across London as a whole compared with what would be their estimated level if the scheme had not been introduced, and 26% lower within the zone.Using the same metric, emissions of dangerous fine particulate matter, or PM2.5s, were calculated to be 19% lower than they would have been without the Ulez within its boundaries, and 7% lower across the whole city.The zone in which drivers of vehicles which fail to meet certain emissions standards must pay a daily fee, now \u00a312.50, was first rolled out for central London in April 2019.In October 2021 this was expanded by several miles to the edges of the north and south circular roads. At the end of August the Ulez borders are due to be extended again, covering all 32 London boroughs.A number of Conservative MPs and some councils have objected to the new expansion, arguing that people in outer boroughs rely more heavily on motor vehicles for transport, and that it is unfair to ask those with older, non-Ulez compliant models to pay for an upgrade.Khan has insisted the health and environmental toll of pollutants and other emissions justifies the action, saying the new report showed it was \u201cvital\u201d to expand the scheme.The report offers evidence that the Ulez does not appear to, as some critics warned, simply push vehicles to drive around the edge of it, with boundary roads seeing concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, one of two contributors to NOx emissions, fall by between 19% and 27% compared with the projected case without the zone.The study also includes figures for absolute levels of pollutants over the course of the zone\u2019s existence, but these can be more complex to analyse given external factors such as the impact of Covid, which saw motor traffic levels in inner London and thus emissions reduce sharply for a period.Additionally, emissions levels had been falling anyway before the Ulez was created, as newer, less-polluting vehicles emerged, meaning not all reductions can be attributed to the policy.On the impact of the 2021 expansion specifically, the report said that, on average, 74,000 fewer heavily polluting vehicles a day were being driven within the zone, a fall of 60%.Khan said the evidence of the zone\u2019s effectiveness was \u201cbeyond dispute\u201d. He said: \u201cBut there\u2019s still more to do. Toxic air is a matter of life and death with around 4,000 deaths in London attributed to air pollution in 2019. It\u2019s also stunting the growth of children\u2019s lungs and causing people to develop life-changing illnesses, such as cancer, lung disease, dementia and asthma.\u201dFuller said the evidence he reviewed showed both the initial, central London Ulez and the 2021 expansion had \u201cbrought about measurable and sustained improvements to air pollution from traffic\u201d.He said: \u201cMany people fear that traffic will simply divert around low emission zones, worsening air pollution for those that live on the boundaries. However, data from London\u2019s air pollution measurement network has shown that this has not happened. Instead, nitrogen dioxide alongside the North and South Circular roads has shown a strong improvement.\u201cMany cities in the UK and around the world are looking to follow London\u2019s lead.

By Friday afternoon, more than 50,000 people had signed a petition to save the trees.\u201cWe only found out when they started to put the barriers up,\u201d said Susana de la Higuera of the Pasillo Verde Imperial neighbourhood association.\u201cBy putting the station inside the park, they\u2019ll have to cut down more than 500 trees in the Madrid R\u00edo park, which includes what was the historic Arganzuela park, which was planted in 1969.\u201d\u2018We need trees\u2019: green vision struggles to take root in Europe\u2019s citiesRead moreDe la Higuera said the loss of the large London plane trees, which provide much-needed shade during the merciless Madrid summer, would be devastating for the community.\u201cThe people who are grandparents now took their children there and now they take their grandchildren there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s also where the schoolkids hang out because it\u2019s the only place where there\u2019s really shade. But it\u2019s a really popular park that\u2019s used not only by people from Arganzuela, but also by people from all over Madrid. We just don\u2019t understand this barbaric idea \u2013 there\u2019s no other word for it.\u201dEcologists in Action said the metro works would represent \u201cone of the greatest arboricides\u201d in Madrid\u2019s recent history.\u201cThe reasons for this decision seem to spring from the need to smooth out the management of the works and to reduce the effects on traffic as much as possible by moving construction away from the public thoroughfare,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThis is further proof of the Madrid government\u2019s disdain for our natural heritage.\u201dMadrid city council referred the Guardian to the Madrid regional government, which is leading the metro extension. The regional government did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s questions.Earlier this week, however, Madrid\u2019s mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, said \u201cnot a single tree would be lost\u201d as laws required that the 1,027 felled trees be replaced by almost 20,000 new ones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The public services are in a ruinous state; industries that have been privatised are failing. The country needs a person of integrity, vision and presence to lead Britain towards the kindly, efficient and flourishing country it could and should be. Keir Starmer has the qualities, the experience, sense of values and humanity to be that person.Yet he\u2019s timorous, afraid that Rishi Sunak has begun to \u201cweaponise\u201d this \u201cmajor Labour spending commitment\u201d. Let Sunak weaponise the subject as much as he likes, Keir, but stick to your guns. Sunak is wrong, wrong and out of his depth, grasping at anything in his desperation to keep power.If Keir Starmer wins the next election he will have the opportunity to rebuild Britain. David CurtisSolihull, West Midlands The suggestion that Labour is considering further watering down its so-called green policies in order to \u201cneutralise\u201d Tory attacks is deeply depressing. The mere idea that such a ludicrous government that retains not a scintilla of respect or credibility has some kind of embargo on another party\u2019s policies that are essential to meet the environmental and economic challenges simply brings into stark relief the malign, stultifying and reactionary effect of our sclerotic political system. Liz Truss was mocked as a lettuce; if Starmer can\u2019t stand up to this \u201cthreat\u201d then he surely deserves to be ridiculed as a chocolate fireguard. Neil BlackshawAlnwick, Northumberland I see that Labour is planning to ditch its commitment to address global heating and a sluggish economy. It seems that whenever under attack from the Tories and their friends and paymasters, Labour backs off for fear of losing votes. What exactly is Labour for? I don\u2019t want headbangers of the left any more than headbangers of the right, but what I do want is some\u00a0national leadership from Sir Keir Starmer, not just party leadership, especially for such an existential matter as climate change, never mind the cost of energy to households and businesses. I don\u2019t recall such tentativeness from Tony\u00a0Blair or Harold Wilson, for all their shortcomings.John FilbyAshover, Derbyshire Labour\u2019s retreat on green policies confirms how difficult it will be to change people\u2019s behaviour, even to protect the planet. As we saw with the minor issues surrounding the expansion of the ultra-low emission zone scheme in London, there will always be people opposed to the changes if they are affected. And in this case they were opposing policies aimed at reducing pollution to improve their own air!The Tories quite successfully opposed the plans, which encouraged more extreme people to vandalise cameras and equipment, all because a few thousand people would have to scrap their old, highly polluting bangers.So unless we can develop hard green policies with the agreement\u00a0of at least the main parties, change will not happen. And even then there will be other groups ready to fight change. David ReedLondon Do you have a photograph you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? If so, please click here to upload it.

It would essentially force planning officials to pretend sewage pollution from new developments does not exist when considering applications for sensitive areas such as the Norfolk Broads and Lake District.The current rules aim to sustain \u201cnutrient neutrality\u201d, meaning no more nutrient pollution such as nitrates and phosphates enter important habitats in sewage from new housing. These nutrients choke rivers, filling them with algae and killing the life within.The duke\u2019s amendment, which will be debated in the coming days, would \u201cdelete \u2026 the requirement placed on a local authority to assume that nutrients in wastewater would not cause harm to the environment\u201d. This would effectively undo the government\u2019s amendment and maintain the protections for rivers.Goldsmith is understood to be lobbying his fellow peers to back the duke\u2019s amendment. Other signatories include the Green party\u2019s Jenny Jones, and Kate Parminter of the Liberal Democrats.The Office for Environmental Protection, set up to replace the EU as a watchdog for environmental regulation in the UK, has said these rules are a regression in environmental standards and asked Coffey and Gove to appear in front of the House of Commons to explain themselves. Those who hoped Labour would undo this \u201cregression\u201d when in power were disappointed when the then shadow levelling up secretary, Lisa Nandy, indicated she supported the government position. It is unclear whether her replacement, Angela Rayner, does too.The Lib Dem environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, has reported the solicitor general and the prime minister to the ethics adviser for a breach of the ministerial code, claiming they have misled parliament by saying they would not degrade the environment.Farron said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s contradiction on environmental protections is not only a grave concern for the environment, but also potentially a serious breach of the ministerial code.\u201cMinisters are expected to provide accurate information. We need an urgent investigation into this to get to the bottom of whether the prime minister and solicitor general have knowingly misled the House of Commons.\u201dA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always been clear we will never compromise our high standards and we are fully committed to our ambitious and legally binding commitments on the environment. The reforms we\u2019ve set out will see us tackle pollution at source in a way that these legacy laws never addressed through a significant package to restore waterways and leave our environment in a better state than we found it.\u201cThis will see us more than offset the negligible impact of new homes on levels of nutrients, by doubling the investment for Natural England to tackle nutrients, bringing this to \u00a3280m, drawing up bespoke plans to restore nature in the most affected areas, and providing more support than ever to help farmers reduce pollution from essential agriculture.\u201d",

        "text": "One of our era\u2019s great and inconvenient truths is that global food production and the climate emergency are intimately linked. Drought, flood and other extreme weather events threaten farming ecosystems across the world. At the same time, greenhouse gas emissions from animal agriculture play a major role in global heating. We know that the default western diet, with its heavy emphasis on meat and dairy, is harming the planet. Eating habits in wealthy countries will have to change, and livestock numbers be reduced, if climate targets are to be met and vulnerable food systems saved.At the end of the month, this message will be heard front and centre in the next round of the UN climate negotiations. At Cop28 in Dubai, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization will foreground the need to transform patterns of consumption and production if the goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is to be met. The emphasis on the impact of food systems is welcome and overdue. For various reasons it has been badly neglected at previous summits.But while the science is stark and straightforward, the politics is anything but. Agriculture is a sector where economic interests overlap with cultural traditions, national identities and sentimental attachments to the land. It was telling that when Rishi Sunak was desperately searching for green policies to oppose this autumn, he chose to invent a fictional \u201cmeat tax\u201d proposal to suit his purposes. Mr Sunak was nakedly and disreputably seeking to create net zero dividing lines ahead of the next election. But across the west, more principled politicians than him are struggling to show leadership on fraught and sensitive terrain.In the United States, Joe Biden has introduced new requirements to reduce methane emissions in fossil fuel industries, but they did not extend to the vast American beef industry. Last spring, the Dutch Farmer-Citizen Movement \u2013 set up in protest at government plans to reduce livestock numbers by a third \u2013 sent shock waves across Europe when it won regional elections. In Ireland, where farming makes up almost 40% of all emissions, proposals for similarly dramatic culls have been discussed behind closed doors in government, but not approved as policy. Compared with sectors such as transport and construction, the green transition in agriculture is notably underpowered.The drift must not continue. This month, Denmark\u2019s climate minister called for EU farmers to pay for their greenhouse gas emissions through a form of trading scheme. New Zealand will price emissions from livestock farming from 2025 \u2013 the only country in the world to have committed to do so. These are moves in the right direction, but only if combined with a generous combination of subsidies, compensation and financial incentives for farmers to diversify. Similarly, persuading western populations to eat less meat will require imaginative, innovative political leadership. Any proposed \u201cmeat tax\u201d will provide automatic fodder for the populist right. But if revenue from new pricing mechanisms is directed towards the popular cause of animal welfare and some form of climate payment to the less well-off, the politics might begin to look different.Changing the way we eat is an enormous cultural challenge, with huge economic implications. It cannot be done by stealth or diktat, or on the cheap. Nor can the task be swerved if sustainable farming is to flourish in the future. Governments must follow where Cop28 leads.",

At the time of his death Dick was the most senior of the Royal Geographical Society\u2019s 16,000 fellows.His research between the 1950s and 70s on field expeditions in the Sahel, Tibesti, the Kalahari and the Ethiopian Rift established the scale of climate change on African desert margins. He and his students made cutting-edge use of air photographs to map ancient sand seas around the Sahara and the Kalahari, showing massive desert expansion at the height of the last glaciation (20,000 to 12,500 years ago). Surveys of the fossil shorelines of ancient lakes showed the \u201cgreening\u201d of the Sahara in the early Holocene (10,000 to 5,000 years ago).In the early 70s, when international attention was focused on the African Sahel by the tragedy of drought and famine, Dick\u2019s research found a new and important policy audience, challenging glib Malthusian arguments about population growth and \u201cdesertification\u201d. From the late 80s, Dick\u2019s interests expanded to the environmental history of the Mediterranean, documenting the complex interplay between environment and peoples from the earliest times to the present.Dick Grove by an ancient spit and stromatolite bed at Lake Chew Bahir, Ethiopia, in the 1970s. Photograph: Andrew GoudieDick was born in Evesham, Worcestershire, to Christine (nee Hughes), a milliner, and Edwin Grove, a fruit and vegetable grower. In 1941, after attending Prince Henry\u2019s grammar school in the market town, Dick went to St Catharine\u2019s College, Cambridge, to study geography. From 1942 to 1945 he was a pilot in the Royal Air Force, serving primarily in Air Training Command in Canada. He returned to Cambridge, finally graduating with a first-class degree in 1947.He worked briefly for the Colonial Office in Nigeria on the problem of soil erosion, before returning to Cambridge as a demonstrator in the department of geography in 1949. He was appointed to a lectureship in 1954, and remained in Cambridge for the rest of his career, retiring as lecturer in 1982, although he continued as director of the Centre of African Studies in 1986. He was elected a fellow of Downing College in 1963, eventually serving as senior tutor and vice master.Dick was a true geographer of very wide interests. He was a somewhat diffident lecturer, but a highly stimulating supervisor and a generous colleague. An acute and wry observer of landscapes and people, he had a profound influence on science and on those he worked with and taught.He married Jean Clark, a Cambridge glaciologist, in 1954, and they had six children. Jean died in 2001 and their son Richard, a pioneering environmental historian, died in 2020.

He did not give a reason for his departure and said he would be taking a break once he left the role. Judith Simon, Verra\u2019s recently appointed president, will serve as interim CEO following Antonioli\u2019s departure on 16 June.\u201cThe trust you placed in Verra and myself in my role as CEO has meant a lot, and I leave knowing we have made tremendous strides together in addressing some of the world\u2019s most vexing environmental and social problems. Working with you on these important issues has been a great highlight of my career,\u201d he said.The announcement follows a difficult period for Verra, which has seen the environmental integrity of their carbon standard satirised by the comedian John Oliver and journalistic expos\u00e9s about the integrity of their carbon credit certification process.In January, a nine-month investigation by the Guardian, the German weekly Die Zeit and the investigative group SourceMaterial found Verra rainforest credits used by Disney, Shell, Gucci and other big corporations were largely worthless, often based on stopping the destruction of rainforests that were not threatened, according to independent studies. It also found evidence of forced evictions at a flagship scheme co-operated by Conservation International in Peru.Antonioli strongly rejected the findings of the investigation and defended Verra\u2019s impact on the conservation of rainforests. The organisation is in the process of introducing new rules for generating rainforest carbon credits, with all projects set to be using the new system by mid-2025.Some firms are moving away from offsetting-based environmental claims, such as Gucci, which has removed a carbon neutrality claim from its website that heavily relied on Verra\u2019s carbon credits.Scientists have called for the unregulated system to be urgently reformed to finance climate mitigation and forest conservation despite current concerns about integrity.Diego Saez Gil, the CEO of Pachama, a carbon offsetting firm that uses AI and remote sensing to verify and monitor carbon capture by forests, said he would like Verra to update its programmes with the latest science and techniques to improve integrity.\u201cThis is a pivotal moment for carbon markets. In order to scale the critical funding required for carbon sequestration at a planetary scale, we must ensure integrity, transparency, and real benefits for local communities and biodiversity. A new generation of innovative players is collaborating with standard bodies, academics, corporates, and communities, creating a new era of carbon markets that gives me hope,\u201d he said.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

Chile has been among the worst affected countries with fires at the beginning of the year and now extended droughts. Cordero said Santiago was sweltering in its ninth heatwave since January and was expected to break the annual record of 10 heatwaves, set in 2020.Marcos Andrade, the director of atmospheric physics at the Universidad Mayor de San Andr\u00e9s in La Paz, said the Andean plateau in Bolivia and Peru had also experienced \u201cunusual\u201d weather since the start of the year.\u201cAt Puno, on the other side of Titicaca Lake, they had their driest January since records began 59 years ago.

If governments want to keep the 1.5C goal within reach while supporting energy security, doubling energy efficiency progress this decade is critical.\u201cThe findings of this report are a stark warning to the leaders gathering shortly at the Cop28 climate conference in Dubai that they all need to commit to stronger action on efficiency and to deliver on it.\u201dThe UK improved its energy efficiency by about 7% last year, according to the IEA, lagging behind neighbouring countries including the Netherlands, Ireland and France, which all reported an improvement of at least 12%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yet, there is an answer. It\u2019s nearly 10 years since Jonathan Porritt, in his book The World We Made, first called for the kind of carbon tax (now known more generally as climate income) that\u2019s been implemented in four provinces of Canada. It\u2019s basically a\u00a0predictably rising price on all fossil fuels, with the funds rebated\u00a0to citizens.The policy is redistributive, costs the government nothing and, unlike a one-off windfall tax, holds the promise of gradually pricing fossil fuels entirely out of the market. Meanwhile, it rewards alternative energy use and gives incentives to every kind of \u201cgreen\u201d innovation, initiative or behaviour.Studies show that this policy on its own could be a giant step to net zero, cutting pollution and climate costs, and paid for by fossil fuel companies themselves. Judy Hindley Co-founder, Citizens\u2019 Climate\u00a0Lobby\u00a0UK Reading how the wealthiest tiny minority are responsible for huge impacts on global warming makes me wonder, why bother? The wealthiest 10% can afford to adopt any lifestyle and so have total control over whether, and how much, to pollute. And your research shows that they appear to choose to pollute as much\u00a0as\u00a0possible.Private jets, yachts, multiple large homes, gas-guzzling cars ... the list goes on. Add in the water companies discharging raw sewage into rivers, lakes and seas, and the environmental horror is complete. In the meantime, we\u2019re encouraged to switch off lights, recycle the odd plastic bottle, compost bits of food waste and reuse our shopping bags.It\u2019s so disheartening to realise that a lifetime of effort by households to reduce and recycle waste, save energy and reduce pollution will be wiped out in a matter of days by the world\u2019s richest people just carrying on as\u00a0usual. Why bother?Adrian WardLe Bez, France Re Jonathan Watts\u2019 article (Indigenous solutions to the carbon divide, 22 November), I believe that the harnessing of Indigenous knowledge is an opportunity to learn from the colonial mistakes of the past. Rather than export our ideas on climate change, we must consider what we can gain from the lived experiences of Indigenous communities such as the Baniwa people in the Brazilian Amazon. Deforestation in South America has a detrimental impact on the climate, and through the destruction of these lands we could also be destroying potential solutions provided by the people\u00a0who call it home. Matilda Michael-PhillipsNewcastle upon Tyne There are two separate issues at stake. One is inequality, which is grotesque, intolerable and has to be righted. The other is carbon emissions, which in principle can be cut independently and even in advance of progress on equality.

And even small greening actions in cities can significantly improve local biodiversity, new research suggests.Increasing the diversity of native plants in a single urban green space resulted in a sevenfold increase in the number of insect species after three years, Australian researchers have found.According to the study\u2019s authors, there had previously been \u201clittle empirical evidence of how specific greening actions may mitigate the detrimental effects of urbanisation\u201d.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nExisting research largely involved observational studies where urban greening had already taken place and \u201cscientists come after the fact to see what\u2019s happened\u201d, said the study\u2019s lead author, Dr Luis Mata of the University of Melbourne and a lead research scientist at Cesar Australia.The greening initiative was conducted on a small 195 sq m plot of land in Melbourne, on a site adjacent to a major road.\u201cIt was conducted in a very densely urbanised area, completely surrounded by streets and relatively tall buildings, and with limited access to surrounding green space,\u201d Mata said.Even so, the team found \u201csubstantial ecological changes\u201d, he said. \u201cI think we found a really strong signal given the disadvantages of the site itself.\u201dResearchers measured baseline insect numbers the year before greening began, when 12 indigenous plant species were introduced to the space, and subsequently conducted insect surveys for the following three years.They identified 94 insect species in total, 91 indigenous to the Australian state of Victoria. The researchers estimated that by the final year of the study there were about 7.3 times more insect species than originally present, even though only nine plant species remained.The team also found substantial increases in the number of predator and parasitoid insect species, which help to regulate populations of pest insects.\u201cThese are two key groups that provide a really good ecological signal that the trophic network and all the proper interactions are happening at the site,\u201d Mata said.Prescribing nature: the restorative power of a simple dose of outdoorsRead moreThe researchers concluded that the study contributed a \u201ccritical evidence base to support future greening projects and the practice, policy and decision-making for protecting nature in urban environments\u201d.\u201cI think we\u2019re starting to see some good greening outcomes that are being captured in policy, at least in principle,\u201d Mata said. \u201cProviding the evidence that greening is actually working is critical.\u201dHe hopes the study may motivate gardeners who are encouraged to plant native plants. \u201cThis could help provide the evidence that \u2026 no matter how small your intervention, you\u2019re going to derive a good positive ecological outcome.\u201d\u201cWe really need to do a better job valuing small, isolated green spaces,\u201d said Prof Dieter Hochuli of the University of Sydney, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe size of the area being studied is what many would typically claim doesn\u2019t really serve as great habitat for things, and isn\u2019t contributing much to biodiversity and its management. The data in this paper show otherwise.\u201cIt\u2019s also a potent reminder of the importance [of] consider[ing] the quality of habitat, not just the amount of it.

Since 2019, 25 of these eagles, which are Britain\u2019s biggest bird of prey, have been released to the Isle of Wight as part of an effort to bring back long-lost species.The male chick is the first offspring from that initial release. He is 12 weeks old and left the nest last week, although he will stay close to home and be fed by his parents for the next few months. The location of the nest has not been revealed to prevent disturbance.Steve Egerton-Read, a project officer for Forestry England, spotted the chick through his binoculars while standing in a neighbouring field. \u201cWe were utterly elated and gobsmacked,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve known there was a nest there for a long time and I still don\u2019t quite believe it\u2019s happened.\u201dWhite-tailed eagles, which have a wingspan of 2.4 metres (8ft), usually do not start breeding until they are four or five years old, and this pair are only three. They are the first to breed out of three pairs that have established territories in southern England.A white-tailed eagle after catching a fish. Photograph: Yonhap/EPAThe release is licensed by Natural England, the government\u2019s wildlife agency. It follows a successful reintroduction programme in the Scottish Highlands, where white-tailed eagles started to be released in the 1970s after chicks were taken from Norway. There are now more than 150 pairs in Scotland.The reintroduction programme, led by Forestry England and the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation, involved moving birds south. The female of the pair was originally from the Outer Hebrides and the male from north-west Sutherland. More releases are planned this summer on the Isle of Wight.The birds are often called sea eagles because a huge part of their diet is fish. The Isle of Wight was chosen because the Solent offers plenty of food, as well as an abundance of cliffs and woodlands, providing potential nesting and resting sites. The birds have been spotted widely in England, from Cornwall to the Norfolk coast, and have even made forays across the Channel.The chick has been ringed and fitted with a GPS tag so ornithologists can track its progress.Roy Dennis, the founder of the eponymous wildlife foundation, described the development as a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d. He said: \u201cThis is a very special moment for everyone who has worked on, supported and followed this groundbreaking project. Restoring a breeding population in southern England, where the species was once widespread, has been our ultimate goal. Many thought it was impossible but we knew food for eagles \u2013 fresh- and saltwater fish, cuttlefish, rabbits, hares and wild birds \u2013 was plentiful.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It is clear that the Conservatives\u2019 obsession with London\u2019s Ulez has nothing to do with the merits or demerits of the scheme and everything to do with their desperate attempts to cling to power by trying to weaponise green issues. Ulez was originally conceived by a Tory mayor, and is similar to other clean air zones being rolled out across the country with backing from the government. It is based on rock-solid science that is widely accepted both around the world and here at home. The government\u2019s own figures, for example, show that air pollution is causing between 28,000 and 36,000 early deaths nationwide every year. About 4,000 of these premature deaths are in London.The Conservatives have overseen 13 years of decline \u2013 with soaring rents and mortgages, devastated public services, sky-high bills and the highest tax burden on working people in a generation.

Some are now using artificial intelligence to detect vapes and their lithium-ion batteries, as well as installing thermal imaging cameras and automatic foam jets.The hazardous material dealt with at waste and recycling plants means they can potentially cause fires similar to 2020\u2019s Bradford tyre fire which burned for a week and forced 20 schools to close and required every firefighter in West Yorkshire.Around 1.3m single-use vapes are now thrown away each week in the UK \u2013 an extraordinary rise since the first was sold in 2019 \u2013 and many are dumped by the roadside or in general waste. They contain lithium-ion batteries, which easily catch fire if broken, and some vapers have suffered life-changing injuries after theirs have exploded.Research by Material Focus, a non-profit organisation which runs the Recycle Your Electricals campaign, found that more than 700 fires in bin lorries and recycling centres were caused by batteries that had been dumped into general waste.Grundon, which recycles around 80,000 tonnes of household and municipal waste a year, has seen an increase in the number of disposable vapes being picked up by road sweeping vehicles, whose circular brushes usually collect leaves and stones.\u201cThey\u2019re sold as disposable so people just throw them on the floor,\u201d said Owen George, division manager for Grundon. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see any about a year or so ago, but now they\u2019re everywhere. We probably pick out 100 to 150 on an eight-hour shift. And they\u2019re just the ones we catch.\u201dThe ones they don\u2019t catch can end up in their non-recyclable waste stream with items such as Pringles cans, plastic wrappers and disposable coffee cups. These are chopped and packed into bales, a process that can break open a lithium-ion battery, which can then easily catch fire. Grundon has had three or four fires in the past year alone at just one site.Some disposable vapes at Grundon waste management recyling plant in Slough. Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer\u201cWe\u2019ve managed to put them out, but the frequency is really growing,\u201d George said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just us \u2013 it\u2019s affecting everyone in the industry.\u201dGrundon has installed fire detection equipment costing about \u00a3250,000 at each of its facilities. \u201cWe\u2019ve put in thermal-imaging cameras and, in some places, we\u2019ve got automated cannons that lock on to the fire and hit it with water and foam to put it out.\u201dInsurers have become reluctant to cover the waste industry because of the fire risk, with premiums growing and expensive fire safety systems now a requirement. Artificial intelligence is another option.About 70% of the recycling facilities market in Europe is operated by companies who now use AI developed by Greyparrot.\u201cWe have a box that has a camera inside and we take continuous images of the waste stream, then use AI to detect and analyse those images,\u201d said Mikela Druckman, Greyparrot\u2019s chief executive.I tried to properly recycle a disposable vape. It did not go well | Emma SnaithRead moreThe system can recognise 67 types of material which can then be sorted \u2013 iron and steel can be picked up magnetically, while lighter PET plastic bottles can be blown off with a burst of air.\u201cWe\u2019re doing several projects, mainly in Austria but now also in the UK, where we\u2019re identifying batteries in the waste stream,\u201d Druckman said.Justin Guest, co-founder of Archipelago Eco, which invests in recycling technology, said that banning vapes would be \u201ca blunt instrument\u201d, adding: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve the problem because it\u2019s not just vapes \u2013 there are batteries in so many things now. People will always get stuff and throw it away.\u201cThere will be some other consumer craze that comes along and these materials will always find their way into the waste stream. So you need safeguards, and you need technology to solve that problem.\u201dAbout 138m single-use vapes are now sold in the UK each year, containing enough lithium for about 1,200 electric vehicle batteries.

I understand why he\u2019s prioritising climate over economic issues (though the two are of course deeply interrelated). This is indeed a highly important election. Its outcome will contribute significantly to whether humans, and many other species, will survive beyond the next few decades. Politics doesn\u2019t get any more epic than that.However, Vince doesn\u2019t apply the same logic in his statement that \u201ca vote for anyone other than Labour, or no vote at all, is a vote for another Tory government\u201d. Such a suggestion is worse than incorrect, it\u2019s dangerously counterproductive. A Labour vote in constituencies where another progressive candidate has the most support will help the Conservative candidate win.Vince might do well to look at what South Devon Primary group is doing: engaging in a process to ensure the most popular progressive candidate is identified to reduce the risk of wasted votes and ensure the incumbent Tory loses their seat. The more constituencies that adopt a similar approach, the fewer seats the Tories will win. Fund the Labour party if you like, Dale, but South Devon Primary\u2019s intelligent, pragmatic and democratic approach is more worthy, and needing, of your unequivocal endorsement.Gill CoombsMelksham, Wiltshire I am delighted to hear that Dale Vince is withdrawing support from Just Stop Oil. As a rational person I am in 100% agreement with the group\u2019s aims, but its methods are actively counterproductive. You win an argument by making friends, not with aggression. And contrary to its claims, I would say that kettling people indiscriminately in their cars on a motorway, for example, is not a peaceful act.Mr Vince now realises what was always true: antagonising random members of the public is not going to change any government policy, but will make people angry and, for some, that anger will be directed against your aims as well as your movement. A voting drive to get Labour into power on a green mandate is a more positive strategy, and I wish him every success.Jake PrimeDartford, Kent I wholeheartedly agree with Dale Vince\u2019s decision to concentrate his efforts on supporting Labour to end this destructive period of Conservative rule. I still count myself as a climate campaigner and activist, but unfortunately protest, especially by Just Stop Oil, has got us nowhere. In fact, it has sadly fuelled the Tories\u2019 narrative of irresponsible anti-British \u201cwoke\u201d people (us) and responsible, patriotic, upright citizens (them). The Just Vote campaign is definitely the way ahead for a constructive vital future free of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d.Emily ThwaiteRedmarley, Gloucestershire Can I be the 94th person to point out Dale Vince\u2019s political naivety? To state \u201cLabour is green\u201d is seriously wishful thinking, and in some constituencies like ours, a vote for Labour would mean the Tories would definitely get in.

A staple of traditional Chinese medicine, the lion\u2019s mane is also native to the UK, but is under threat. The \u201cabsolutely enormous\u201d specimen spotted by Jephson was the first to be seen in south-west England in eight years.Little did he know then that the fungus would change the focus of Jephson\u2019s work. He is now working with Natural England and the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) to get native mushrooms back into England\u2019s woodlands. He helps run a mushroom farm, which has pivoted from growing oyster and shiitake mushrooms for restaurants, to conserving native fungi and creating health supplements from them.Lion\u2019s mane is so rare that it is illegal to collect it from the wild, and it must be left undisturbed. Jephson was happy to admire it on his walks around the farm where he found it, pleased it was thriving in the wild.So he was shocked one day to see the landowner had felled its host tree. Speaking at the Oxford Real Farming Conference, he said: \u201cThe mushroom was smashed all over the ground in big soggy pieces. And so finding ourselves in a slightly unique situation because they\u2019re illegal to collect, we picked up a solid lump of lion\u2019s mane and took it back to the mushroom farm and started trying to get a clean culture of it.\u201dJephson has cloned the mushroom and is keeping its culture going at the farm. He also spoke to the landowner, who was unaware of the rare nature of the fungus, and he has left the tree stump alone, with lion\u2019s mane still growing on it.This led the fungarium down the path of keeping native mushrooms alive. \u201cIt was finding the lion\u2019s mane that really got us down that path of cloning rare mushrooms. And now people have been approaching us wanting natural strains.\u201cNatural England and RHS Wisley [have] slightly different projects, and are using our strains to experiment. Wisley are interested in the insects that feed on mushrooms, so have been growing our strains at their site on logs in their garden to monitor the insects which come.\u201cNatural England have several strains of native mushrooms that they want to be putting into woodland. They want to track how spores are travelling through woodland, but also to encourage deep rot fungus. So certainly mushrooms break down different parts of the trees, and we want, in order to encourage biodiversity, to have mushrooms that are good at breaking down.\u201dRare fungi are not just at risk from unwitting landowners and their axes \u2013 there are fears that spores from commercial farms could be spreading into the wild and affecting native mushrooms.\u201cMushroom farming is getting more and more popular, which is great,\u201d Jephson said, \u201cbut all these commercial strains coming in, all these spores being put out in the environment, we just don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing to local ecology.\u201cI was talking to someone at a truffle festival a few months ago, and they were saying they found yellow oyster mushrooms. And they started in the summer growing on a hay bale. And yellow oysters are an exotic species. They are just not endemic, it was in the middle of nowhere.\u201cShe didn\u2019t know if there was a mushroom farm nearby, but I bet there was one somewhere around there, or even a grow kit that someone had been growing in a windowsill, and these yellow oyster spores found their way out into the environment, on to a hay bale.\u201dNative, wild mushrooms could be better for people\u2019s health than commercial strains, Jephson said: \u201cThe commercial strains have been selected for high yield, fast growth. Our mushrooms are the opposite. They\u2019re growing in ugly lumps. They grow incredibly slowly. They\u2019re really picky about conditions. But they taste amazing, and our UK strain of lion\u2019s mane has been tested for medicinal compounds in it, and the wild clone has 30% more beta glucans than the commercial strains.\u201d",

Tests on the animals show that the cats\u2019 genetic diversity is so low they will become locally extinct within the next 30 years unless there is urgent intervention.Historically lynxes have ranged across the expanse of Eurasia, but the elusive animals have come under intense pressure in many countries from habitat loss, inbreeding, poaching, and traffic collisions.In the 18th century, lynxes vanished from France entirely. After a re-introduction project in Switzerland in the 1970s some Eurasian lynxes moved across the border to France and re-established themselves in the Jura mountains. But the population failed to reach sufficient numbers to make it stable.Rewilding: should we bring the lynx back to Britain?Read moreScientists at the Centre Athenas, a wildlife protection centre in eastern France, collected 88 DNA samples from injured, dead, or orphaned lynxes between 2008 and 2020 and were able to analyse 78 to form a picture of the population\u2019s genetic health. To avoid distress to the animals the team did not obtain samples from healthy wild lynxes.The tests revealed an alarming lack of genetic diversity. Although researchers believe there are more than 120 adult lynxes in France, the population has a level of diversity equivalent to only 38 animals. \u201cThis population has lost a lot of genetic diversity since it was reintroduced in Switzerland,\u201d said Nathen Huvier, an author on the study. \u201cIf no new genetic material is reintroduced this population will go extinct, once again, in less than 30 years.\u201dWriting in Frontiers in Conservation Science the researchers describe how the DNA from the lynxes reveals a devastating level of inbreeding, with two mating cats now extremely likely to be closely related.\u201cA lack of genetic diversity can reduce the fitness of the individuals, generate diseases and reduce the ability of the individuals to adapt to environmental changes,\u201d Huvier said. A population that presented those characteristics \u201cwas not able to evolve\u201d so was vulnerable to collapse, he added.As an apex predator the lynx was a keystone species in the local ecosystem, Huvier said. One way to bolster the population\u2019s genetic diversity was to introduce more lynxes from healthier groups, such as those in Switzerland or Germany. But such introduction projects were politically difficult, Huvier said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Increasing the level of tree cover from the European average of 14.9% to 30% can lower the temperature in cities by 0.4C, which could reduce heat-related deaths by 39.5%, according to first-of-its-kind modelling of 93 European cities by an international team of researchers.The lead author, Tamara Iungman, from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, said: \u201cThis is becoming increasingly urgent as Europe experiences more extreme temperature fluctuations caused by climate change.\u201cWe already know that high temperatures in urban environments are associated with negative health outcomes, such as cardiorespiratory failure, hospital admission, and premature death.\u201d Her team wants to influence policymakers to make cities greener, \u201cmore sustainable, resilient and healthy\u201d as well as mitigating climate breakdown, she added, since heat-related illness and death are expected to present an even bigger burden to health services over the next decade than cold temperatures.The researchers used mortality data to estimate the potential reduction in deaths from lower temperatures as a result of increased tree coverage. Using data from 2015 they estimated that out of the 6,700 premature deaths that year attributed to higher urban temperatures, 2,644 could have been prevented had tree cover been increased.The cities most likely to benefit from the increase in tree coverage are in south and eastern Europe, where summer temperatures are highest and tree coverage tends to be lower.In Cluj-Napoca in Romania \u2013 which had the highest number of premature deaths due to heat in 2015, at 32 per 100,000 people \u2013 tree coverage is just 7%. In Lisbon, Portugal it is as low as 3.6% and in Barcelona its 8.4%. That compares with 15.5% in London and 34% in Oslo. Study co-author Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, a researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, said the team picked 30% as that is a target that many cities are currently working towards. He said there was no need for buildings to be razed and replaced with parks, since there is enough space to plant more trees in all the cities the team looked at. He praised initiatives such as the EU\u2019s 3bn trees plan, and the UK government\u2019s proposal to ensure every home is within a 15-minute walk from green space, though he noted that policymakers must ensure trees are evenly distributed between richer and poor neighbourhoods.He added that cities which are \u201ctoo car-dominated\u201d should consider replacing asphalt roads, which absorb heat, with trees. Planting more trees in cities should be prioritised because it brings a huge range of health benefits beyond reducing heat-related deaths, he added, including reducing cardiovascular disease, dementia and poor mental health.Prof Yadvinder Malhi, professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study, said:\u201cMore than half of the world\u2019s people live in towns and cities, so trees are going to be critical in making urban areas resilient to climate change and improve urban environments. Urban trees bring many co-benefits beyond climate change adaptation: many studies show just seeing and smelling trees benefit health and wellbeing, as well as enhancing urban biodiversity. But most tree cover is found in wealthy towns and neighbourhoods, so enhancing urban tree cover can reduce this inequity and particularly reduce the high vulnerability of poorer neighbourhoods to climate change.\u201d",

Now we know Madagascar has a different species,\u201d says Weigmann.It\u2019s important just to give the species a name, to bring attention to itSimon WeigmannThe name he picked for the scientific literature is Pliotrema kajae \u2013 Kaja\u2019s sixgill sawshark \u2013 after his young daughter who watched on with great interest while he examined the preserved shark specimens at home. Kaja also means warrior in Frisian, a west-Germanic language, which Weigmann thought was appropriate given sharks\u2019 weapon-like snouts.A specimen of a third species of sixgill sawshark came to Weigmann after colleagues visited a fish market on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar. He named this one P annae, after Kaya\u2019s cousin Anna.Something that sets these species apart from previously known sawsharks is that their moustaches (technically known as barbels) lie closer to the tip of their snouts, but Weigmann doesn\u2019t yet know the relevance of this.Discovered in the deep: the squid that makes a decoy out of its own skinRead moreSimilarly, there\u2019s no obvious explanation for why these sawsharks have six gill slits. Out of the more than 1,000 species of sharks and rays, only a handful have six or seven gill slits.Radiographs of the heads of three Pliotrema species.

The original species, P warreni, lives off South Africa and southern Mozambique, down to about 900 metres. Kajas have been found between 200 and 300 metres underwater off Madagascar and on the submarine Mascarene plateau that stretches between Seychelles and Mauritius. Annas have so far only been found off Zanzibar, in much shallower waters of between 20 and 35 metres.\u201cIt\u2019s important to give the species a name, to bring attention to it,\u201d says Weigmann.

Photograph: Royal Zoological Society of Scotland/PAThese eggs hatched into caterpillars and then pupated into adults, producing a further 497 eggs. From these, 160 caterpillars were released into the wild.The first moths from these caterpillars were found in light traps by conservation scientists monitoring the site.Dr Tom Prescott, the head of conservation for Butterfly Conservation Scotland, said: \u201cI was peering in the moth trap and I could see one on an egg carton in the trap. I couldn\u2019t quite believe my eyes \u2013 it was very exciting.\u201cWe hope this is just the start of the moth becoming established at this site \u2013 it shows that the habitat is correct, and we hope the population will thrive and become sustainable there.\u201dConservation scientists want to spot some female moths at the site during the species\u2019 short flight season of a couple of weeks but the RZSS said \u201cpainstaking\u201d captive breeding would continue for some years.Breeding moths will be carefully paired and managed to maintain their genetic diversity while conservationists also work with landowners to create other suitable sites with lots of young aspen shoots for further releases and to encourage the species \u2013 not thought to be particularly mobile \u2013 to naturally spread.Dr Helen Taylor, the conservation programme manager at RZSS, said: \u201cThis is a really important and exciting step in our efforts to save dark bordered beauty moths, but there\u2019s still a long way to go.\u201cWe have made a long-term commitment to help improve the conservation status of dark bordered beauty moths and ideally we would like to see successfully reintroduced, self-sustaining populations at multiple sites to safeguard the future of this stunning, but little-known moth. That\u2019s going to take a few years, but this is a brilliant start.\u201dThe moth is one of a number of endangered invertebrates found in the Cairngorms that conservationists are seeking to revive, including the silver stiletto fly, the pine hoverfly and the small scabious mining bee.Taylor said: \u201cAll insects play vital roles in the ecosystems they live in, from pollination to waste recycling. Without these often overlook animals, ecosystems start to fall apart. Working with big, fluffy, charismatic animals is also important, but if we want healthy ecosystems to release animals like beavers and wildcats into, then we need to look after little guys like dark bordered beauty as well. I\u2019m really glad that at RZSS we are working at both ends of that scale.\u201d This article was amended on 26 July 2023 to clarify that the people in the second photograph are from the dark bordered beauty steering group.",

        "text": "The world is likely to face major disruption to food supplies well before temperatures rise by the 1.5C target, the president of the UN\u2019s desertification conference has warned, as the impacts of the climate crisis combine with water scarcity and poor farming practices to threaten global agriculture.Alain-Richard Donwahi, a former Ivory Coast defence minister who led last year\u2019s UN Cop15 summit on desertification, said the effects of drought were taking hold more rapidly than expected.\u201cClimate change is a pandemic that we need to fight quickly. See how fast the degradation of the climate is going \u2013 I think it\u2019s going even faster than we predicted,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is fixated on 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels], and it\u2019s a very important target. But actually, some very bad things could happen, in terms of soil degradation, water scarcity and desertification, way before 1.5C.\u201dThe problems of rising temperatures, heatwaves and more intense droughts and floods, were endangering food security in many regions, Donwahi said. \u201c[Look at] the effects of droughts on food security, the effects of droughts on migration of population, the effect of droughts on inflation. We could have an acceleration of negative effects, other than temperature,\u201d he said.Poor farming practices were not helping, he said. \u201cThe degradation of soil comes with bad habits, and the way we do our agriculture will lead to degradation of the soil. When the soil is affected, the yield is affected,\u201d he said.Donwahi called on private sector investors to get involved and take advantage of opportunities for turning a profit. \u201cThe private sector has an interest in agriculture, and the better usage of the soil. We\u2019re talking about [improving] yields. We\u2019re talking about agroforestry, which is another way the private sector can have a return on investment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be innovative, to find new vehicles for finance.\u201dGovernments around the world signed a treaty pledging to combat desertification in 1992, alongside the UN framework convention on climate change, which is the parent treaty to the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and the UN convention on biodiversity, which aims to safeguard species abundance.But the desertification treaty gains least attention, and last year\u2019s Cop15 on desertification went largely unnoticed compared with the climate Cop27 and the biodiversity Cop15 last December. Desertification Cops are held less frequently than climate summits: the next desertification conference will be held in Riyadh in December 2024, while the next climate summit, Cop28, will be in Dubai in late November.Donwahi said the world could not afford to ignore desertification. \u201cWe need to solve all the problems together. Desertification and drought leads to climate change, leads to loss of biodiversity. And when you have climate change you have droughts, floods, storms.\u201cIt\u2019s not only the poor countries, everybody is in the same boat [on food security]. Climate change, droughts, storms, floods don\u2019t know any boundaries, they don\u2019t need a visa to go into a country.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It\u2019s good for our wellbeing, our pride of place, for climate resilience and of course for nature\u2019s recovery. Yet far too many people are deprived of its benefits. That\u2019s why the trust is working with partners to invest in urban green space, and calling on others, including the government, to do the same.\u201dThe London Blossom Garden at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Stratford, east London.

Founding the charity in 1895, she said she believed that \u201cthe healthy gift of air and the joy of plants and flowers\u201d were vital in everyone\u2019s life.Ann-Marie Powell, the garden\u2019s designer, said: \u201cIn honour of Octavia Hill, we\u2019ve created a place to sit in, a place to play in, a place to stroll in and a place to spend the day in. It is a place of refuge, a place to withdraw from personal challenges and the everyday. In this space, surrounded by wildlife, your spirit can be nurtured and revived.\u201cThe garden also shows that the parks, verges and gardens of our cities and towns present a huge opportunity to increase plant diversity and provide habitats and food for wildlife, including pollinators. Many people think of biodiversity as a luxury \u2013 a nice-to-have \u2013 but it\u2019s the engine that produces everything that we consume. When it is diminished, everything loses out.\u201dThe garden is laid out as a series of \u201coutdoor sitting rooms\u201d \u2013 a core idea from Hill \u2013 where each individual garden compartment has its own atmosphere. It will feature reclaimed brick, timber, stone and thatch, sourced from National Trust places. All plants are peat-free and are climate-change resilient, including the trees. It is an urban community wildlife garden set in a brownfield site, which Powell hopes can be emulated by garden designers across the country for the public realm.The National Trust \u2018sky park\u2019 at Castlefield Viaduct in Manchester. Photograph: Annapurna Mellor/National Trust ImagesAndy Jasper, the National Trust\u2019s director of gardens and parklands, said: \u201cWhat we wanted to do was ask: if Octavia Hill was alive today, what would concern her? Without a doubt, she\u2019d want to provide access to nature for urban communities, because we believe gardens and green space have the power to transform lives in so many ways.\u201cWe hope everyone will come away from this garden with an appreciation of Octavia Hill, what she stood for and how important she has been to the formation of the National Trust. We remain inspired by the role she played and we believe that gardens can continue to address the biodiversity crisis.\u201dThe trust said Hill\u2019s mission remained relevant today, as its research showed one in three people in Britain still did not have access to nearby nature-rich spaces. While celebrating Hill\u2019s legacy, the garden also aims to inspire people to create innovative gardens that connect people with the beauty and complexity of the natural world.",

MEPs questioning executives from the companies said their actions had been \u201coutrageous\u201d and represented a \u201cscandal\u201d. The companies rejected the accusations and said they had provided all relevant studies.The withholding of nine brain toxicity studies from European regulators over the last 20 years was revealed by the Guardian in June, reporting findings from Swedish academics. They discovered that these toxicity studies had been submitted to the US pesticide regulator but not to the EU authorities.\u201cThese studies are performed in order to protect our children and grandchildren from effects on brain development,\u201d said Dr Axel Mie, of Stockholm University, who led the research.He told a special hearing in the European parliament on Tuesday: \u201cIf a company decides by themselves which studies to disclose and which ones to withhold, it is obvious that the decisions by the [regulatory] authorities become unreliable.\u201d He said risk management decisions had been delayed by 18 years in one case.Officials from the European Commission, the European Food Standards Agency (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), all of which have a role in pesticide regulation, thanked Mie and his colleague Prof Christina Rud\u00e9n for their \u201cimportant\u201d and \u201cvaluable\u201d work.\u201cWe considered [the withholding of the studies] a breach of the legal obligations of those companies and a matter of very serious concern,\u201d said Claire Bury, the commission\u2019s deputy director-general for health and food safety.\u201cAll studies are essential to have available to the regulator, irrespective of the outcome of them,\u201d said Sharon McGuinness at ECHA. \u201cIt helps us make a robust assessment and ultimately protects citizens and the environment.\u201dBernhard Url, at EFSA, called the companies\u2019 behaviour \u201cunethical\u201d and said: \u201cIndustry judges the relevance [of the toxicity studies] in a way that we would most likely not agree with.\u201dMEPs were scathing about the companies. The Swedish MEP Emma Wiesner, a member of the European parliament\u2019s committee on the environment, public health and food safety, said: \u201cThe behaviour found in this study is really unacceptable. More than a quarter of the studies [sent to US authorities] were not sent into the European agencies \u2013 that is outrageous.\u201dThe Lithuanian MEP Juozas Olekas said the companies had caused themselves \u201creputational damage\u201d, while Martin H\u00e4usling, a German MEP and member of the agriculture committee, said: \u201cThis is a right old scandal. These [are] clear breaches of existing law and previous law. And yet there are no consequences.\u201dThe power to impose penalties on companies for breaching regulatory requirements lies with individual member states of the EU, and not with the commission, unlike in cases of breaches of competition law and data protection for example. However, no country is known to have ever imposed such a penalty.Ruden said: \u201cWe were not able to identify any legal risks that the company runs when withholding a toxicity study from EU authorities. Companies are allowed to make money at the expense of public health protection.\u201dDr Cristina Alija, from Bayer, told the hearing: \u201cBayer has always acted responsibly and transparently to provide the required data for a complete safety assessment of our substances. We have to submit all relevant data and this is what we did.\u201dDr Alexandra Brand, from Syngenta, said: \u201cWe did not submit [the toxicity studies] at the time to EU regulators because they were not mandatory. We determined they did not provide any new information. Our company complies with the rules. We have nothing to hide.\u201dNew rules came into force in 2021 requiring any new pesticide study by a company to be reported to the EU when it is commissioned. However, Mie said this did not solve the problem of studies withheld in the past for pesticides still in use.What difference the withheld studies would have made to regulations if disclosed at the start of the process is disputed. Mie said it was plausible in some cases that lower pesticide exposure limits could have been imposed years earlier. Bury said none would have been a \u201cdecisive factor\u201d in regulatory decisions and the companies said they would have had no effect.Mie said his research could point to far wider withholding of toxicity studies on thousands of chemicals. \u201cWe have looked at a tiny fraction of all available pesticide toxicity studies, which in turn are only a small fraction of all toxicity studies. We have no reason to believe that the problem that we have identified is restricted to that tiny fraction,\u201d he said.",

Another 56 suspected heat deaths are still under investigation.A very American death: how Caleb Blair lost his life in the Phoenix heatRead moreAt least 45% of people who died were unsheltered and sleeping behind dumpsters, in car parks or on the burning hot sidewalk \u2013 even as daily temperatures hit 115F (46C) or higher on 22 different days. Heat deaths are always preventable given the right resources, according to public health experts.The annual heat death toll has risen threefold since 2019, as the city\u2019s affordable housing and addiction crises have converged with the climate emergency. Almost 1,900 people have died in the past five years, and thousands more have needed emergency medical help.Phoenix, the capital of Arizona and America\u2019s fifth-largest city with 1.6 million people, is accustomed to a hot desert climate, but temperatures are rising due to global heating \u2013 made worse by decades of unchecked urban development that created a sprawling heat island.In 2021, the city created a dedicated extreme heat office to tackle the rising death toll and make the stifling urban landscape more livable by increasing tree cover and built shade \u2013 especially in low-income neighborhoods which are often the least green and the hottest.In early August, the Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, declared a statewide heat emergency after an unprecedented hot spell with 31 consecutive days at 100F or higher in Phoenix. The previous record was 18 consecutive days, recorded in 1974, according to the National Weather Service (NWS) in Phoenix.The goal of the emergency declaration is to develop a coordinated response to tackle heat inequities across the state, but experts say that this will take time.\u201cSeniors, who are more vulnerable to extreme heat, are being displaced through increased housing costs at a rate faster than government agencies can find shelter for them.

According to research published earlier this year, the average person eats at least 50,000 particles of microplastic annually and breathes in a similar quantity.The great British tea test: which part of the country brings us the very best brew?Read moreThe researchers tested four different types of plastic commercial teabags from shops and caf\u00e9s in Montreal, which were cut open, washed and then steeped in near-boiling water for five minutes before being analysed by electron microscopes and spectroscopy.They found that a single bag released more than 11.6bn microplastics, which was \u201cseveral orders of magnitude higher than plastic loads previously reported in other foods\u201d, according to the study, which was published in the journal of Environmental Science and Technology.Most teabags are made from natural fibres, though many brands that use natural fibres still contain plastic to seal the bags. Some brands have moved away from paper teabags towards plastic bags, and it was these plastic bags that the researchers examined.Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic, which the researchers defined as ranging from 100nm to 5mm in size, which are mostly created by the disintegration of plastic litter. Researchers have found microplastics in the air, soil, rivers and the deepest oceans around the world, as well as in tap and bottled water, seafood and beer. Microplastics were also found in human stool samples for the first time in October.The Canadian team tested the potential toxicity of the microparticles released from the teabags by exposing water fleas to the contaminated water, finding the particles had behavioural effects and developmental malformations on the fleas.There is no evidence so far that the ingestion of microplastics poses a risk to humans, according the World Health Organisation. But, the United Nations body said more research was needed to fully understand how plastic spreads into the environment and works its way through human bodies.Researchers speculated that the reason for the high number of particles being shed by the teabags could be due to the fact that the plastic packaging had been in contact with boiling water, as even \u201cfood-grade\u201d plastics may degrade or leach toxic substances when heated above 40C.",

She won\u2019t be the only one glad. With her previous books, The Salt Path and The Wild Silence, having sold more than a million copies, Winn\u2019s fans are legion and they won\u2019t be disappointed by Landlines. Its pages offer the same potent blend of big themes (the climate crisis, extinction, migration, food security, homelessness, terminal illness, friendship) illuminated by intimate details, small observations, and a sort of magic as simple and complex as love itself. I\u2019ve never met Ray or Moth, but it\u2019s hard not to feel I\u2019d know them at a glance, even from a great distance, by the comfortable glow of their old and intricate partnership, fray-edged and worn to exquisite imperfection.The story of Landlines is another leap of faith, another long walk. Some things have changed: Ray and Moth no longer pass unrecognised, they are no longer homeless, they no longer have to survive on the most meagre of trail rations, but the shadow of Moth\u2019s illness \u2013 a condition known as corticobasal degeneration \u2013 has not gone away. In fact, it has encroached further, as the doctors said it would, albeit more slowly than anyone expected.

There are other avian totems too. Perhaps the most poignant is the golden plover, which manifests for weeks as a mysterious call in the dark.

That will not be the case next week, when environmental campaigners will watch through their fingers as one of the most consequential decisions so far is made in relation to the EU\u2019s net zero targets.Before heading for their summer holidays, MEPs are expected to vote on a proposed nature restoration law, committing European governments to rehabilitate and rewild swathes of territory suffering from desertification, deforestation and the draining of peatlands. Along with action on pesticides, this is essentially the biodiversity strand to the EU\u2019s green deal. The law\u2019s role in facilitating carbon capture and creating healthy, resilient ecosystems is deemed indispensable by scientists, if emissions reduction targets are to be met. But as with other aspects of the green transition, Europe\u2019s increasingly dominant right is now mounting a sustained campaign to derail it.In the context of post-Ukraine economic pressures and priorities, the European People\u2019s party (EPP) \u2013 which groups together centre-right parties \u2013 is arguing for a pause in environmental legislation. To that end, the EPP has allied with the climate-sceptic far right in Brussels, and is set to oppose the restoration law. As a result, next week\u2019s vote is on a knife edge. But the broader picture is still more disturbing.Amid concerns over the cost of living crisis, and a growing challenge from populist anti-green parties across Europe, mainstream conservatives are increasingly viewing opposition to the timetable and cost of the net zero transition as smart politics. In Germany, the extreme nationalists of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland are vying for second place in the polls, after leading attacks on government plans for the conversion of home heating systems to renewable energy. The centre-right Christian Democratic Union, which before the last election was contemplating coalition with the German Greens, is duly tacking in the same direction.In Spain \u2013 where a snap election this month may see the far right enter government for the first time since the return of democracy \u2013 the high-profile conservative mayor of the Madrid region has accused the left of overstating the gravity of the climate crisis. Elsewhere, the rise of the Farmer-Citizen Movement in the Netherlands, which opposes attempts to reduce nitrogen emissions from intensive farming, has come to symbolise a potential rural backlash against net zero targets. Centre-right parties, for which agricultural regions are traditional strongholds, are rushing to represent the cause.The world cannot afford for Europe to cool on its climate commitments. But as conservatives seek to turn the green deal into a dividing line, progressive leaders must respond to the threat where they have the power to do so. Much more needs to be done to persuade the less well-off and rural communities that they will be looked after in a time of upheaval. A renewed focus is needed on meaningful subsidies \u2013 for example, for homeowners switching to renewable forms of energy \u2013 and viable future pathways for those working in affected industries. Brussels\u2019 plan for a \u20ac87bn \u201csocial climate fund\u201d, due to be phased in from 2026, is nowhere near enough, given the scale and urgency of the task.A new age of economic and geopolitical insecurity has made a challenging transition even tougher. In the face of political headwinds, it will not be accomplished on the cheap.",

Conditions in the northern half of Australia between October through March were favourable for thunderstorms, it said. \u201cLower pressure lies across northern and central Australia, and gives rise to the vertical motion and low level convergence that favour thunderstorm development.\u201dBut it also said \u201csevere winter storms linked to cold fronts are common in the south-west of Western Australia and south-east South Australia.\u201dWhat effect does climate change have on thunderstorms?According to the CSIRO\u2019s 2022 state of the environment report, daily rainfall totals associated with storms have increased in Australia since 1979, especially in northern parts of the country. \u201cThis is primarily due to an increase in the intensity of rainfall per storm,\u201d it found. In future decades, Australia is projected to experience fewer tropical cyclones, but an increased proportion of high-intensity storms with higher rainfall.Rainfall events are predicted to intensify with global heating, as the atmosphere is able to hold about 7% more water vapour for each degree of warming.Rapid storm-related extreme rainfall events may intensify at an even higher rate, according to the Earth Systems and Climate Change Hub, because \u201cthe additional moisture in the atmosphere may also cause more intense convection for thunderstorms\u201d. Short duration rainfall intensity could increase by about 15% for each degree of warming, it has warned.Historical analysis by the BoM found no consistent link between peaks and troughs in thunderstorm frequency and El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a events.

Talking specifically about the likelihood of granting an exemption, he said: \u201cThe exemption bar is very high indeed, otherwise what is the point of the UK internal market?\u201dEnvironmental campaigners say the scheme is vital for reducing litter as well as CO2 emissions. But business leaders say it will add huge costs to their products, not only through the extra price of a bottle, but also with the associated production and administration costs.Jack told the Commons recently that under the scheme the price of a 12-pack of Scottish water sold at Aldi would rise from \u00a31.59 to \u00a33.99.If he persuades the cabinet to agree to refuse Holyrood\u2019s request, it is likely to provoke another constitutional row with the Scottish government just two months after Westminster blocked the Scottish gender recognition bill. That decision triggered acrimony between the two governments, arguably contributing to the decision by Nicola Sturgeon to resign as first minister weeks later.A spokesperson for the Scottish government said: \u201cWe expect a decision from the UK government as soon as possible given that this is what is needed to give industry absolute clarity.\u201dOne Holyrood official said the bottle deposit scheme was \u201cwholly within devolved competence and approved by the Scottish parliament in 2020 with cross-party support\u201d.Scottish ministers have been planning the DRS for years, with Lorna Slater, the green minister, calling it a \u201cmassive national undertaking\u201d, involving 4,000 producers, 10,000 \u201ctakeback\u201d machines, and 2bn drinks containers.The rest of the UK is planning its own bottle deposit scheme, but that will not start for another two years \u2013 and England will exempt glass bottles.

Humza Yousaf has suggested he would exclude small businesses in the scheme\u2019s first year of operation. His main rival, Kate Forbes, has said the scheme would cause carnage for businesses. Ash Regan has said she would scrap the scheme in its current form.Nevertheless, the Scottish government is pressing ahead with the plans, and this month it asked for an exemption from the UK Internal Market Act, which was passed in 2020 to replace the European single market and make sure goods continue to move freely around the UK.The importance of the exemption is disputed. Supporters of the bill recently commissioned a legal opinion from Stuart MacLennan, a professor of law at Coventry, which said the scheme could operate without one.UK ministers believe the exemption is needed for the scheme to apply to the 85% of drinks sold in Scotland that are made elsewhere. Some experts believe that without the exemption the entire scheme would be illegal.Kat Jones, the director of the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland, said: \u201cWe know that there has been a lot of work behind the scenes between UK government and the Scottish government officials to establish how the Scottish systems can operate most effectively in a UK context, and so this intervention from the secretary of state feels like an attempt to disrupt deposit return.\u201d",

        "text": "The formation of a supercontinent on Earth could wipe out humans and any other mammals that are still around in 250m years, according to a study.The mass extinction would be caused primarily by heat stress as a result of greater volcanic activity that would put twice as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as current levels, an older sun that would emit more radiation and the extent of inland deserts in the tropics.The supercontinent Pangea Ultima is expected to take shape when all the current continents merge together in the distant future. The paper, which was published on Monday in Nature Geoscience, is the first attempt to model how extreme the climate might become from that geological rearrangement.Using a UK Met Office climate model and the University of Bristol supercomputer, the simulation also provided tectonic clues to past extinction events and data that could be of use to astronomers looking for other habitable planets.In the era of Pangea Ultima, the temperature extremes are expected to be dramatic, with more humidity than now along the coasts and extremely arid conditions in the vast inland deserts. In this world, global temperatures could rise 15C (and up to 30C on land) above pre-industrial levels, which would return the world to the extreme heat it last went through in the Permian\u2013Triassic era, 260m years ago, when more than 90% of species were eradicated. Protracted periods of heat in excess of 40C would be beyond the tolerance levels of many life forms.Mammals have been the world\u2019s great evolutionary success story, particularly since the demise of the dinosaurs during the last great extinction event, but mammals\u2019 ability to adapt to heat may be too slow. That includes humans, which have been on Earth for a relatively short period.Hominids emerged about 6m years ago when the world was a much cooler place than it had been during the dinosaur period. Although our species has developed remarkably quickly, we would face enormous challenges in the era of Pangea Ultima, assuming we make it through the current self-caused climate crisis and mass extinction of other species.In addition to the direct impacts of heat, there would be severe food supply problems due to a collapse of vegetation. The paper notes that most plants become stressed at temperatures over 40C and break down completely if exposed to 60C for protracted periods.The paper\u2019s lead author, Alexander Farnsworth, from the University of Bristol, said the prospect of another extinction event, which includes humans, was a sobering reminder of transience. \u201cThe Earth has a very changeable environment. Humans are very lucky with what we have now and we should not be pushing our own climate beyond the cooler climate that we evolved through. We are the dominant species but Earth and its climate decide how long that lasts,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat comes after is anyone\u2019s guess. The dominant species could be something completely new.\u201dThe authors acknowledge their prediction has a high level of uncertainty due to the ultra-long-term timeframe, but they hope the study, which was initiated during the pandemic lockdown, will provide useful insights into past mass extinction events and the possible habitability of other planets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A quarter of the fin whales, the second-largest mammal on Earth after the blue whale, considered \u201cvulnerable\u201d globally by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, had to be harpooned a second time. Only 59% died instantly.The report, described as alarming by Iceland\u2019s minister of food agriculture and fisheries, found the killing of some whales had taken too long. The provisions of the animal welfare act on hunting had not been violated, it found, due to the \u201cbest known\u201d methods used by the hunt. But it questioned whether hunting large whales could meet animal welfare objectives and referred its finding to an expert animal welfare council to decide.Animal welfare campaigners described the findings as intolerable and unacceptable and called on the Icelandic government to halt all whale hunts.Svand\u00eds Svavarsd\u00f3ttir, Iceland\u2019s minister of food, agriculture and fisheries, said: \u201cThis alarming report underscores the need for a discussion in Iceland about the values we want to be known for. I believe that industries incapable of guaranteeing animal welfare should be considered part of our past rather than our future. This report, along with the expert council on animal welfare\u2019s findings, will serve as essential background material for making decisions about the future of whaling post 2023.\u201dIceland is one of the few countries that hunts whales commercially, along with Norway and Japan, despite a ban on commercial whaling that has been in place since 1986 under the international whaling commission.However, Svavarsd\u00f3ttir said last year that the country planned to end whaling from 2024 as demand dwindled. Last August, the ministry issued a regulation requiring the food and veterinary authority (MAST) to carry out regular inspections of whaling hunts, in order to promote animal welfare.Patrick Ramage, senior director at the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), said: \u201cWhatever their views on whaling, both Icelanders and the international community will be horrified by these findings. No animal \u2013 however it is killed \u2013 should suffer for such a long time. Whales are sentient, intelligent and complex creatures that suffer both physically and psychologically during this traumatic massacre.\u201d\u201cThere is no humane way to kill a whale at sea. This new evidence underscores how outdated this practice is. It has to end immediately \u2013 no one in Iceland is dependent on this meat.\u201dIn Iceland, 148 whales were killed in 2022. The hunting of 58 whales was filmed and analysed by experts on behalf of the food and veterinary authority. It showed, of the 36 whales shot more than once, five whales were shot three times and four whales were shot four times. One whale with a harpoon in its back was chased for five hours without success.\u00c1rni Finnsson, the chair of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association, said: \u201cThis killing is inhumane; it has to stop. There is no economic benefit for Iceland and it undermines the country\u2019s record as a pro-conservation nation.\u201dDanny Groves, a spokesperson for Whale and Dolphin Conservation, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that time to death in these hunts can take 20-25 minutes. It will be an agonising death because these are sentient beings. They will experience great pain.\u201cYou\u2019re using a grenade-tipped harpoon from a moving ship to a moving target.

The country\u2019s public prosecutor said it is investigating a possible case of \u201cecocide\u201d.Ukraine and Russia have each accused the other of deliberately blasting the main concrete barrier. Other media point to satellite data that shows a road across the dam was already partly inundated in recent days and that water levels were at a record high.The German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, blamed Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine for the collapse and described the explosion as an \u201cenvironmental catastrophe\u201d.Analysts told the Guardian that the scale of the damage would depend on the amount of water released and the extent of the damage to the barrier, both of which are still unknown. At the very least, it has forced the evacuation of thousands of people, flooded national parks and jeopardised water supplies to millions of people. In the worst-case scenario, it may pose a long-term danger to Europe\u2019s biggest nuclear plant, Zaporizhzhia, and could also spread agrotoxins and petrochemicals into the Black Sea.Rising flood water in central Kherson around 300 meters from the Dnipro river. Photograph: Ed Ram/The GuardianThe International Energy Agency tweeted that its experts at Zaporizhzhia, which is 100 miles (160km) upstream, are closely monitoring the situation. They said there was \u201cno immediate nuclear safety risk at plant\u201d, because the cooling pools are already full.This could change in the future, if the reservoir behind the dam is significantly depleted, which would make it difficult to replenish the cooling system and operate the diesel generators.Former minister of ecology Ostap Semerak told the Guardian that in his opinion this was the greatest threat currently posed by the breach, but other dangers could emerge in the days and weeks ahead as flood waters engulf cities, petrol stations and farms, become contaminated by agrochemicals and oil products and then flow into the Black Sea.\u201cThis will have an impact on Romania, Georgia, Turkey and Bulgaria. It will be harmful for all the region\u201d he said. \u201cOur government has announced this is the biggest environmental catastrophe in Europe over the past 10 years, and I think it may be the worst in Ukraine since Chornobyl in 1986.\u201dThe turbine room at the hydropower plant is already under water and 150 tonnes of industrial lubricants have been washed away, according to Zelenskiy.Olena Kravchenko, the director of the Ukrainian Environment People Law NGO, said Russia\u2019s \u201cecocide\u201d risked \u201cunprecedented environmental consequences\u201d to the areas downstream of the Dnipro River, the Dnipro estuary, and ecosystems in the coastal area of the Black Sea.With images of entire houses being washed away, she says the river will be polluted by debris and hazardous chemicals. Water supplies could be reduced or cut in several cities, including Kherson, and irrigation may prove impossible in swathes of agricultural land, affecting crops.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Residents of a major Texas city just west of the Permian Basin, the largest oil field in the US, will have the chance to vote on the package this spring.If the proposal passes, the city of El Paso would adopt a comprehensive climate policy that would include prohibiting the use of city water for extraction projects outside city limits, such as in the Permian Basin, which makes up roughly 40% of all US oil production.\u201cEl Paso is on the verge of potentially passing one of the most progressive pieces of climate legislation in the country,\u201d said Deirdre Shelly, campaigns director for the national Sunrise Movement.Oil wells guzzle precious California water. Next door, residents can\u2019t use the tapRead moreProponents say the climate charter would prepare El Paso to withstand extreme weather events and accelerate the city\u2019s transition to renewables, requiring 80% of its energy to come from carbon free sources by 2030. It also encourages rooftop solar development, proposes establishing a climate department and could move the ownership of El Paso Electric into the city\u2019s hands. The utility company was purchased in 2020 by a JP Morgan-tied fund.\u201cWe\u2019re battling the fossil fuel giants in our community,\u201d said Ana Fuentes, a 25-year-old resident of El Paso and a campaign manager for the local Sunrise chapter. \u201cThis charter would allow people to have the platform and a space where our concerns will be prioritized over the bottom line of fossil fuel oligarchs.\u201dLast July, Sunrise El Paso and Austin-based Ground Game Texas submitted nearly 40,000 petition signatures to get the climate charter on the ballot for the November 2022 election, but due to a prolonged verification process, the vote on the plan will take place in the 6 May election. Roughly half of the petition signers were people under the age of 35.\u201cSomething [we] talk a lot about a lot is climate anxiety, and I think we all feel it and it shows in those numbers,\u201d Fuentes said.The climate charter has the potential to disrupt drilling in the Permian Basin. The proposed policy would ban the use of city water for fossil fuel activities outside of El Paso limits. The annual amount of freshwater used for fracking the Texas side of the Permian Basin was estimated at 72bn gallons in 2019. That is a 2,400% rise from 2010, according to the US Geological Survey.\u201cWe would be able to preserve the water within our desert community for household use, instead of having that water be sent to fracking and fossil fuel projects outside the city,\u201d said Fuentes.Fracking uses large amounts of water that is scarce in desert communities like El Paso. On top of that, this process of extracting natural gas has been shown to cause groundwater contamination.Water used for fracking is \u201claced with chemicals [and then] percolates through to people\u2019s agricultural fields and sometimes wells where people drink them\u201d, said Mark Jacobson, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University. The fossil fuel activities in the Permian Basin, which have been termed a \u201ccarbon bomb\u201d by environmentalists, release planet-heating methane and volatile organic compounds associated with poor air quality that can degrade human health.Red states leading the US in solar and wind production, new report showsRead moreThe El Paso chamber of commerce, a membership group representing the interest of businesses, wrote in an emailed statement that it opposes the climate charter, stating that the proposition \u201chas the right endgame in mind \u2013 an improved climate, but doing so will cost us the very livelihoods it seeks to enrich\u201d. The chamber claims that the climate charter would pose a \u201cclear detrimental effect to local businesses and regional economy\u201d, according to the findings from the economic impact report that the chamber paid for.Sharon Wilson, an organizer with the non-profit Earthworks who previously worked in the oil and gas industry, said this type of fear mongering from industry stakeholders is par for the course when environmentalists propose bold climate action.\u201cThe oil and gas industry actually uses some of the same tactics that the tobacco industry used to deceive the public about the harm of tobacco,\u201d said Wilson. Indeed, there is a documented history of companies like Exxon and Chevron borrowing from the tobacco industry\u2019s playbook.\u201cAt some point the tobacco industry was not allowed to advertise any more and that needs to happen with the oil and gas industry.\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSmoking is a choice, breathing air is not.\u201d The headline of this article was amended on 10 March 2023.

Global heating to drive stronger La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o events by 2030, researchers sayRead moreHe estimated that over the last three years on average the shoreline has retreated by about 20 metres, while the sand dunes have receded between 7m and 10m and vertically eroded by 2m to 3m.Usually, some turtle nesting occurs along that stretch of coast between November and January \u2013 \u201c30 or so every year\u201d, Leon estimates. \u201cThis year there have been no nests.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m assuming that it is because the beach and dunes have been eroded so there\u2019s no place where turtles can [make] their nests,\u201d he said, noting that there had been nesting activity further south, where beaches were less eroded.\u201cIf you were to leave a coastal system by itself, the beach would move a lot. The real problem is when you have infrastructure behind, or even worse, on those dunes.\u201d Leon cited Main Beach and Maroochydore as particularly vulnerable areas.The Queensland analysis is in keeping with the findings of satellite research that studied more than 8,300km of coastline along the Pacific basin, looking at the effects of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation on wave-dominated sandy beaches.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nEnso oscillates between warm El Ni\u00f1o, cold La Ni\u00f1a and neutral phases as a result of differences in sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean.Of the Australian coastline analysed, the researchers found that between 1984 and 2022, 48% of beaches experienced significant erosion during La Ni\u00f1a years.\u201cThat signal is very clear in south-east Australia,\u201d said the study\u2019s first author, Dr Kilian Vos of the University of New South Wales. The erosion during La Ni\u00f1a was linked to a 7% increase in wave power and sea level changes, Vos said.Conversely, El Ni\u00f1o was associated with an accumulation of sand across 75% of beaches analysed. Enso appeared to have the opposite effect on the other side of the Pacific, resulting in the accretion of sand on to beaches during La Ni\u00f1a years along the west coast of the Americas.\u201cEnso is very asymmetric,\u201d Vos said. \u201cEl Ni\u00f1o events are very intense and very short, while La Ni\u00f1a events are rarely as strong but they last much longer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

John F Kennedy international airport measured 8in of rainfall in one day, the most since records began, while Brooklyn received a month\u2019s worth of rain in just a few hours. People had to be rescued from swamped basement apartments, subway and bus services were canceled and sewage backed up in overwhelmed pipes.Climate scientists have stressed that such pounding rainfall is a symptom of a warming planet, with a hotter atmosphere able to hold more moisture that is then unleashed in torrential downpours.\u201cHuman-driven climate change plays a dual role, both intensifying these storms and warming the atmosphere,\u201d said Davide Faranda, a scientist at the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace in France. \u201cDeeper storms yield more intense phenomena, while a warmer atmosphere can accommodate a greater amount of rain.\u201dTommaso Alberti, a researcher at Italy\u2019s Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, said that the extreme event that hit New York \u201caligns with climate change projections\u201d. He added that while natural variability can deliver major storms, \u201chuman-driven climate change is the primary driver, underscoring the urgent need for climate mitigation and adaptation efforts\u201d.Global heating has fueled contrasting extremes in rainfall across the US. While much of the arid south-west has faced prolonged drought \u2013 punctuated by occasional disastrous flooding events \u2013 the US north-east, including New York, has seen a significant increase in heavy rainfall. The amount of precipitation falling in heavy events in the region has increased 55% since the 1950s, a federal government analysis has found, with climate change the main cause of this.Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania and author of a new book on the climate crisis, said that rapid attribution studies can miss some of the mechanisms that cause extreme weather, but that the increased threat of flooding was nevertheless undeniable.\u201cNew York is experiencing a very clear increase in these extreme \u2013 more than 2in per hour \u2013 rainfall events, and that\u2019s clearly tied to a warming atmosphere,\u201d he said.Such flooding can be deadly. In 2021, New York was hit by Hurricane Ida, which caused 11 people to die from flooding that seeped into the basement apartments where many New Yorkers live.Following scenes where parts of New York again resembled a giant, fetid swimming pool, and less than four months after the city\u2019s skies turned a toxic orange from wildfire smoke, questions have been raised about the preparedness of the metropolis, along with many other major cities, to escalating climate impacts.\u201cThe sad reality is our climate is changing faster than our infrastructure can respond,\u201d Rohit Aggarwala, commissioner of the New York City department of environmental protection, admitted on Friday. Pipes and drains could not cope with the flood water, while the leadership of the city and state \u2013 including the city\u2019s mayor, Eric Adams, and the governor, Kathy Hochul \u2013 has come under criticism for responding too slowly to the looming threat posed by the rainfall.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that our cities and our aging infrastructure were built for a climate that no longer exists, particularly as a warmed atmosphere holds and releases more water,\u201d said Daniel Zarrilli, the former chief climate policy adviser to New York City.\u201cThis requires not only greater investment to deal with the new extremes, but also the creativity to think differently about design for when the capacity of our infrastructure is inevitably exceeded.\u201d",

Those who warned of diminishing supplies were considered catastrophists and investment was postponed.Three consecutive years of drought have almost emptied the reservoir of fresh water, and to avoid shortages the state-run water supplier, OSE, has since the beginning of the year been gradually adding brackish water from the Rio de la Plata estuary.By early May the mix had reached the maximum levels of sodium and chlorides recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), and now it has double those levels, giving the water a repulsive taste and raising questions about potential effects on health.Authorities maintain that the chemicals only affect the taste and smell of the water and do not necessarily pose a risk to most people\u2019s health.Some vulnerable groups such as babies, pregnant women and people with health conditions have been warned against drinking the water but there have been conflicting claims about its safety for the broader population.A protester holds a sign that reads \u2018For water, for life\u2019 in Montevideo in May. Photograph: Santiago Mazzarovich/AP\u00c1lvaro Mombr\u00fa, the dean of the chemistry faculty at the Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica, said he would not recommend its consumption at present, while his colleague Arturo Briva, the dean of the medicine faculty, said the water was still considered safe but warned that \u201cas levels rise and time of exposure increases, some repercussions may appear\u201d.Experts have advised taking shorter showers, and there have been increased reports of damage to water heaters.A poll in May found that roughly half of people in the area affected had reduced their consumption of tap water and 35% had stopped drinking it completely.The government has exempted bottled water from taxes and announced it would provide free bottled water to more than 500,000 people.Mario Bidegain, a meteorologist, said calculating the amount of rain needed to bring the situation back to normal was a difficult task. If there are heavy rains as expected by early September, authorities will still have to decide whether to reduce the sodium and chloride levels back to normal or keep some kind of mix to preserve supplies in case the drought continues. \u201cWe will probably come out of this slowly,\u201d Bidegain said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They are considered a delicacy in fine-dining restaurants, known for their creamy yellow yolks and beautiful speckled shells, and can sell for more than \u00a38 each.While delighting gourmet diners, conservationists are concerned that the taste for these eggs is damaging a threatened species, which has a UK breeding population of only 140,000 and is amber-listed by the RSPB.The number of licences awarded in 2022 was at an all-time low of 2,500, but conservationists say that is still too many and egg collecting should stop completely, particularly given the additional pressure birds are under from avian flu.Jeff Knott, the RSPB\u2019s director of policy, said: \u201cWith many of our seabird species under increasing pressure from climate change, food availability and bird flu, the collecting of black-headed gull eggs for food is unsustainable, unhelpful and should stop.\u201dLicensing data seen by the Guardian shows that in 2019 more than 60,000 eggs were allowed to be taken, and licences were granted for more than 95,000 in 2020. In 2021, there was a moratorium on taking eggs in Hampshire over concerns about it being unsustainable. As a result, the total number was much lower, with 7,000 licensed to be taken in 2021 and 2,500 in 2022, as the moratorium was maintained.Martin Slater, the deputy chief executive at Yorkshire Wildlife Trust, said: \u201cMany of our once-common wildlife species are in decline, including black-headed gulls, so we\u2019re surprised to see these licences are still being issued in Yorkshire.\u201cWe\u2019d like to see these licences finally ending here too, and eggs from these threatened birds permanently taken out of sale and off all menus,\u201d he added.In 2009, a paper published in the journal Acta Oecologica showed that although most black-headed gulls lay more to replace the eggs that are taken, this uses up a lot of energy, which means harvested sites had \u201cpoorer hatching success and chick survival\u201d.According to the study, which focused on a colony in Hampshire, the depletion of the female\u2019s reserves also reduced her chances of survival and successfully breeding in the future. Other birds could also be disturbed during collection.The gulls\u2019 eggs are typically sold to wholesalers, large food markets such as Billingsgate in London and high-end restaurants, where they are promoted as a seasonal delicacy. During the 1930s, nearly 300,000 eggs a year were traded in London\u2019s Leadenhall Market.The licensed collectors are known as \u201ceggers\u201d.Dr Malcolm Hudson, an associate professor in environmental science at Southampton University, and a co-author of the Acta Oecologica study, researched the colony in Lymington, Hampshire. He said eggers visited sites daily and took eggs from nests with only one egg to ensure it was less than 24 hours old, systematically working their way through the colony.Hudson said: \u201cI don\u2019t agree with collecting black-headed gull eggs in the UK \u2013 they are a bird of conservation concern, protected by our laws, with declining numbers and few thriving breeding sites.\u201cThe collection does nothing to enhance our food security \u2013 it\u2019s a very small numbers of eggs consumed by a tiny (affluent and well-nourished) portion of our population.\u201dNatural England only grants licences to people who have a \u201ctraditional claim\u201d, which generally means it runs in families, particularly among the fishing community. The window for collection is 1 April to 15 May, with a collector being paid \u00a32 to \u00a33 an egg.Stephanie Bird-Halton, the regulatory director at Natural England, said: \u201cNatural England recognises the collection of black-headed gull eggs as a lawful activity, which is licensable under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.Rack of squirrel, anyone? The chefs putting invasive species on the menuRead more\u201cA relatively small number of eggs are harvested annually, which does not negatively impact the population at the national or local scale, given black-headed gulls can produce multiple egg clutches and continue to breed successfully following egg harvesting.\u201dHowever, conservationists say the practice is hard to monitor.Dr Alexander Lees, a conservation biologist at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: \u201cAlthough a sustainable harvest of seabird eggs is theoretically possible, this provision opens the door for the sale of illegally harvested eggs \u2013 such depredations have been reported at many sites, including Poole harbour, and have impacted non-target species such as the rarer Mediterranean gull, necessitating police protection.\u201dFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

The climate corps had been proposed in early versions of the sweeping climate law approved last year but was jettisoned amid strong opposition from Republicans and concerns about cost.Democrats and environmental advocacy groups never gave up on the plan and pushed Biden in recent weeks to issue an executive order authorizing what the White House now calls the American Climate Corps. The program is modeled after the Civilian Conservation Corps, created in the 1930s by the Democratic president Franklin D Roosevelt as part of the New Deal.\u201cThis summer, our country saw heat waves, wildfires and floods that destroyed communities, uprooted families and claimed hundreds of lives,\u201d the Sunrise Movement and other organizations wrote on Monday in a letter to Biden\u2019s White House.\u201cWhile previous executive orders and legislation under your administration demonstrate tremendous progress toward meeting our Paris climate goals and your campaign promises, this summer has made clear that we must be as ambitious as possible in tackling the great crisis of our time,\u201d the groups wrote.More than 50 Democratic lawmakers, including the Massachusetts senator Ed Markey and the New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also encouraged Biden to create a climate corps, saying in a separate letter on Monday that \u201cthe climate crisis demands a whole-of-government response at an unprecedented scale\u201d.The lawmakers cited deadly heatwaves in the south-west and across the nation, as well as dangerous floods in New England and devastating wildfires on the Hawaiian island of Maui, among recent examples of climate-related disasters.A federal climate corps would \u201cprepare a whole generation of workers for good-paying union jobs in the clean economy\u201d while helping to \u201cfight climate change, build community resilience and support environmental justice\u201d, the lawmakers wrote.The White House declined to say how much the program will cost or how it will be paid for, but Democrats proposed $10bn for the climate corps in the climate bill before the provision was removed.Republicans have largely dismissed the climate corps as a do-gooder proposal that would waste money and could even take jobs away from other workers displaced by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201cWe don\u2019t need another FDR program, and the idea that this is going to help land management is a false idea as well,\u201d the Arkansas representative Bruce Westerman, chairman of the House natural resources committee, said in 2021.Congressman Joe Neguse, a Colorado Democrat who has co-sponsored a climate corps bill, said it was important to train the next generation of federal land managers, park rangers and other stewards of our natural resources. Neguse and other Democrats have said the program should pay \u201ca living wage\u201d while offering healthcare coverage and support for childcare, housing, transportation and education.A key distinction between the original Civilian Conservation Corps and the new climate contingent is that, unlike the in 1930s, the US economy is not in an economic depression. The US unemployment rate was 3.8% in August, low by historical measures.The new corps is also likely to be far more diverse than the largely white and male force created 90 years ago.The White House climate adviser, Ali Zaidi, said the administration would work with at least six federal agencies to create the climate corps and would pair with at least 10 states. California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan and Washington have already begun similar programs, while five more are launching their own climate corps, Zaidi said: Arizona, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina and Utah.The initiative will provide job training and service opportunities to work on a wide range of projects that tackle the climate crisis, including restoring coastal wetlands to protect communities from storm surges and flooding; deploying clean energy projects such as wind and solar power; managing forests to improve health and prevent catastrophic wildfires; and implementing energy efficient solutions to cut energy bills for consumers, the White House said.",

Two frigate birds and one red-footed booby were confirmed to have died from the virus on Tuesday, after samples were sent to Guayaquil on the Ecuadorian mainland for examination.Park guards and veterinarians are redoubling efforts to protect the islands\u2019 78 species of endemic and native birds, including flightless cormorants, the only species of penguin in the northern hemisphere and one of the largest albatross colonies in the world.The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands\u2019 unique bird species were observed by Charles Darwin in 1835 when he visited the isolated archipelago on HMS Beagle and helped him set out his theory of evolution by natural selection in On the Origin of Species. They are considered particularly vulnerable due to their low immunity, small populations and the effect of rising ocean temperatures.Scientists say the virus was probably brought to the islands by migratory birds. Last year, Ecuador declared an emergency due to outbreaks of avian influenza on farms. In neighbouring Peru, the highly contagious virus ripped through seabird populations, killing as many as 200,000 as well as decimating marine mammals such as sea lions.National park technicians examine birds on Genovesa Island. Photograph: Parque Nacional Gal\u00e1pagos/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Gal\u00e1pagos national park activated emergency health protocols on Sunday following the report of dozens of dead and sick birds on two islands, Wolf and Genovesa, in the northern part of the Pacific archipelago, which lies about 1,000km from the South American continent.Rueda said red-footed boobies were showing a \u201chigher number of dead birds but also more symptoms [such as] erratic behaviour\u201d characteristic of bird flu.Two visitor sites were closed on Espa\u00f1ola Island, the only place where the critically endangered waved albatross breeds, though there were no confirmed cases of the birds with the virus.\u201cOur main worry is for the endemic species,\u201d said Rueda. \u201cTheir populations are quite small and are restricted to the Gal\u00e1pagos.\u201d\u201cIt is very worrying to find a dead bird or a bird that has given a positive result, so we have to triple the biosecurity efforts on tourist boats, for tourists and crew members,\u201d he said.Gustavo Jim\u00e9nez, principal investigator for the Charles Darwin Foundation, said many species including boobies, albatross and the endangered Gal\u00e1pagos penguin were facing scarcer food sources due to El Ni\u00f1o, and the resulting stress made them more susceptible to pathogens such as avian flu.\u201cThe endemic species are very sensitive to any disease,\u201d he said. \u201cOur best defence is prevention.\u201dScientists also fear that, as it has on the mainland, the virus could jump to endangered Gal\u00e1pagos sea lions and fur seals.A warning has been issued calling on tourists visiting the Unesco Natural Heritage of Humanity site not to try to touch affected birds.

But their powerful, haunting voices, used for communication and marking territory, are a blessing and a curse.\u201cGibbons are one of the most popular primates for pets in the illegal wildlife trade and Siamangs are one of the biggest targets because of their beautiful forest singing,\u201d said Made Wedana, country director for the Indonesia programme of the Aspinall Foundation wildlife charity.\u201cAll gibbons sing, but Siamangs are the loudest. They\u2019re also very beautiful animals, and \u2026 very rare in the wild.\u201dGibbons are popular targets for the illegal wildlife trade, with Siamangs prized for their beauty and powerful singing voices. Photograph: The Aspinall FoundationSiamang gibbons are found in rainforests in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. But the illegal pet trade \u2013 alongside habitat loss from plantations, mining and logging \u2013 means numbers in the wild are declining, and they are listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List.In 2023, the Aspinall Foundation completed work on a rehabilitation centre in Punti Kayu, South Sumatra \u2013 the first of its kind to rehabilitate Siamang gibbons and return them to the wild. On 23 December, the first pair, Jon and Cimung, were released.Jon and Cimung being prepared for release. \u2018They took to their surroundings very naturally,\u2019 says Made Wedana. Photograph: The Aspinall Foundation\u201cBoth of them were kept as pets. Jon\u2019s condition was extremely bad \u2013 he had severe diarrhoea and was acutely malnourished. We were concerned he wouldn\u2019t survive,\u201d Wedana said.The rehabilitation process took five years. Siamangs often have to learn how to find food in the wild and defend themselves from predators. There\u2019s also a pair-bonding process, which gives them a better chance of surviving among other territorial gibbons in the area.\u201cSiamangs are monogamous \u2013 they pair for life,\u201d said Amos Courage, director of overseas projects for the Aspinall Foundation. \u201cBut pair-bonding can be tricky. In enclosures, gibbons can seem bonded, but once released they don\u2019t always get on.\u201dWedana, who accompanied the pair to their release, said it went perfectly. \u201cThe two Siamangs took to their surroundings very naturally and in the afternoon they started calling, which is a hugely positive sign.\u201dThe team will now monitor the gibbons on foot for about four months to make sure they are able to fend for themselves. If all goes well, other wild-born Siamangs rescued from the pet trade will be released in South Sumatra.Siamangs are found crammed into small cages for sale, alongside other wild animals, at markets in towns and cities across Indonesia, as well as online. They are often infants, whose parents were killed so their offspring could be stolen and sold.\u201cIt\u2019s a miserable existence,\u201d said Courage. \u201cAn animal used to swinging through vast primary forest is shoved in an enclosure, usually in someone\u2019s small house in an urban area, and given completely inappropriate food.The gibbons will be monitored for four months to make sure they are coping with life in the wild.

Their lives are severely reduced in captivity.\u201cIt can be painful. They pick up diseases and sometimes come to us badly traumatised,\u201d he said.I discovered \u2026 chimps using tools \u2013 and people wouldn\u2019t believe meRead moreKeeping protected species is illegal in Indonesia. But enforcement of those laws is limited, Courage said, with a lack of equipped sanctuaries that can quarantine and conduct health checks on confiscated animals.\u201cDeforestation is also exacerbating the issue because you have people going into areas they wouldn\u2019t have gone to before and coming across wild animals,\u201d Courage added. \u201cFrequently, the animals are killed and eaten or caught and sold as pets.\u201dThe most effective way to protect Siamang gibbons is to reduce demand, Wedana added. \u201cIn Sumatra, not many people are aware of this sad situation,\u201d said Wedana, who is helping to develop a public education project. \u201cIn the future, it will be better if there\u2019s no need for this rehabilitation centre.\u201d\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X (formerly known as Twitter) for all the latest news and features\n",

It focuses on a friendship with a big friendly fish \u2013 the blue groper; and the powerful response to humans threatening the animal. As with My Octopus Teacher, it\u2019s a highly emotive story, and seen by most people as unusual or unique. Because humans only befriend domestic animals such as cats and dogs. Or do they?Let\u2019s start with the blue groper. This is a charismatic Australian native, with many interesting characteristics. They are protogynous hermaphrodites, starting life as juveniles with the potential to be male or female; and always starting as green-coloured females. The dominant male has a harem and, if he dies, the largest female will become male and adopt the striking blue hue which gives the fish its name. These fish can live up to 70 years and are the state emblem of New South Wales.Blueback review \u2013 Tim Winton adaptation hammers home its climate messageRead moreBeyond the science, these are extraordinarily curious and friendly fish. As a regular snorkeller and diver, I am often greeted by a groper who will shove his face in my camera, rub up against my hands, bop me with his lips and follow me around. Gropers appear to recognise divers and are curious about what we are doing. It is illegal to spear these animals in my home state but such is my emotional response to their friendliness, I can imagine jumping in front of a weapon aimed at one of my friends.Octopuses are similarly interactive and interested in us. They are invertebrates who have developed unique, extraordinary intelligence, diverging from us evolutionarily more than 600m years ago. They use tools and mimicry, construct shelters, steal things and are known to be escape artists when kept in captivity.In Sydney we primarily interact with the gloomy octopus (Octopus tetricus). One of my life\u2019s highlights was the first time one of these creatures unfurled a tentacle and explored my hand. Since then I\u2019ve had many interactions, including octopuses riding on my hand, trying desperately to steal my camera, and some who tell me to go away by blowing sand at me. Unfortunately, octopuses don\u2019t live long \u2013 usually becoming senescent after breeding and lasting only one to two years. The ones we see regularly are often eaten by smooth stingrays in the blink of an eye. It\u2019s hard to get too fond of them as the end is always near.Once you have a relationship and an attachment to another living creature, they become part of your sphere of compassionMoving to the land, and most of us are familiar with wild birds seeking human company. Yes, they are often after food, but who isn\u2019t? My neighbourhood is dominated by sulphur-crested cockatoos, but it only takes a little patience to have a rainbow lorikeet or a king parrot work up the courage to stand on a human hand.Even tiny insects can notice humans and change their behaviour to interact with us. Jumping spiders are in almost everyone\u2019s garden but you might miss them if you don\u2019t look hard. Most are less than half a centimetre long. Lock eyes with one, however, and there\u2019s no doubt that they see you, moving their bodies to make eye contact. Also fans of cameras, they sometimes jump right at you!Relationships with wild animals are possible and common \u2013 you can have your own Blueback or My Octopus Teacher experience. Return to the same place often enough and you\u2019ll get to know the regulars. Getting to know animals as individuals with varying personalities and behaviour grants them elevated importance. But be aware that it is likely to push you closer to vegetarianism and inspire you towards conservation. Because once you have a relationship and an attachment to another living creature, they become part of your sphere of compassion. And then there is no choice but to protect both the animal and its environment. A \u201cpet\u201d blue groper or a labrador? You can have both, and it will probably make you a better human.\nKate Ahmad is a neurologist and diver with an interest in human and animal behaviour and conservation\n",

Each layer of shell equates to one year of its life, and so can reveal what happened in the tortoise\u2019s surrounding environment.Five different chelonians from natural history collections were studied. One of these came from Enewetak Atoll, and was collected in 1978. Enewetak Atoll and its neighbour, Bikini Atoll, in the Pacific, were the site of 67 nuclear tests, with Enewetak the site of 43 of these. Though the sea turtle was probably not alive during the time of the testing, researchers still found uranium contamination in the turtle 20 years after testing ended.However, consumption of uranium-contaminated algae, or other legacy contamination present in the atoll, may have contributed to the presence of uranium in that turtle.Researchers also looked at an eastern box turtle from Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in the US. Oak Ridge is the site of a nuclear facility that has produced and processed uranium since 1943. The turtle that was studied from there was collected in 1962 and may have bioaccumulated radionuclides, or radioactive materials, from uranium waste products in the area.The researchers were able to identify uranium isotopic composition across the scute from these turtles.The research supports the idea that these animals can bioaccumulate human-made radionuclides, or from the environment. It also supports the idea that these animals, which often live a long time, can record information about human activity with nuclear landscapes over a long period.\u201cWe anticipate that combining analyses of historically collected and modern specimens will significantly expand our environmental monitoring abilities as they relate to ongoing nuclear contamination questions,\u201d the study said.",

The agency has had to downgrade the number of properties it aims to protect by 2027 from 336,000 to 200,000.New houses were being built on floodplains without checks being carried out to make sure suitable flood defences had been put in place, the MPs said. They described the failure as \u201cunforgivable\u201d.Some 5.7 million properties were at risk of flooding in England in 2022 and 2023 and this number is expected to increase as climate breakdown brings more intense downpours more often.Flooding across the UK earlier this month damaged nearly 2,000 properties.Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, deputy chair of the Commons committee, said robust flood resilience must become a priority.\u201cThe depredations caused by such disasters are a matter of life and death for communities up and down the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis inquiry has uncovered the alarming truth that in a number of ways, the approach to keeping our citizens safe in this area is contradictory and self-defeating, not least in the continuing development of new housing in areas of high flood risk without appropriate mitigations.\u201dThe committee said the government should set a measure of how many properties were protected from flooding that took into account the number with poor defences, as well as new constructions.It should also ensure that smaller projects found it easier to get approval so that rural villages had the same right to protection as others, they said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They said they were rough animals,\u201d Mpofu said.His father was a farm labourer on the edge of Hwange national park in Zimbabwe. Painted dogs, contrary to what the bosses of Mpofu\u2019s father said, are not scavengers. Nor are they hyenas, which are much larger, only distantly related and steal their prey. But farmers still shoot them. Conservationists and tourists show little interest in them. Poachers aiming for antelopes ensnare them. Cars run them over.Starved of habitat, maligned and hunted, painted dogs have plummeted in number from an estimated half a million to fewer than 7,000, surviving on the edge of oblivion in a few pockets of southern Africa. Scientists believe climate change threatens to wipe them out completely. As underdogs go, they are hard to beat.Jealous Mpofu. Photograph: TuskBut they do have some friends, and none more friendly than the man who has been recognised by the charity Tusk as its ranger of the year for his work over a quarter of a century bringing these curious animals back from the brink.Mpofu, 54, had never seen a painted dog until 1997, he said in an interview from his office to reveal news of his award. He grew up trekking barefoot to school and worked for years as a casual labourer in Zimbabwe\u2019s national park system, but left the job when he saw the country \u201cgoing down\u201d.His life changed when he met Peter Blinston, a Briton who founded Painted Dog Conservation after learning about the animals in a Jane Goodall documentary at the age of eight.Mpofu became the charity\u2019s first ranger, and as money trickled in he crisscrossed Hwange searching for dogs, often walking 20 miles to the nearest mechanic when the charity\u2019s one vehicle broke down.Tragedy struck in 2006 when the alpha male in Hwange\u2019s last pack was killed and the group dispersed. Mpofu and the team brought the alpha female into a new rehabilitation enclosure. For six months Hwange had no painted dogs in the wild.They released the female and chose an alpha male from the enclosure. In the years that followed the female dog raised as many as 30 puppies. \u201cNow we are following some of these offspring,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we did a nice job.\u201dMpofu is in charge of six rangers who track the five packs the project looks after. Together they amount to between 150 and 200 dogs, roaming more than 1,000 square miles. Each morning he wakes at 4am and heads off into the bush with his radio equipment, sometimes staying days at a time and alerting anti-poaching units to sweep an area for snares when he finds a pack. He knows each of his dogs by the unique markings on their left and right sides.Blinston credits Mpofu with saving dozens of dogs\u2019 lives. Last year he found four in one pack ensnared together. \u201cOne by one, as I found them, we got the snares off,\u201d he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The main drivers of loss were logging, the expansion of agriculture and wildfires.Mountains are home to more than 85% of the world\u2019s birds, mammals and amphibians. These habitats were once more protected than their lowland equivalents because their rugged terrain made them less accessible, the paper notes. Today, they are increasingly threatened as humans exploit harder-to-reach areas of the planet, and lowland forests are given greater protection.Map of mountain forest loss\u201cOur global analysis of mountain forest loss identifies an alarming acceleration over the past two decades,\u201d the researchers, led by scientists from the University of Leeds and the Southern University of Science and Technology in China, wrote in the paper, published in the journal One Earth.They found that logging was responsible for 42% of mountain forest loss, wildfires for 29%, slash-and-burn cultivation 15% and semi-permanent or permanent agriculture 10%.The researchers tracked changes in forests between 2001 and 2018, documenting both increases and decreases in tree cover, and working out possible impacts on biodiversity. They found that Asia, South America, Africa, Europe and Australia were all badly affected. Much of the loss in northern Asia was due to wildfires, especially in large parts of Russia. Droughts and bushfires led to significant losses in Australia.The annual rate of loss rose sharply after 2010, increasing by 50% in 2010-2018 compared with 2001-2009. Expansion of agriculture and logging in the highland areas of south-east Asia was found to be a key driver. During the period of study, more than half of global forest loss happened in Asia.The climate crisis is putting pressure on specialist \u2013 and often sensitive \u2013 mountain wildlife, as warmer temperatures force species to move to higher ground. At some point, they are likely to run out of suitable habitats, a process known as the \u201cescalator to extinction\u201d.Previous studies have shown that alpine plants are not keeping up with climate breakdown, with invasive species colonising the tops of mountains faster. Botanists working in the Scottish Highlands also found Britain\u2019s rarest mountain plants were retreating higher.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Zhenzhong Zeng from Southern University of Science and Technology, one of the paper\u2019s authors, said: \u201cWhat needs our attention is that mountain forest loss has encroached on areas of known high conservation value to terrestrial biodiversity, especially in the tropics. Various types of agriculture expansion and forestry activities are key drivers there.\u201dThe paper found that creating protected areas within biodiversity hotspots lowered the rate of loss. \u201cIncreasing the area of protection in mountains should be central to preserving montane forests and biodiversity in the future,\u201d it said.Dr Marco Mina, a researcher at the Institute for Alpine Environment, Eurac Research, in Italy, who was not involved in the study, said: \u201cMy overall opinion is that the use of large-scale data such as remote-sensing satellite products are a great tool to monitor forest change in almost real time. However, we should be cautious to draw global conclusions based solely on remote-sensing products.\u201cA forest that is well managed through a careful planning process can still provide high levels of habitat for plants and animal species.\u201d The headline of this article was amended on 20 March 2023 to remove a reference to \u201calpine\u201d wildlife.

        "text": "The tiny Caribbean island of Dominica is creating the world\u2019s first marine protected area for one of Earth\u2019s largest animals: the endangered sperm whale.Nearly 300 sq miles (800 sq km) of royal blue waters on the western side of the island nation that serve as key nursing and feeding grounds will be designated as a reserve, the government announced on Monday.\u201cWe want to ensure these majestic and highly intelligent animals are safe from harm and continue keeping our waters and our climate healthy,\u201d the prime minister of Dominica, Roosevelt Skerrit, said in a statement.Dominica\u2019s mountain chicken frog faces disappearance in \u2018fastest track to extinction ever recorded\u2019Read moreScientists say the reserve not only will protect the animals, but it will also help fight the climate crisis.Sperm whales defecate near the surface because they shut down non-vital functions when they dive to depths of up to 10,000ft (3,000 meters). As a result, nutrient-rich poop remains along the ocean surface and creates plankton blooms, which capture carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and drag it to the ocean floor when they die. And sperm whales in Dominica are believed to defecate more than whales elsewhere, said Shane Gero, a whale biologist and founder of the Dominica Sperm Whale Project, a research program focused on sperm whales in the eastern Caribbean.It is unclear why sperm whales seem to defecate more in Dominica. Gero said it could be they are eating twice as much, or maybe there is something particular about the type of squid they are eating.\u201cIn some respects, sperm whales are fighting climate change on our behalf,\u201d Gero said in an interview.Fewer than 500 sperm whales are estimated to live in the waters surrounding Dominica, part of a population that moves along the Lesser Antilles chain, swimming as far south as St Vincent and north into Guadeloupe. Unlike sperm whales elsewhere in the world, the ones around the eastern Caribbean do not travel very far, Gero said.He noted that sperm whales are a matrilineal society, with young males leaving and switching oceans at some point in their lives. As a result, protecting the species is key, especially if few female calves are born, he said.\u201cOne calf being entangled can mean the end of a family,\u201d he said.Sperm whales can produce a single calf every five to seven years.In waters around Dominica and elsewhere, sperm whales have been hit by ships, entangled in fishing gear and affected by agricultural runoff, limiting their survival. In the pre-whaling days, an estimated 2 million sperm whales roamed the Earth\u2019s deep waters before they were hunted for oil used to burn lamps and lubricate machinery. Now, some 800,000 are left, Gero said.The government of Dominica said the reserve would allow sustainable artisanal fishing and delineate an international shipping lane to avoid more deaths of sperm whales, which have the largest brain of an animal species in the world and can grow up to 50ft (15 meters).Once the reserve is created, the prime minister said his administration will appoint an officer and observers to ensure the area is respected and that whale tourism regulations are enforced. Visitors can still swim with sperm whales and see them from a boat, but in limited numbers.The move was praised by scientists and conservationists including Enric Sala, an explorer-in-residence at National Geographic.\u201cThe government of Dominica has realized that the sperm whales, which were probably here before humans, are also citizens of Dominica,\u201d he said. \u201cThese whales will spend most of the year offshore the island. So, they are taking care of some of their citizens in a way that few nations have ever done before.\u201dAn estimated 35 families of sperm whales spend most of their time in waters surrounding Dominica. Gero said some are probably more than 60 years old, and they communicate via clicking sounds in a vocalization known as codas.\u201cThat\u2019s kind of like asking, \u2018I\u2019m from Dominica, are you?\u2019\u201d Gero said. \u201cIt\u2019s a symbolic marker.\u201d",

Varma was hiking with a party of six people and about halfway through their walk through the inner canyon, the lowest part of the hike, he became unresponsive.

Each section has a unique elevation, temperature and landscape, making the hike incredibly rigorous and dangerous for people who are unprepared or haven\u2019t done physical conditioning first.While it is unclear what Varma\u2019s exact cause of death was, Baird emphasized the rigorous nature of the hike combined with the recent heatwaves makes it a dangerous time to attempt such an undertaking.

        "text": "European countries must bridge the vast \u201cplanning gap\u201d between their climate targets and action plans, according to a report.The national energy and climate plans (NECPs) that EU member states made in 2019 are outdated, lack key details and do not line up with long-term strategies, according to analysis from the environmental nonprofit organisation Clean Air Task Force. Only half of the states have submitted a fresh proposal two months after an EU deadline for draft plans passed in June.\u201cThree decades is a very short period to plan, permit, and construct the power system that we need in 2050,\u201d said Alejandra Mu\u00f1oz Casta\u00f1er from CATF, lead author of the report. Governments have a \u201cone-time opportunity to really take their planning endeavours more seriously, which they haven\u2019t done in the past\u201d.The report calls on member states to use their action plans to support a wider range of clean technologies, send clearer signals to investors of where to put their money, and plan cross-border infrastructure like electricity pylons and hydrogen pipelines.It also calls for a greater focus on solving practical problems like training enough workers and making it easier to get permits for clean energy projects.A spokesperson for the European Commission said it was working closely with the member states to ensure timely submission of their plans, and will issue an assessment of them by the end of the year.The EU has promised to cut greenhouse gas pollution by at least 55% from 1990 levels by the end of the decade and hit net zero emissions by 2050. But a report from the European court of auditors in June found \u201clittle indication that actions to achieve 2030 climate and energy targets will be sufficient\u201d.The commission has said that NECPs, which outline how governments will meet their energy and climate goals, are \u201ccrucial for mobilising the massive investment needed\u201d for climate neutrality and energy security. The last round of plans were written shortly before the Covid-19 pandemic and the EU\u2019s green-stringed recovery packages.Since then, Russia has invaded Ukraine, sending gas prices soaring and sparking a continental push to boost energy security, while the US has passed a landmark climate bill that has spurred a global race to support clean technologies.The EU has also overhauled its own climate goals. Since the last round of plans it has raised its 2030 targets for renewable energy from 32% to 42.5%, for energy efficiency improvement from 32.5% to 36%, and for carbon removal from land use from 225mtonnes to 310m tonnes.Setting ambitious targets is an important step, said Nicole Pavia, a clean energy analyst with CATF and co-author of the report, \u201cbut what we see countries, regions, member states and the EU as a whole struggle with is: How do we get from today to 2030?\u201dOnly a handful of countries met the EU deadline for the next round of NECPs at the end of June and as of mid-September just 15 of the 27 member states have submitted a draft.Among the laggards are Germany and France, the two biggest greenhouse gas polluters in Europe, as well as Poland, the fourth-biggest. Italy, Spain and the Netherlands have submitted updated plans, along with a dozen smaller polluters.Raphael Hanoteaux, a policy adviser at climate thinktank E3G, said the EU\u2019s rapid push for increased renewables and reduced consumption of fossil gas mean that \u201ctimely submission of these plans is paramount\u201d.Member states have also seen a shift in priorities at home. Germany, for instance, was ordered by its constitutional court in 2021 to update its climate law because of provisions that \u201cirreversibly offload major emission reduction burdens on to periods after 2030\u201d.In August, the German environment agency found that the country has closed 70-80% of the gap between its policies and targets, compared with what it was in 2021, but \u201cadditional measures are still needed\u201d to clean up its transport, buildings and industry sectors.Germany\u2019s last NECP \u201cwas more of a box ticking exercise,\u201d said Charly Heberer, an adviser on EU climate policy at nonprofit Germanwatch. \u201cWe would hope that the next NECP has been thought of a bit more holistically.\u201dIn central and eastern Europe, meanwhile, the last round of NECPs was \u201cpoorly implemented\u201d and not tied closely enough to EU funds that could have helped drive change, a report from the NGO Bankwatch found in June.The Clean Air Task Force report called on governments to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d beyond 2030 to 2040 and 2050, and better track progress to get there. The EU has not yet set a target for its greenhouse gas pollution in 2040 but plans to do so before elections in May 2024.Its scientific advisory board said in a report in June that the EU should aim for reductions of 90-95% by 2040 relative to the levels at which they were in 1990.",

Every hectare of kelp forest provides habitat for an average of about 900kg of harvested fish and seafood annually, the study says.Eger said when nitrogen washed into oceans from activities on the land, such as farming and industry, this could promote the rapid growth of microscopic algae that, when it died, depleted the waters of oxygen.But the world\u2019s kelp forests were absorbing vast amounts of nitrogen which, in turn, improved water quality and gave marine life habitats to live.\u201cThis is just a baseline study, so we expect the approximations will get more accurate as the field advances,\u201d Eger said.\u201cThere were also many other services we didn\u2019t assess, including tourism, educational and learning experiences, and kelp as a source of food, so we anticipate the actual value of kelp forests in the world to be higher.\u201dIn some areas, including northern Tasmania, Western Australia and northern California, losses of up to 95% of kelp have been recorded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Samanth Subramanian captures perfectly the vast scale and longevity of the effort needed to clean up Sellafield (The long read, 15 December). As Britain and other states with nuclear power industries grapple with how to go about an effective, safe and economical nuclear clean-up, it might be better to explain the challenges with less reliance on suggestions that in its early days the nuclear industry never thought about decommissioning (though the point has validity). Instead, we need more honesty about the fact that nuclear power inescapably generates large quantities of hazardous human-made waste, the worst of which will remain hazardous probably beyond Homo sapiens\u2019 time on the planet.The industry\u2019s solution to this is a network of deep disposal facilities. But none have yet been created, their cost is enormous and there is no certainty that they will perform the long-term task required of them. These are considerations that sadly receive little attention in current debates about the need for new nuclear-generation capacity.Coincidentally, you published a letter (14 December) suggesting that nuclear radiation is less dangerous than emissions from a wood-burning stove, a curious comparison to make. Wood-burning stoves are pollutants, no question, but they could never lead to a Windscale, Three Mile Island, Chornobyl or Fukushima. Nor will decommissioning them cost billions and take decades.Tom SmithChair, Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, 2017-20 In 1993, a government official told me that \u201cit was sometimes right to do the wrong thing\u201d. For reasons of political expediency, it was right to give political consent for the operation of the thermal oxide reprocessing plant (Thorp) at Sellafield. This huge facility, not mentioned in Samanth Subramanian\u2019s fine long read, had been built over the previous decade to reprocess British and foreign, especially Japanese, spent nuclear fuels. Abandoning it would be too embarrassing for the many politicians and their parties that had backed it, expensive in terms of compensation for broken contracts, and damaging to Britain\u2019s and the nuclear industry\u2019s international reputation.It was wrong to proceed, as the government well knew, because the primary justification for its construction \u2013 supply of plutonium for fast breeder reactors (FBRs) \u2013 had been swept away by the abandonment of FBRs in the 1980s (none were built anywhere). Because returning Thorp\u2019s separated plutonium and radwaste to Japan would be difficult and risky. Because decommissioning Thorp would become much more costly after its radioactive contamination. Because there was a known win-win solution, favoured by most utilities \u2013 store the spent fuel safely at Sellafield prior to its return to senders, avoiding the many troubles that lay ahead.Thorp operated fitfully until its closure in 2018. The 30 tonnes of plutonium that it separated remains at Sellafield \u2013 another waste to trouble generations to come. William Walker Edinburgh Anton van der Merwe makes the compelling point that lack of investment in nuclear power over the last 40 years has had a disastrous impact on carbon emissions and therefore has exacerbated the climate emergency (Letters, 14 December). However, in the same issue, the long read discusses plans for new nuclear without mentioning the huge beneficial impact that low-carbon nuclear will need to have if we are to avoid climate catastrophe. The report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on 1.5C temperature rises published in 2018 presented mitigation scenarios in which nuclear generation would grow on average 2.5 times from today\u2019s level by 2050. Without this, the chances of meeting climate targets are much reduced.Neil SmithSolihull, West Midlands Have an opinion on anything you\u2019ve read in the Guardian today?

Companies in heavily polluting industries, including steelmakers, are also looking to electrification to help them decarbonise.The Inflation Reduction Act introduced by the US president, Joe Biden, has encouraged investors to back renewable projects in America, while Europe is attempting to respond. There are fears that these efforts could be hampered by poor connections between where power is generated and where consumers live, as well as a logjam in hooking up to national grids.Renewable energy developers have repeatedly complained about their struggles to gain connections for their projects to the grid and accused the government of lacking vision. In the UK, some projects face waits of up to 15 years, and National Grid is attempting to cut delays.The IEA said renewable projects offering at least 3,000 gigawatts of power were waiting for connections to their national grids \u2013 five times as much as the solar and wind capacity added globally in 2022.Birol told the Guardian: \u201cGovernments need to open their eyes \u2013 if we want clean electricity, we not only need clean electricity generation, but we need to build grids. It has been a blind spot of the clean energy transition programmes of governments.\u201dThere are also concerns over a decline in grid investment in \u201cemerging and developing economies, excluding China\u201d.The IEA warned that delays in grid investment and reforms would increase the reliance on gas, pushing up carbon emissions and putting a goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels \u201cout of reach\u201d. It said that the world\u2019s electricity use needed to grow 20% faster in the next decade than it did in the previous one to hit stated goals.The agency said governments needed to support the expansion of supply chains and extra training to upgrade grids, and planning systems needed to be improved.It recommended better coordination between planners of grid upgrades and renewable projects, improved processes to engage with the public on planning, and the increased use of digital tools to counter intermittency, when renewable power supply does not match demand.In the UK, National Grid last year laid out plans for a \u00a354bn upgrade of the electricity network to accommodate the growth in the offshore wind industry, the biggest investment since the 1960s. However, last month\u2019s failed energy auction saw no new offshore windfarms secure contracts, prompting criticism of Rishi Sunak\u2019s government.Birol last month warned that countries and companies planning to expand their fossil fuel production were taking \u201cvery unhealthy and unwise economic risks\u201d as their investments may not be profitable.Oil prices have since risen sharply in the fallout from the Israel-Hamas conflict, to more than $90 a barrel.

Ministers have set a goal for Britain to stop using coal altogether.However, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 led to countries boycotting Russian gas.

He said science fiction might become science fact given the rising population, the \u201cterrifying\u201d collapse in biodiversity and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s warning that runaway global heating must be tackled within 10 years.In a video segment filmed in Tanzania, Packham said he was often told while making wildlife documentaries that it was not his job to make statements of environmental fact, \u201cbecause that\u2019s news, that\u2019s something that\u2019s got to be reported by journalists\u201d. He said the recent UK general election had been marked by many journalists\u2019 failure to challenge lies.\u201cIf someone tells you it\u2019s sunny and someone else tells you it\u2019s raining, you don\u2019t quote them both, you look out of the bloody window and see whether it\u2019s sunny or raining and then you tell the truth about it,\u201d he said.\u201cAt this point in time, when it comes to environmental journalism, it is dangerous to lie because we have to tell the truth. Truth is the most essential component of progress.\u201dPackham added: \u201cFor most of the last 30 or 40 years we\u2019ve been making bits of the world look like paradise, absolute utopias. We go to places, there are never any people there, everything is functional, everything is beautiful. OK, we\u2019ve excited people, we\u2019ve fascinated people, we\u2019ve shown them things they could never, ever have dreamed of, and they have fallen in love with that environment through awe and wonder and affinity \u2013 but has their love actually transformed into making a real difference? No.\u201dPackham praised Blue Planet II for bringing plastic pollution to global attention and the One Show\u2019s campaign to raise awareness on the same issue. The BBC\u2019s Seven Worlds, One Planet contained some \u201chard-hitting stuff\u201d, he said.\u201cWe are starting to make these programmes and the BBC has a real commitment to make more,\u201d he told the Guardian before the speech, describing his Horizon documentary as \u201clike a smack in the face with a sledgehammer\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hardcore.

        "text": "A study shows that the impact of air pollution on GP and A&E workloads may be greater than previously thought. Put another way, improving air quality could ease pressure on the NHS.Researchers compared the timing of 114,930 GP and 9,878 A&E respiratory visits in Bradford with air pollution measured around the city. Polluted days were followed by increased health service use for breathing problems, with impacts persisting for more than 100 days.A third of GP and half of A&E respiratory visits were attributed to nitrogen dioxide that was above World Health Organization (WHO) daily guidelines. This pollutant mainly comes from diesel vehicles and was estimated to cost the NHS in Bradford about \u00a31.95m over the four-year study. There is also the hidden cost of time away from work and lost education, as well as the way that illness affects people\u2019s lives.Separate research in south London between 2009 and 2013 also found increases in GP visits and inhaler prescriptions in the days immediately after pollution peaks.Prof Rosie McEachan, the director of the NHS Born in Bradford research programme and co-author of the new study, said: \u201cThere is no safe level of air pollution. We need more ambitious city-wide policies: clean air or low-emission zones, greater regulation of industrial pollution, cheaper and more reliable public transport, and infrastructure to enable people to use greener ways to get around.\u201dThe size of the air pollution impact may be related to underlying health problems in the area. Long-term respiratory illness in Bradford is greater than the national average. Even before the cost-of-living crisis, 15% of homes were living in fuel poverty and 22% of children were below the poverty line.A separate study of more than 300,000 people across the UK found that people on lower incomes were more vulnerable to breathing problems from air pollution.McEachan added: \u201cLike other deprived cities in the UK, Bradford has high levels of respiratory illness. This is likely due to air pollution as many deprived urban areas are also pollution hotspots. High pollution events make these problems worse, with clear impacts on health service use.\u201dThe UK government\u2019s air quality information service would classify most of these pollution events as low.McEachan commented: \u201cUK air quality information systems should reflect the more stringent levels recently endorsed by the WHO. It is really important that the public understand the impact that dirty air has on their health.\u201dNew research from ISGlobal, the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, has quantified the impacts from different pollution sources to help local and national politicians to prioritise action. For Bradford nearly half the attributable deaths from nitrogen dioxide in 2015 were linked to traffic. Agriculture in the surrounding area is the top source for health impacts from particle pollution, but reducing pollution from transport, home heating and energy generation will help, too.Prof Mark Nieuwenhuijsen of ISGlobal said: \u201cIn this day and age, no one should die of air pollution in Europe. Bolder measures are required to drastically reduce pollution and deaths associated with traffic. At the same time, we need to tackle other sources including industry and shipping, along with limiting home wood burning and emissions from farming.\u201d",

In 2017, I moved to the city of Altamira in Par\u00e1, northern Brazil; it is the centre of the deforestation, forest fires and social devastation caused by the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam. I moved here because I no longer wanted to be just a \u201cspecial correspondent to the Amazon\u201d, but so I could describe what was happening to the largest tropical forest on the planet from the inside. Despite this long experience, 2022 was the first year in which I watched the forest burn from the window of my home. I didn\u2019t need to go to the fire, as journalists normally do. The fire had come to me.The photo I\u2019ve chosen, taken by my husband, is from the night of 27 August. Later, Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research revealed that it was the worst August for fires in the Amazon since 2010. Fires and deforestation rose considerably under Jair Bolsonaro who, this year, was narrowly defeated in the presidential election by Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, or Lula, as he is better known.Watching the forest burn from my window is, for me, like some kind of anti-metaphor. When Greta Thunberg said: \u201cOur house is on fire!\u201d, in the Amazon the image is literal. It already feels like a cliche to say we don\u2019t need to read scientific reports to understand the climate crisis, we just have to open our windows. International agencies list Brazil among the countries with the highest number of murders of environmental defenders, or of people killed in \u201cconflicts\u201d over land. For me, it is more than a statistic. I know people who have died, I have suffered with their families. And I reject the word \u201cconflict\u201d. \u201cMassacre\u201d would be more appropriate.The lack of difference between the metaphor and the literal demonstrates the need for an urgency that has unfortunately been lacking at climate summits and other global events. This is why calls for the UN\u2019s Cop summit to be held in the Amazon, on the forest floor, make complete sense. It is vital that negotiations advance at the speed the climate catastrophe demands. Knowing \u2013 from books, newspapers or scientific reports \u2013 is not the same as living. I know that, on a planet in a state of climate collapse, the real centres of the world are where life is found \u2013 not where the markets are.In the global climate negotiations, however, the markets still speak louder than the people who remain among nature. If we have any respect for future generations, it is time for the markets to be silenced and for nature to be heard. We will not escape the abyss that \u201cwe have dug with our own feet\u201d (as the Brazilian singer Cartola put it) with the same thinking that has brought us to that abyss. It is obvious, but the obvious has so far been ignored.What my image here doesn\u2019t communicate on its own is the pain. The forest is not an object and it is not only the trees that burn. The forest is a composition of living beings that exist in a constant state of exchange, in noisy conversation. Every time a tree dies, a world of non-human people burn along with her. I watched that fire and knew that no one would do anything for those who at that moment were suffering excruciating pain before their deaths. And the day after, there was silence. Silence, because this is the sound of the forest in death. This strengthens my conviction that in the 21st century, democracy will only make sense if it also includes the non-human species, from termites to primates, from fungi to corals.Capitalism, invented as we know and understand it in the country of the Guardian, has corroded the survival instinct of most of humanity.

They include polyethylene terephthalate (otherwise known as PET), polypropylene, polyethylene and polystyrene, all particles commonly found in synthetic fibers, clothing and textiles, as well as packaging and face masks.\u201cThis finding provides significant evidence of the presence of abundant MP\u2019s [microplastics] in clouds,\u201d the researchers stated in the paper published today in Environmental Science and Technology Letters.Earlier this year, a study out of Japan showed that microplastics were present at the peak of Mount Fuji and Mount Oyama, suggesting that the particles may have originated from plastics in the ocean and been transported via air masses. The concentration of microplastics in Mount Tai cloud water was up to 70 times that of Japan\u2019s mountains\u2019 cloud water.\u201cMost pollution we tend to think of is in liquid form,\u201d said Fay Couceiro, a professor of environmental pollution at the University of Portsmouth. \u201cWe tend to think of that going into the river and the sea. Whereas microplastics, because they are a physical particle, are not following the normal rules. We\u2019re finding microplastics in these pristine environments at the tops of these extremely hard-to-reach mountains.\u201dSo, how are they getting there?Other than contamination from people visiting these sites, the particles may be transported through the air. Samples from low-altitude and denser clouds had larger amounts of microplastics in them.Aged plastics \u2013 in other words, ones that have already been weathered from ultraviolet radiation \u2013 were smaller in size and had rougher surfaces. They also contained more lead, mercury and oxygen compared to pristine, untouched plastics. Scientists found that clouds can modify microplastics, possibly resulting in these particles affecting cloud formation.\u201cCloud formation has a huge implication for not just our local weather patterns, but for our global temperatures,\u201d said Couceiro, who was not involved in the study.Clouds affect the climate in a plethora of ways. They produce precipitation and snow, affecting global rainfall and vegetation. Clouds block sunlight, cooling the surface of the planet and providing shade on the ground. But they can also trap heat and humidity, subsequently warming the air.The study authors state that more research is needed to fully determine the impact of microplastics on the weather, but what remains clear is that more can be done to address this.\u201cThere\u2019s only one group of animals on this planet that use plastic, and that\u2019s us human beings,\u201d said Couceiro. \u201cWe really need a global response to this, as it\u2019s not going to be solved by a single country, because air doesn\u2019t respect boundaries.\u201d",

Conservation work had taken years, he added: \u201cNow we are starting to see the results.\u201dHe attributed the growth in numbers to stronger patrolling to stop poaching, as well as efforts to recover the numbers of animals that tigers hunt as prey, such as sambar deer.Thailand\u2019s tiger population was thought to be between 148 and 189 in 2022. Most of country\u2019s tigers live in Thungyai-Huai Kha Khaeng wildlife sanctuaries, the core area of the country\u2019s Western Forest Complex. However, there are signs that tiger populations elsewhere may be recovering, too.In December, the Department of National Parks released images from camera traps at Salak Phra wildlife sanctuary, in the south-east of the Western Forest Complex, showing a mother and her two cubs \u2013 the first time cubs have been spotted on camera in the area. Identification work by Panthera Thailand later found there were three cubs.\u201cThis is a big news for us,\u201d said Rattapan Pattanarangsan, the conservation programme manager at the NGO Panthera Thailand. Previously the location had attracted tigers that had been born in the core area of the forest and moved outwards, he said. \u201cBut now we are the source, we can produce tigers from our place. That means our place is safe enough, and has enough prey for the mothers to eat and breed.\u201dIn 10 years of monitoring, conservationists had not detected cubs born in the area, according to Panthera Thailand, which estimated the animals were about eight months old.According to the WWF, the global wild tiger populations may have reached 100,000 at the beginning of the 20th century. The numbers have plummeted as their range has been cut by 95% due to poaching and habitat destruction.In 2010, when the global population was estimated to be 3,200, 13 tiger-range countries, including Thailand, pledged to double the number of tigers by 2022.Progress has been mixed, and there are now an estimated 5,574, according to the Global Tiger Forum. India and Nepal have doubled their tiger populations, and numbers remain stable and increasing in Bangladesh and Bhutan respectively. Russia\u2019s population has increased, while China is also restoring numbers in some pockets, according to the forum.Thailand is one of the few countries in south-east Asia to make progress in rebuilding its tiger population. The animal is at risk of extinction in neighbouring Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.Rattapan said since anti-poaching work had been increased \u2013 including through the installation of poacher cameras, which in areas with phone signal can alert ranchers to poachers by sending a text message \u2013 this posed far less of a direct threat to tigers.Conservationists say reductions in other human activities, such as livestock raising, commercial bamboo collection and the hunting of tiger prey, have also enabled numbers to recover in Salak Phra wildlife sanctuary.However, threats to tigers remain, including from human encroachment and forest fires. The climate crisis was also a concern, though its impact was difficult to measure, Rattapan said.",

Temperature probes showed the water bathing the eggs ranged from 5C to 10C (40-50F), while less than a metre away it dropped to a frigid 1.6C.Revisiting individual nests, the team saw that rather than taking a decade or longer to hatch, as would happen in the very cold deep sea, baby octopuses emerge from their cosy nests after less than two years, dramatically boosting their chances of survival.A remotely controlled submersible filmed female pearl octopuses guarding their eggs in a warm-water vent two miles down and showed how they support other creatures such as anemones.

We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth \u2013 and how much there is to protect.\u00a0Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.All through the year, new adult females and males arrived. They were never seen feeding and were never joined by smaller octopuses, indicating that the site is used exclusively for mating and nesting.As with most octopuses, male pearl octopus die shortly after mating, while females try to hang on until their eggs hatch. Barry describes seeing sea anemones chewing on octopus carcasses.Discovered in the deep: the squid that sees both ways at onceRead moreThese and other scavengers \u2013 including fish, shrimp, sea stars and snails \u2013 form a thriving ecosystem sustained by the dead octopuses. A short way off, in similar areas of rocky seabed, animal life is far less dense.Mysteries remain, including how far the octopuses migrate to the nest sites and whether, like salmon, they return to the spot where they were born. Octopuses have a good sense of smell and may follow the scent plume drifting from so many of their dead relatives.Barry expects there are more deep-sea octopus nurseries to discover. But while this octopus garden is protected within the Monterey Bay national marine sanctuary, other sites may be vulnerable to trawling and deep-sea mining.\u201cIt\u2019s important that we consider the value of these little spots, and not indiscriminately wipe out areas of seabed,\u201d he says.",

The waste is now stored at Lucas Heights outside Sydney, and more than 100 institutions across the country.\u201cGiven the sensitivity of the project and the need for certainty of tenure that provides exclusive use of the site for the duration of the project, there appears to be no practical alternative to the extinguishment of native title,\u201d the submission said.But the government would need to provide \u201cbenefits\u201d in return, and be prepared for legal challenges. The submission also suggested a media strategy, saying that ruling out having intermediate waste (leaving just low-level waste) would \u201cdeprive the SA government of the argument the national repository was the thin end of the wedge, and that the government has a hidden agenda to site the national intermediate waste store in the state\u201d.The current government plan is to use the Napandee site as permanent storage for low-level waste, and temporary storage for intermediate-level waste (the long-term plan for the intermediate waste is not clear).skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These properties also mean it is especially vulnerable to pollution and changing environmental conditions.The State of the Baltic Sea 2023 report found that despite efforts to improve its environment, overall conditions had not improved while some indicators had worsened.Jannica Haldin, the deputy executive secretary of Helcom and coordinator of the report, said: \u201cThe findings serve as a sobering reminder that the Baltic Sea faces critical challenges stemming from human activities. The importance of transboundary cooperation, a shift towards genuinely environmentally sustainable practices and long-term commitment cannot be overstated.\u201dHuman activities including pollution, overfishing and habitat destruction had affected the ecosystem, leading to an overall decline in biodiversity, the report found.Eutrophication \u2013 a largely human-made phenomenon in which excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus cause algae blooms \u2013 was also a problem, it said.The Baltic\u2019s poor environmental status was also affecting the profitability of fisheries and tourism, the report found.There were some bright spots. Reductions in nutrient inputs and hazardous substances, as well as work on biodiversity and conservation, were found to have shown signs of success in some parts of the Baltic and several former pollution hotspots were removed from the latest assessment. The share of marine protected areas in the region was found to be increasing.But the climate crisis was increasingly taking its toll, the report said, resulting in reduced ice cover, more extreme weather and rising water temperatures.A Baltic Sea action plan, devised by Helcom in 2021, calls for strengthened biodiversity, a reduction in environmental pressures and an improvement in the overall health of the Baltic\u2019s ecosystem.\u201cStill, the current assessment results suggest that the recovery rate for biodiversity today is too slow,\u201d Haldin said. \u201cThe deteriorated status presented in this report is directly linked to the activities and priorities of us as a society.\u201dShe added: \u201cEnsuring that the Baltic Sea ecosystem maintains and improves its function is entirely dependent on how well we can manage our activities to ensure that they are truly sustainable and enhance the resilience of the ecosystem, both in the near future and long term.\u201d",

While his calculations show Earth has a 50% chance of setting that record this year, other models say there is as much as an 80% chance, he said.Scientists anticipate that 2024 will be even hotter than 2023, as an El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern \u2013 known for a tendency to boost global temperatures \u2013 will likely peak toward the end of this year.The last major El Ni\u00f1o, from 2014 to 2016, led to each of those years successively breaking the global temperature record, and 2016 is currently the Earth\u2019s hottest year ever recorded, Schmidt said.Experts at the meeting raised the alarm about the changes Earth is experiencing and said they are directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions, though they stopped short of naming the source of the majority of those emissions: fossil fuels.\u201cWhat we know from science is that human activity and principally greenhouse gas emissions are unavoidably causing the warming that we\u2019re seeing on our planet,\u201d said Calvin. \u201cThis is impacting people and ecosystems around the world.\u201dThe agency leaders touted its many climate-focused initiatives, which they said can help governments better mitigate the climate crisis and also prepare for its effects.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The plan is also opposed by Winchester council, and by the local Conservative MP, Steve Brine.UK Oil and Gas is also involved in a separate scheme to drill for oil and gas near an area of outstanding natural beauty in the Surrey Hills, which is likely to go ahead after campaigners lost a judicial review.Jeremy Hunt had previously expressed opposition to drilling at the Surrey Hills site, but as chancellor in Rishi Sunak\u2019s government, which has pledged to \u201cmax out\u201d UK fossil fuel reserves despite warnings from scientists and green groups, now declines to comment.The Lib Dems are hopeful of using local opposition to such schemes as part of efforts to unseat MPs in Surrey, and are heavily targeting Brine\u2019s constituency, held by the Conservatives in 2019 by less than 1,000 votes.Ed Davey (right) speaking to Paul Follows, a prospective Lib Dem candidate, at the planned drilling site in Dunsfold, in the Surrey Hills.

A program in New York offered tenants the chance to do just that and found striking differences in the levels of harmful indoor chemicals after the switch. \u2018I use it because it\u2019s better\u2019: why chefs are embracing the electric stoveRead moreThe pilot program took place in a 96-unit public housing building outfitted with gas stoves in the Bronx. Twenty low-income households participated, and at the beginning of the study half were given induction stoves, which use electricity to heat the cookware directly and don\u2019t emit pollutants.Researchers performed a controlled cooking test and found that the baseline level of nitrogen oxide (NO2) \u2013 which forms in the air from burning fossil fuels \u2013 in homes with gas stoves was 18 parts per billion (ppb).It rose to an average of 197ppb during cooking. That is almost twice the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) threshold for outdoor exposure deemed unhealthy for sensitive groups, such as people with respiratory illnesses, seniors and young children. Long-term exposure to NO2 can exacerbate asthma, lung disease and increase the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.(The EPA does not have standards for indoor air pollution, even though Americans on average spend 90% of their time indoors.)In the homes with induction stoves, by comparison, the background NO2 level of 11ppb saw a negligible change to 14ppb during cooking.Bronx resident Maria Leger with an induction stove. Photograph: We Act for Environmental JusticeOn average, households with gas stoves were exposed to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations 190% higher than those with induction stoves when cooking a meal. Over 10 months of air quality monitoring, households with induction stoves experienced a 35% drop in daily NO2 concentrations in their apartments.\u201cOne of our participants who has asthma said that when she would turn on the gas stove she would always start coughing,\u201d said Annie Carforo, a climate justice campaigns coordinator at We Act for Environmental Justice, a New York City advocacy group that spearheaded the pilot with Columbia University and Berkeley Air Monitoring Group. \u201cAnd she noticed that now with the induction stove, that doesn\u2019t happen. Her assumption is that it was the gas that was leading to that reaction and she does feel a sense of relief knowing when she turns her induction stove on she\u2019s not breathing in air pollutants that are exacerbating her asthma.\u201dIn the focus group conducted by Columbia University researchers, all participants said that one of their greatest fears around gas stoves was their homes catching fire due to a gas leak, a stove malfunction, or the gas not being turned off properly. Participants overwhelmingly preferred cooking with induction stoves and at the end of the study no one asked to return to gas. The entire building is scheduled to be fully electrified by the New York City housing authority, which also partnered in the pilot program.\u201cIntervention studies such as this one are important to determine the benefits of electrification, especially for people living in lower-income housing who are most at risk,\u201d said Rob Jackson, a professor of earth system science at Stanford University, who was not involved in the New York program.A recent study he co-authored revealed that gas stoves are constantly emitting methane, even when turned off. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised to see higher NO2 measured in homes cooking over gas stoves compared with induction stoves. I\u2019m also not surprised to see NO2 concentrations rise quickly above safe thresholds.

        "text": "\u201cBears are made of the same dust as we, and breathe the same winds and drink of the same waters.\u201d So wrote John Muir in his journal in 1871 after finding a dead bear in Yosemite \u2013 presumably Ursus arctos horribilis, a grizzly. If one considers the characteristics of the grizzly, this is quite a remarkable thing to write. We are not closely related to bears (their closest living relative is a seal), and grizzlies make for terrible company. And yet Muir was not alone in feeling that bears are somehow kin: we (or at least we in the west) tell stories about friendly bears; we fall asleep beside toys formed in their image; some have even tried to keep them as pets or live with them in the wild.This imagined kinship forms just one thread in Gloria Dickie\u2019s book Eight Bears. It\u2019s a family album of the remaining varieties of bear, but the book does more than its title suggests. Just like a good photography critic, Dickie is attuned to the person behind the camera: how we have framed bears over the centuries, enmeshing them in the stories that we tell about ourselves. As Dickie shows, bears are in deep trouble, and her book is a compelling attempt to see through their eyes: to explore what it means to be a bear in a warming world that is short on space.Spectacled, sloth, panda, moon, sun, American black, brown and polar bear: so wondrously varied are Dickie\u2019s subjects in physical form, character, diet, range and habitat that it is sometimes hard to fathom that they all belong to the same family. Were you to invite them all to dinner you would need an impossibly varied menu (salmon, seal, insects, bromeliads, bamboo, honey) and impractical seating arrangements (a sun bear may weigh 60lb; a grizzly, 600lb). The sun and spectacled bears, shy tree dwellers, might retire early, while others, notably the sloth bear, might dominate proceedings (sloth bears are prone to aggressive behaviour, possibly due to their precarious position in the food chain, just below India\u2019s leopards and tigers).Despite our fondness for bears, a vein of cruelty runs through human-ursid relations, and Dickie writes in painful detail about the ways in which we have turned them into entertainment or natural resources: Roman bloodbaths in which bears fought, sometimes reluctantly, against other wild animals or prisoners; bearbaiting, a popular pastime in medieval England, which was only banned by parliament in 1835; and bear \u201cdancing\u201d, a practice from which the Kalandar nomads of northern India historically made their living. In one chapter Dickie travels to Vietnam to learn about bear bile \u201charvesting\u201d, a practice that resembles a form of torture; Asiatic black and sun bears are held in cages, their bile extracted from punctured gall bladders (it is used in traditional medicine in some Asian countries to reduce inflammation and lower cholesterol).Although hideous, the destruction wrought by such practices pales in comparison to that caused by habitat loss and climate change. According to Dickie, only three bears \u2013 American black, brown and panda \u2013 may survive into the next century. Theirs is a future not just characterised by loss, but by uncanny changes in behaviour and biology: Dickie writes of black bears that no longer hibernate, pandas that cannot survive in the wild and \u201cpizzlies\u201d (the offspring of polar bears and grizzlies).The book is full of brave scientists and conservationists, but their acts seem dwarfed by the scale of these problems \u2013 problems that challenge the nature of human heroism and the utility of storytelling itself. Towards the end of the book one Canadian polar bear expert tells Dickie that it is \u201cvainglorious to study the natural history of polar bears\u201d given \u201chow much they are screwed up\u201d; to pause to admire the fur or claws of a bear is akin to lingering on a severed artery. Yet, thankfully for her readers, Dickie does pause to capture the majesty of these creatures as they navigate our crowded and warming world.

The net effect of that is more sunlight gets reflected back to space.\u201dThe result was a phenomenon akin to what\u2019s known as June gloom in the US, \u201cwhere you have very cold ocean conditions but very warm atmospheric conditions above this cloud layer \u2013 that\u2019s referred to as an inversion,\u201d Fasullo said.\u201cWinds carried these anomalous conditions into the deep tropics, and that instigated the feedbacks that are commonly associated with La Ni\u00f1a,\u201d he said. \u201cThe winds became stronger as a consequence of the surface cooling off, and then the flow going into the tropics was also drier, because a cold surface means you have less humidity in the atmosphere.\u201cBecause of that, the whole band of precipitation that usually exists in the tropics move northwards, and that\u2019s a critical component for getting a La Ni\u00f1a.\u201d\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nEast-to-west equatorial trade winds strengthen in the Pacific during a La Ni\u00f1a, increasing the chances of above-average rainfall in the spring and summer over much of Australia and south-east Asia.

But the recent [triple] La Ni\u00f1a \u2026 was preceded by weak El Ni\u00f1os in 2018 and 2019.\u201dHe added: \u201cIn 2020, the forecast for La Ni\u00f1a was not very reliable. It was not clear whether we were going to have a La Ni\u00f1a or not.\u201dIncorporating wildfires into ENSO prediction systems could be beneficial, Santoso said, adding: \u201cIt seems like it is only when we have really strong bushfires that the mechanism can work.\u201dThough the 2019-20 bushfires ejected smoke aerosols high into the stratosphere \u2013 the second layer in Earth\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 the 2020 La Ni\u00f1a resulted from interactions between smoke and clouds in the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere, Fasullo said.",

        "text": "For residents of Montpellier, the new year has brought new travel possibilities. Since just before Christmas, locals have been able to sign up for a free pass to the entire bus and tram network in France\u2019s seventh\u2011largest city. The majority of a population of 300,000 have, not surprisingly, taken up the offer. Yet the city council is not presenting this as largesse on its part. Rather, says its head of transport, Julie Fr\u00eache, it is making the change \u201cbecause mobility is a right\u201d.Slowly but surely, the dial on public transport policy across Europe is shifting. The pandemic \u2013 and the apparently long-term change to working patterns it triggered \u2013 has played a part, as has the cost of living crisis. Prior to both, the environmental need to rely less\u00a0on cars had already begun to chip away at longstanding assumptions about how we get around.In 2013, Tallinn, the Estonian capital, became the largest city in the world to introduce fare-free public transport, financed by the city\u2019s resident tax. Luxembourg\u2019s 640,000 citizens became entitled to the same in 2020. In France, the Observatory of Cities with Fare-Free Transport estimates that 43\u00a0towns and cities now offer at least some access without charge. In\u00a0Germany and\u00a0Austria, heavy public subsidies on tickets introduced during the cost of living crisis look as if they\u00a0are here to stay in modified form.In England, the sense of transport as a public good was lost amid the late 20th-century drive to privatise the bus and train networks \u2013 subsidising operators rather than passengers along the way. But even here, change is in the air. Liverpool city region is set to emulate Greater Manchester in moving to take buses back under public control. Following a public\u00a0consultation, West Yorkshire Combined Authority may follow suit. The widely adopted \u00a32\u00a0bus fare cap scheme, in place in England until the\u00a0end of this year, is further evidence of a changing zeitgeist. Removing it in 2025 would be a\u00a0deeply unpopular political move.For larger European cities, which are generally more heavily dependent on ticket revenue, a move\u00a0to totally fare-free services would be challenging in the short term. But for places like Montpellier, where fares generally finance a smaller proportion of the running costs of the transport network, it is both eminently doable and transformatory. In Dunkirk, where bus services have been funded by tax revenue since 2018, the result has been a boom in usage and perceived service quality, along with a widespread sense that the new system enhances the town\u2019s image.Such experiments and innovations have a particular relevance in the context of Covid and the cost of living crisis. But they should not merely be seen as a policy option in hard times. Flourishing and accessible public transport systems are an essential feature of sustainable 21st-century living. They are a means of social inclusion and wellbeing, helping to generate a sense of place and collective belonging.They are also politically smart. Various studies have pointed out that moves to restrict car usage achieve more reliable results in cutting congestion, carbon emissions and pollution. But the politics of the green transition needs pull as well as push factors to ensure popular consent and change lifelong habits, while inculcating new ones in young\u00a0people. Reconceiving public transport as a common good similar to health, education and other services can become part of the wider cultural\u00a0reset that is the task of our times.",

Either way, the levels will be very high.\u201dThe intense heat is expected to last for about two weeks in central and southern parts of Italy, while slightly subsiding in the north.Naming the anticyclone after Cerberus, the three-headed monster-dog that in Greek mythology guards the gates to the underworld, was not a coincidence, the meteorologist Stefano Rossi told La Stampa. Cerberus appears in Dante\u2019s Inferno, where it guards the third circle of hell.\u201cMetaphorically, the three heads indicate the three main climatic zones into which Italy will be divided,\u201d Rossi said, adding that humidity levels would be \u201cskyrocketing\u201d and that nighttime temperatures would not drop below 22C.A heatwave is also sweeping across France, Germany, Spain and Poland.In Spain, where the second heatwave of the summer could bring temperatures of up to 44C to some southern parts of the country, the Red Cross has urged people to take extra care and to check on those most vulnerable to the high temperatures, such as children and older people.It is calling on people to remember to stay hydrated, to avoid caffeine and alcohol, and to watch for signs of heatstroke, which can include vomiting, confusion, hot, dry skin and fainting.Spain\u2019s state meteorological office, Aemet, said temperatures on Monday could reach 38C across many parts of the Iberian peninsula, rising to 40C in southern areas and 44C in parts of the Guadalquivir valley.The heatwave, which is forecast to last until Wednesday, could bring temperatures of up to 43C to Mallorca and the Ebro valley on Tuesday.Searing temperatures were also expected to affect Greece where the Athens National Observatory forecast they would reach an average of between 42C and 43C as of Wednesday. The heatwave, the first this summer, is slated to peak on Friday, although forecasters predicted the extreme weather could trigger forest fires and be prolonged, \u201cinsidious and dangerous\u201d.In a rare step, the country\u2019s health, labour and citizens\u2019 protection ministries issued emergency warnings on Monday calling on employers to ensure staff did not work outdoors between noon and 5pm and advising older and more vulnerable people to remain hydrated, eat lightly and stay indoors.The City of Athens announced it would open special air-conditioned spaces to host citizens, in operation between 8am and 8pm from Tuesday. The Greek capital\u2019s large stray animal population will also be taken care of, with about 150 watering stations in place around the city. Greek scientists have taken the unprecedented step of naming and ranking heatwaves in a bid to better prepare policymakers and affected populations of the perils posed by the \u201cinvisible killers.\u201dHeatwave last summer killed 61,000 people in Europe, research findsRead moreResearch has found there were 61,672 heat-related deaths last summer, the hottest ever recorded in Europe.

Ice Fish Farm controls the Sey\u00f0isfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur fjord as well as three others in the east of the country, and aims to process 10m salmon each year.This industrial farming of salmon, Bj\u00f6rk claims, \u201chas already had a devastating effect on wildlife and the farmed fish are suffering in horrid health conditions.

The more we see these extreme weather events the harder it will be for the industry to justify a failure to act. Many claim that they want to be part of the fight against climate change but it\u2019s time that they show this,\u201d he said.Oil and gas companies spend about 2.5% of their capital on clean energy technologies such as renewables and electric vehicle charging, compared with 97.5% on traditional business areas, according to Birol.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We\u2019re saying to the UK government: \u2018How do we make sure that we don\u2019t fall behind?\u2019\u201dUncertainty over the Conservatives\u2019 plans for green power generation was making it more difficult for DS Smith to invest in new facilities in the UK, Roberts said. Packaging companies are recognised by the government as energy-intensive industries because they require large amounts of heat to reform recycled cardboard into new boxes. Demand for packaging has risen inexorably in recent years thanks in part to the boom in online deliveries.\u201cGoing forward, we have to decarbonise, but what are your plans? Where are they?\u201d he said of the government\u2019s energy policy. \u201cWe come to the UK and say: \u2018Can we just understand what is your policy?\u2019\u201dRoberts also said the government should extend the \u201csuper deduction\u201d, which is scheduled to end in April. The two-year tax break has allowed companies to offset 130% of investment spending on plant and machinery against profits.\u201cWhat can we do in two years?\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIf they said: \u2018We\u2019re going to do this over a 10-year period,\u2019 and actually stick to their word, then these things would help.\u201dThe Labour party, which has a large lead over the Conservatives in the polls, has said it will consider similar long-term tax breaks. Roberts said Labour should offer detailed guidance on its policy plans to industry.Bloomberg reported on Saturday night that Hunt would announce a temporary \u201cfull-expensing\u201d regime for corporation tax, to replace the super deduction. Full-expensing will let companies deduct the full cost of certain investments from their taxable profits in the year it was incurred, rather than spread over several years. The Treasury has estimated that it could cost \u00a311bn a year.Rishi Sunak\u2019s government has not so far signalled any intention to subsidise Britain\u2019s green industry on a similar scale to the US or EU, although it is thought to be considering some large investments in decarbonisation, such as a request for \u00a3500m to support a battery \u201cgigafactory\u201d, and \u00a3300m apiece to upgrade the UK\u2019s two steelworks with blast furnaces.However, the government on Thursday delayed one major infrastructure project, the HS2 rail line, because it wanted to spread the cost over a longer time period.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Water metering should be made compulsory for all households in England, the government is likely to be told this week, as water supplies come under pressure from increased demand and more frequent droughts and floods.Strain on the UK\u2019s water networks is increasing under the more extreme weather conditions generated by the climate crisis and, under increasing demand, investment by water companies has not kept up.No new large reservoirs have been constructed in England in at least 30 years, and leaks from pipes still amount to about a third of water wasted.Managing demand through metering is therefore unavoidable, a panel of independent experts convened by the government is likely to find.The National Infrastructure Commission will publish its comprehensive assessment of the UK\u2019s critical infrastructure, the first for five years, on Wednesday.Covering everything from energy and transport to water and waste, it is expected to find large gaps in investment and many areas in which the UK\u2019s existing infrastructure is poorly maintained and inadequate.The commission, set up under George Osborne when he was chancellor of the exchequer with the aim of advising government on vital investment, is also likely to warn that the UK is falling behind on the infrastructure needed to meet the legally binding goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and to protect against the probable impacts of the climate crisis.Many of the commission\u2019s findings are likely to be controversial, particularly in light of recent government announcements. The cancellation of the northern leg of HS2 has thrown out plans for public transport across the north of England, and delays to the phase-out of gas boilers have implications for gas use and energy needs for decades.Water is likely to be one of the most hotly contested issues. Sewage in rivers has provoked widespread public anger and, although few people have yet experienced problems with their water supply, that too is likely to start happening, as water supplies are not keeping pace with demand.Water companies have extracted about \u00a372bn in dividends since privatisation, but are asking for investment of about \u00a396bn to alleviate the sewage crisis and safeguard supplies. Most or all of that will have to come from billpayers under the current system.The commission is likely to find that up to nine new large reservoirs are needed, as well as enlargement of some existing reservoirs, and a plethora of water recycling plants. Nine new desalination plants could also be necessary.Increases in supply are unlikely to solve the problem on their own as the climate crisis gets worse and droughts and floods become more common across the UK. Managing demand will therefore be necessary, and compulsory water metering is viewed as the best means of achieving that.Water metering has been controversial in the past, as social campaigners have raised concerns over the impacts on large families on low incomes. However, water companies could be empowered to offer a range of tariffs that would mean large households, or households with special needs, could afford their bills.Water metering would also ensure that people on high incomes who use outsize quantities of water for leisure purposes were fairly charged.At present, people with large water usage, such as for big gardens or swimming pools \u2013 including the prime minister, Rishi Sunak \u2013 are able to use as much water as they wish, without having to install compulsory meters.Downing Street did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s question of whether Sunak had a water meter installed with his swimming pool at his home in North Yorkshire. The pool required an upgrade to the local electricity grid, with the cost paid by the prime minister, the Guardian revealed earlier this year.Government intervention will be required to install compulsory meters, as in many areas water companies lack the powers to install them, outside areas judged to be under water stress.A legally binding target is already in place to reduce water consumption by 20% a person by 2038, falling further by 2050, from about 145 litres a day to 110.The National Infrastructure Commission has hinted in the past that more water metering would be needed, though it has previously stopped short of making it an official recommendation.Sir John Armitt, chair of the commission, said as drought gathered pace last summer that he viewed water metering as a necessary step.",

Blocking new oil and gas fields is a sine qua non to realise that ambition. The Labour leader even went to the lion\u2019s den of Davos earlier this year to give business leaders that message.But judging from the headlines over the past few days, you might be forgiven for thinking that Sir Keir had never uttered a word about his plans. Or that Labour had not argued that a big public investment programme was needed to green the economy. The Conservative press instead said Labour\u2019s ideas were a \u201cgift to Putin\u201d; raised a \u201c\u00a328bn question\u201d; and were a sure sign that eco-friendly donors were being appeased. Such a tendentious reading of policy gives opportunistic bunkum a bad name.It is hard not to think that the reason for all the fuss is the imminent decision on the North Sea\u2019s biggest undeveloped oil and gas field, Rosebank. Rishi Sunak has drawn a clear political dividing line with Labour by saying it makes \u201cno sense\u201d not to invest in it. Yet this is the economics of the madhouse. Equinor, the majority Norwegian state-owned company behind Rosebank, made \u00a362bn last year. But it only has to lay out \u00a3350m to develop Rosebank because Mr Sunak will subsidise the venture to the tune of \u00a33.75bn. The jobs created are those of a fading industry, not a future one.There are dozens more offshore fields coming up for approval over the next four years. None should go ahead \u2013 with or without government handouts \u2013 because the carbon extracted would contribute to wrecking the planet. This is not about energy security. Fossil fuel prices are set on international markets \u2013 and any piped from the UK\u2019s continental shelf would not insulate the country from global shocks. Rather than attacking Labour, the current Tory party chair, Greg Hands, should remember he had made this very point last year. Neither would North Sea hydrocarbons reduce Britain\u2019s exposure to fickle markets over which petrostates and dictatorships attempt to exert control.The opposition\u2019s plans are more in tune with the government\u2019s expert advisers on the climate change committee who said last year: \u201cThe best way of reducing the UK\u2019s future exposure to these volatile prices is to cut fossil fuel consumption on the path to net zero \u2013 improving energy efficiency, shifting to a renewables-based power system and electrifying end uses in transport, industry and heating.\u201d Labour\u2019s \u201cGreen Prosperity Plan\u201d needs sharpening, not discarding. As the thinktank Common Wealth has shown, every aspect of the UK\u2019s energy system is privatised, which has led to structurally higher prices and a lack of state control over its development. Using public money to stoke a private investment boom won\u2019t guarantee a green transition, let alone a just one.That is why it is heartening that Labour is looking at government solutions again. The opposition plans an \u00a38bn green sovereign wealth fund that would take public stakes in clean investments as well as the creation of a publicly owned renewable energy producer called Great British Energy. Both see democratically controlled industrial policy, rather than a pro-corporate one, manage the transition from fossil fuels. There currently exists a chasm between the ecologically necessary and the politically possible. Sir Keir\u2019s policies attempt to bridge the gap, while the Tories are merely content with letting delusions rush in to fill it.",

It can disrupt activities that marine mammals need to survive, by shrinking their communication space, causing stress and displacing them from important habitats.Underwater noise from increasing ship traffic has doubled in intensity in the Arctic over the past six years, and is expected to at least double again over the next decade, as the ice melts and new shipping routes open due to the climate crisis.\u201cThe Inuit community on Mittimatalik has observed an increase in shipping and shipping noise, and harvesters are not seeing narwhals in their usual spots,\u201d said Lisa Koperqualuk, president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC). \u201cThey have to go further away to hunt them, which carries risks, costs more in fuel and affects the transfer of cultural knowledge.\u201dLocal children stand on the shore as the Coast Guard ship Des Groseilliers sits in the waters near the Arctic community of Pond Inlet, Nunavut Photograph: Reuters/AlamyThis week, the ICC, a body representing 180,000 Inuit in Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Chukotka in Russia, has urged the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) to adopt mandatory measures to reduce underwater shipping noise, which they fear is affecting marine mammals.Although the Inuit depend on shipping for essential goods and services, they want to ensure ships have a low impact on the Arctic environment, which is sensitive to underwater noise as well as other pollution, Koperqualuk said.A sign outside a cultural centre on Baffin Island.

The Inuit body wants mandatory guidelines, while Canada proposes a working group specifically to look at noise.The committee is also responsible for incorporating Indigenous knowledge into its work, enabling Inuit and Indigenous communities to engage in the process as well as exploring ways to increase uptake of the guidelines.Inuit groups and other NGOs say the voluntary nature of the guidelines mean there has been little progress on underwater shipping noise reduction.

He was well known in environmental health and housing circles for his work on regulatory reform of housing renewal assistance in 2002 and his drafting, in the early 1990s, of a consultation paper on the licensing of bedsits and other houses in multiple occupation.The proposals in his paper were blocked by the government at the time, but licensing eventually came into being with the Housing Act of 2004. Jeff was also involved, behind the scenes, in the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002, which introduced the concept of commonhold as an alternative to leasehold for flats and other properties.Born in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, the second son of Olive (nee Butts), a homemaker, and James, a local government officer, he went to Wintringham grammar school and then Manchester University, where he read economics. After graduating in 1970 he joined the civil service as an economist, later gaining an MSc at the London School of Economics in 1974, which he worked on part-time.He switched to work on policy and administration, ending up as a principal civil servant, although he could probably have gone higher were it not for his tendency to be outspoken and to vigorously defend his staff when he thought superiors were in the wrong.His first area of work at the DoE (and its successors) was on derelict land regeneration, and later he was at the Government Office for London, looking at policies to regenerate the East End. There was then a secondment to the London borough of Kingston, where he prepared a report on how tram systems could be provided in the area.Always a popular speaker at conferences for environmental health officers, he could be charmingly indiscreet and, unlike so many civil servants, did not always play a straight bat. He was also unusually keen to leave the office and meet those affected by decisions taken in Whitehall.Held in high regard by local government employees, who saw him as one of the good guys, he was a member of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health\u2019s Commission on Housing Renewal and Public Health until he took early retirement at 58.Afterwards he worked for Citizens Advice in Kingston for eight years, taking great pride in helping clients through the maze of local and national government bureaucracy, before spending time enjoying his allotment, walking, birdwatching and sampling good food and wine.Jeff is survived by his wife, Ann O\u2019Sullivan, whom he married in 2004, two children, Tessa and Adam, from his first marriage to Linda (nee Ross), which ended in divorce in 1995, and his brother Doug.",

Scientists think this stops eggs being smothered by detritus that floats down and settles in thick layers on the sea bed.   Photograph: Courtesy of William T White/CSIROA scientific survey 40 years ago collected one of these cases and for years it sat on a museum shelf. More recently, scientists examined it again and realised it was unlike any other shark eggs, with unique, T-shaped ridges running along its 5cm (2in) length.This finding sparked a shark egg hunt through museum collections, which eventually led to a new species being discovered. This is Apristurus ovicorrugatus \u2013 the ghost catshark with corrugated eggs.A lot of sharks give birth to live young, and some \u2013 including more than 40 species of ghost catsharks \u2013 lay eggs in which the pups gestate for as long as a year before wriggling out into the sea.When the unusual Western Australian egg case was first examined in 2011, scientists found a tiny embryo preserved inside and identified it as a ghost catshark.But they did not know which of a number of species it might be. They ruled out several Australian varieties that lay smooth egg cases, including the Pinocchio and bulldog catsharks, and narrowed it down to either a bighead or freckled catshark.In 2017, Will White, an ichthyologist with the Australian National Fish Collection, picked up the trail of the enigmatic fish. He and his team searched collections and found more ridged egg cases that had been caught in the same region off north-western Australia, as well as a preserved female catshark.Inside her body was an unborn egg case. They carefully took it out and saw it was a perfect match for the other ridged cases, proving this was the species they were looking for.\u201cWe were lucky in the end with this one that we managed to find all the pieces of the puzzle,\u201d says White.The half-metre-long female had previously been identified as a freckled ghost catshark. When White and the other researchers took a closer look they decided it was something new, partly because of the shining white irises in her cat-like, oval eyes.There\u2019s a lot of potential risk to the species, even though it might not be getting caught itselfWill White, ichthyologistThere are various ideas as to why these ghost catsharks evolved deeply ridged egg cases. \u201cIt\u2019s such a unique design and a very strong design,\u201d says White. The ridges are similar in shape to iron girders. \u201cIt definitely adds a lot of strength to the walls of those egg cases.\u201dThe ghost catsharks may have evolved this shape to evade predators. Sea snails are known to attack shark egg cases, drilling a hole then slurping out the contents. \u201cThere\u2019s no way a snail would be able to stick on to the surface of a ridged egg case,\u201d White says.An embryonic egg case showing the distinctive ridges.   Photograph: William T White/CSIROAs for their habit of laying eggs on tree-like corals, White thinks this probably prevents the eggs from getting buried in organic detritus, known as marine snow, which floats down into the deep sea and smothers the seabed.More than 5,000 new species discovered in Pacific deep-sea mining hotspotRead moreBut this puts the ghost catsharks at high risk from human activities that disturb seabed ecosystems, such as deep-sea trawling and mining.\u201cIf [trawling and mining are] wiping out all the corals, then there\u2019s a lot of potential risk to the species, even though it might not be getting caught itself,\u201d says White.",

Most of the cool-adapted moth species have declined in number in recent decades.One moth that has suffered is the garden tiger, whose numbers fell by an alarming 89% between 1968 and 2002. The caterpillars are adapted to survive long frosty winters.Scientists said these local extinctions occurred in the warmest parts of Britain, but that the threat to the moths was greatly reduced where annual rainfall was also high. While further research is needed as to why this is, researchers said it could be because the plants that the moths\u2019 caterpillars rely upon for food survive better when there is more rainfall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

All of these activities would retain water which would benefit moths and other wildlife.Dr Lisbeth Hordley, a postdoctoral researcher at Butterfly Conservation and lead author of the study, said: \u201cCold-adapted species, like the British moths in our study, are likely to be the first to struggle as the climate warms. Unfortunately, as climate change worsens, more areas in Britain will see the high temperatures that are driving these moths to extinction, so adapting land management to increase water retention is even more important to safeguard such species.\u201dAs the climate continues to change, the UK is becoming more susceptible to droughts, with a bout of dry weather last year causing record-breaking low rivers, which is continuing to have effects this year.Dr Richard Fox, head of science at Butterfly Conservation and co-author of the research, added: \u201cThanks to the efforts of thousands of volunteer moth recorders over the past 40 years, we now know that there is a strong link between warming temperatures and the decline of many species that live in cooler parts of Britain. Although that\u2019s really bad news for the insects, the records gathered by these citizen scientists have also shown how we can increase the resilience of these species, at the same time as benefiting people, by retaining more water in river catchments.\u201cExisting Butterfly Conservation projects such as the Bog Squad, which is re-wetting damaged peat bogs in Scotland, are already providing such benefits but much more is required to protect wildlife and people as the climate crisis grows.\u201d",

The category-four storms left corrugated iron roofs crumpled like leftover wrapping paper, flooded the streets with waste-ridden mud, cut residents off from water and electricity for several days, and sent many fleeing to hastily established evacuation centres.Devastation of this sort is becoming more common throughout the Pacific, where rising sea levels are leaving shorelines increasingly vulnerable to extreme weather made more intense by climate change.It is partly because of such crises that Vanuatu has introduced a resolution to the UN, co-sponsored by more than 100 other nations and set to be voted on this week, calling for the international court of justice (ICJ) to set out for the first time the obligations states have under international law to fight climate change, and specify any consequences they should face for inaction.The resolution emerged out of frustration with the mismatch between the global community\u2019s rhetoric and action on climate change, which routinely left Pacific activists and diplomats feeling \u201cvery disillusioned and disappointed\u201d, says Kevin Chand, the legal adviser to Vanuatu\u2019s mission to the United Nations.

By establishing international legal rules, however, they can be influential sources of pressure on judges and governments. Vanuatu hopes an advisory opinion that sets out stricter climate obligations would strengthen climate-related lawsuits around the world and empower vulnerable nations in international climate negotiations.Vanuatu already appears to have won majority support for its proposal, which is scheduled for a vote in the UN general assembly on Wednesday; 117 nations are co-sponsoring the draft resolution.The campaign to secure an advisory opinion began four years ago in a classroom at the Fijian campus of the University of the South Pacific, where several law students were debating how best to draw the plight of their Pacific homelands to global attention. After striking upon the idea of an advisory opinion, they began lobbying their governments to support it.Previous attempts by the Marshall Islands, Palau, and Bangladesh to seek an advisory opinion had stalled. But Pacific nations soon took up the law students\u2019 call. They gradually won support from other small nations in Africa and the Caribbean, then secured the backing of more ambitious developed nations.Vanuatu avoided singling out individual countries in its request to the ICJ, which has helped it draw support from large emitters like the UK and Australia. Other influential nations like the US and China have not yet expressed a public opinion on the proposal, but one person involved in the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity says both countries have indicated they would support it.The person believes that Vanuatu\u2019s campaign had been aided by the Pacific\u2019s growing geostrategic prominence as the US and China compete for influence in the region. \u201cPolitics in the Pacific is very charged at the moment. It\u2019s worked in our favour because it means that we have some leverage,\u201d they say. \u201cIt gives us some opportunity to make moves like this because the big players don\u2019t want to offend the Pacific Islands.\u201dMeanwhile, as these international debates play out, several thousand people in Vanuatu are still living in evacuation centres after the damage wreaked across their country by the twin cyclones. For them, advocates say, an advisory opinion strengthening the obligations on large emitters cannot come soon enough.\u201cExtreme weather events are becoming the new normal in our country as a result of climate change,\u201d says Odo Tevi, Vanuatu\u2019s ambassador to the UN. \u201cFor low-lying countries, it\u2019s an existential threat.\u201d Accordingly, says Tevi, \u201cWe need the global community to act.\u201d",

They blamed melting glaciers as well as the thawing of permafrost due to the climate crisis for the collapse, which occurred on Sunday and was captured on film by mountain rescuers training in the region.The witness video, which was published in the Tiroler Tageszeitung, showed scree and rocks hurtling towards the valley. Authorities said that no one was hurt.Police helicopters flew above the 2 sq km area affected, looking for people who might have been caught up in the avalanche but reported finding no evidence of anyone having come to harm.Last month the Swiss village of Brienz in Graub\u00fcnden had to be evacuated after its 50 residents were warned that similar conditions on the huge, 2m cubic metres of rock formations overlooking the community were in imminent danger of collapsing.Since the clearance of the village, a number of rocks, small and large, have broken off and fallen in the direction of the village. The Swiss tabloid Blick has erected a camera in the area to capture the drama via a livestream link, but experts say they have been unable to judge how much rock has so far fallen.Since Sunday\u2019s collapse of Fluchthorn, mountaineers have raised concerns about one of the most popular summits in the Allg\u00e4u Alps, the Hochvogel, which is just kilometres away in southern Germany.But authorities have said despite the fact it has been slowly disintegrating over several years, and a massive rock avalanche was a possibility, the danger of it collapsing was not thought to be imminent.If the mass of rock \u2013 estimated to be up to 260,000 cubic metres in size, which is showing visible cracks and fissures on its 2,592-metre high summit \u2013 were to fall, it would land in an uninhabited part of the area. At the most, inhabited areas would be affected by resulting clouds of dust, a spokesperson for the Oberallg\u00e4u district told local media.

Local attempts to \u201crewild\u201d the sea, such as the no-take zone established in 2008 in Lamlash Bay on Arran, have been successful, they add.But grassroots campaigners, usually at odds with each other over other issues, argued the plans \u2013 a key part of the Bute House agreement that brought the Scottish Greens into government with the SNP in 2021 \u2013 would devastate island cultures, in particular. The Scottish government also faced cross-sector criticism of the policy as poorly evidenced and dismissive of local experience.The plans exposed significant tensions within the SNP, in particular over the influence of its Green governing partners on controversial policy and a Holyrood vote on the subject resulting in the first backbench rebellion since Humza Yousaf became first minister.Responding to McAllan\u2019s statement, the Scottish Greens coastal communities spokesperson, Ariane Burgess, accused opposition parties of trying to \u201cweaponise the nature emergency\u201d and welcomed the commitment to \u201ccommunity-led input\u201d.The former SNP leadership contender Kate Forbes, who rebelled against her government on the issue, said the announcement would \u201ccome as an immense relief to those who understood the risk to coastal communities from the very beginning\u201d.\u201cIt is now critical that any new proposals for marine protected areas take into account communities\u2019 views, fishermen\u2019s lived experiences and the importance of a truly just transition,\u201d she said.Phil Taylor, the director of the conservation charity Open Seas, who previously spoke of \u201ccomplete entrenchment\u201d over the proposals, said: \u201cThe Scottish government are now learning an important lesson that deep community engagement and participation is fundamental to effective environmental action.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But even if it reaches that target, it would still take the company more than 340 years to capture the carbon it produces between now and 2030.Noronha Gant said: \u201cCarbon capture is a dangerous red herring, and Al Jaber need to look no further than his own oil company for proof.\u201dCampaigners are concerned that Al Jaber is going to use the Cop28, which starts next month in the United Arab Emirates, to promote technical solutions instead of pushing for large and rapid reductions in fossil fuel production and emissions.In May this year he said: \u201cIf we are serious about curbing industrial emissions, we need to get serious about carbon capture technologies.\u201dEarlier this year, the Guardian revealed that the United Arab Emirates has the third biggest expansion plans for oil and gas in the world \u2013 surpassed only by Saudi Arabia and Qatar.And as the climate crisis accelerates, with 2023 on course to be the hottest year on record, there has been widespread criticism of UAE as the host nation for Cop28 and of Al Jaber as president.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

With dung beetles, couples start rolling their dung balls with no idea where they will stop.\u201cIt\u2019s the first species that\u2019s been recorded that can coordinate transport in this way,\u201d said Dr Claudia Tocco, who studies animal behaviour at Lund University in Sweden. \u201cThey don\u2019t know where they are going, but they can still coordinate to move the object together.\u201dTocco investigated South African spider dung beetles in the hope of learning what pairing-up achieved. In other species of dung beetle that roll balls in pairs, females catch a ride by clinging to balls of dung, or walk behind their ball-rolling male.She gave dung beetles access to cow dung and compared how well single beetles and mating pairs rolled the balls when obstacles of different heights blocked their path. The particular species live in forests and face constant obstructions in the shape of plants and rocks. They bury the balls for food or to lay eggs in.The researcher found that male beetles always took the role of dung ball dragger, grabbing the ball with their front legs as they walked backwards. Females always helped from behind, walking backwards with their rear legs up on the ball.On flat ground, pairs of beetles rolled no faster than single males, but faced with hurdles, the couples surged ahead. When challenged by walls up to 9cm tall, males started to climb and drag the ball up, as females worked themselves into a headstand and pushed with their legs to help the ball off the ground. The females then held on to the ball as the male pulled it up \u2013 lifting about 10 times his body weight.At times, males clung to walls with only one claw and females repeatedly saved them from falls when they lost grip, the scientists wrote in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Pairs of beetles were faster than single ones and more efficient over obstacles, which would be \u201cextremely beneficial\u201d in the forest, the authors noted.But while pairing up makes sense, how the beetles coordinate their actions remains a mystery. \u201cHow does a beetle with a brain smaller than a grain of rice communicate?

Speaking at a press conference during a short visit to the Cop28 climate conference in Dubai, the prime minister insisted he had not faced any criticism from other world leaders for watering down his climate pledges.Claim: the UK has decarbonised faster than any major economyThis is true to an extent: according to some models, since the 1990s the UK has decarbonised faster than other large economies. This is because it was once very dependent on coal and was fast to phase it out. However, look at more recent times and the picture changes. Recent data shows Germany has cut greenhouse gas emissions faster than the UK since the 2015 Paris agreement to limit global warming. The UK was good at moving past the age of coal but it is going to be difficult to keep up with countries that have less stringent planning rules on solar and wind, more nuclear power stations, and less leaky, better-insulated homes.Claim: the UK is one of the largest climate donorsAccording to Seek development, the UK is the world\u2019s 13th largest climate donor. As it is the sixth largest economy by GDP according to the World Bank, the UK could do better.Claim: the UK will meet its climate targets even with rollback on net zeroSunak claimed the UK would still be on track to meet its carbon targets despite the changes he announced. The government\u2019s own climate change committee has worked out that the changes will make this more difficult.Claim: rollback on heat pump and insulation pledges will save families thousands of poundsThis is debatable. While Sunak has brought forward some exemptions for the gas and oil boiler phase-out, there were always going to be exemptions for people who would find it difficult to heat their home any other way. No one was ever going to be forced to have a heat pump \u2013 they could heat their home by another method that did not involve a fossil-fuel boiler. And the insulation rules he scrapped were only for landlords, who were going to be made to ensure their tenants lived in a home they could heat affordably. So while this will save landlords thousands of pounds, it may end up costing renters more.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Encircled with gravestones that it seemed to be absorbing into its root system, the Hardy Tree acquired its name, and its celebrity, from a story that the poet and novelist Thomas Hardy, then a young architect\u2019s apprentice in a rapidly growing London, was personally responsible for stacking its trunk with stones cleared to make way for the expansion of the Midland railway line in the mid-1860s.By Hardy\u2019s time, the literary pedigree of Old St Pancras churchyard was well-established. It was the original resting place of the pioneering feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, whose daughter Mary Shelley was said to have gone there for secret trysts with her future husband, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. Hardy himself wrote of overseeing the exhumations. He was charged with turning up at unexpected times to ensure that the clerk of works was doing a respectful job and not simply dumping the bones, as had happened in previous cemetery clearances.What is missing is any evidence that Hardy had any direct involvement in the arrangement of the stones. Moreover, photographs of the churchyard, unearthed by an assiduous amateur historian, suggest that the current ash grew between 1926 and 1960, only later becoming known as the Hardy Tree. That it had no greater verifiable connection with the Victorian author than, say, Sherwood Forest\u2019s Major Oak had with Robin Hood, or Berkshire\u2019s Ankerwycke Yew had with the signing of the Magna Carta, hardly matters. By mere dint of their longevity, trees collect myths and become lightning rods for the historical imagination.The Ankerwycke Yew is the National Trust\u2019s oldest tree, believed to be up to 2,500 years old, and is also said to have witnessed Henry VIII\u2019s courtship of Anne Boleyn. The enduring fascination with Tudor history has ensured its protagonists more than their share of legendary trees, from Queen Mary\u2019s Thorn in St Andrews to the Queen Elizabeth Oak, which has been holding court on its side in Greenwich Park since falling over in 1991.Oaks and yews live for thousands of years; ashes survive for a few hundred if lucky. They are the opportunists of the arboreal world which, until the recent catastrophic arrival of ash dieback, have pushed their way up in the most unlikely of places, providing 5% of the UK\u2019s tree cover. This is what the Hardy ash appears to have done before it succumbed to a common fungal infection.The demise of an old tree is always sad. But perhaps the real story of the Hardy ash is that it wasn\u2019t special; it didn\u2019t witness the canoodlings of the Shelleys, fall in a freak storm or die in a scary, imported pandemic. The entanglement of root and stone reveals a history of nature and humanity competing and coexisting in a swiftly changing industrial landscape. In death, it has grown into its own urban myth.",

Greenhouse gas emissions from private aviation have increased by nearly a quarter since the pandemic, when flying of all types nearly ceased in many countries for an extended period.Will flying ever be green? \u2013 podcastRead moreThere were 5.3m private flights globally in 2022, according to the report compiled by the US Institute for Policy Studies thinktank and the Patriotic Millionaires US group, which is made up of wealthy individuals pushing for higher wealth taxes.Last year was the first time that private aviation surpassed its previous peak, which came in 2007, before the financial crisis of 2008-09 and global recession. Sales of pre-owned and new private jets are forecast to reach $34.6bn (\u00a327.6bn) this year, up from $34.1bn last year.Although private jet travel makes up only 4% of the global aviation market, it produces about 10 times as much greenhouse gas per passenger.Stephen Prince, the vice-chair of the Patriotic Millionaires, and founder of Card Marketing Services, said he was giving up his aircraft. \u201cFlying on a private jet is amazing, it\u2019s the best travel experience ever,\u201d he said. \u201cBut having read this report, I\u2019ve decided to sell my jet. It\u2019s virtually impossible to square any iota of concern about the environment and humanity with the supreme selfishness of jumping on a big jet all by myself. It\u2019s simply not right.\u201dIn the US, still the global leader in private and business jet travel, passengers on commercial flights are in effect subsidising private flying. Taxes on private aviation raised only 2% of the tax revenue that is the primary funding for the Federal Aviation Administration, which operates air traffic control, even though private jets accounted for 17% of the flights handled.Chuck Collins, co-author of the report, director of the programme on inequality and the common good, at the Institute for Policy Studies, said: \u201cPrivate jet travel by billionaires and the ultra wealthy imposes a tremendous cost on the rest of us. Not only do ordinary travellers and taxpayers subsidise the airspace for private jets, but the high flyers also contribute considerably more pollution than other passengers. If we can\u2019t ban private jets, we should at least tax them and require them to pay to offset their environmental damage and subsidies.\u201dThe Patriotic Millionaires group recommends a 10% tax on all purchases of second-hand private jets, and a 5% tax on new aircraft. This would have raised $2.6bn in tax last year, the report found. The group also wants at least a doubling of fuel taxes on private jet travel, compared with commercial aviation.Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter and founder of Tesla, who was outraged earlier this year when a tracker published details of his private jet activity, was named in the report as \u201cthe most active high flyer in the US\u201d. He bought a new jet, made an estimated 171 flights in 2022, including one that lasted only six minutes, and contributed to the consumption of more than 800,000 litres of jet fuel, and was responsible for more than 2,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.He would have paid $4m in private jet taxes last year, if the proposed tax increases were implemented.",

Wissing, of the liberal Free Democratic party (FDP), has been under fire over the transport sector\u2019s failure to meet carbon reduction targets.The original \u20ac9-a-month ticket scheme was put in place from June to the end of August last year to incentivise travellers to switch to greener forms of transport and give financial relief to consumers facing a cost of living crisis. With about half of Germany\u2019s adult population having taking part in the scheme that the government subsidised with \u20ac2.5bn, the ticket was as popular as it was inexpensive.Whether it had a significant positive impact on the environment has been questioned: most Germans used the \u20ac9 ticket to travel around the country for leisure, while there has been little statistical evidence showing that those who commute by car changed their transport routines in any meaningful way.The new ticket \u2013 being called \u201cGermany ticket\u201d by the government \u2013 is hence designed to be most attractive to people who commute in and out of larger cities, where old subscription-based discount schemes are mostly more expensive than \u20ac49 a month.The ticket, available in digital form via a smartphone app or as a chip card, will work on a subscription model that can be cancelled before the 10th day of each month, meaning it may still pay off as a one-off investment for some holidays or weekend trips.Long-distance coaches and trains such as those on the high-speed ICE network are not included in the scheme.Due to Germany\u2019s decentralised political system, tickets bought in different cities or regions will come with different rules and add-ons. In the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, people travelling on a \u20ac49 ticket can also take a bicycle and a dog no bigger than a cat on the train with them for free.In and around the southern city of Stuttgart, travellers can transfer their ticket subscription to friends, relatives or colleagues if they pay an additional \u20ac9.90. States such as Bavaria are offering discounts for students, trainees and those doing voluntary service, who will only have to pay \u20ac29 a month.",

In Europe, an established high pressure system in the south is currently trapping the region under a heat dome, and unusually high surface temperatures in the Mediterranean are helping to lock in the heat on land. With Cerberus, we have entered, according to the World Meteorological Organization, \u201cuncharted territory\u201d. As soon as this year or next year, say some scientists, global temperatures could breach the all-important 1.5C threshold prioritised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Loss of life, mass migration, crop losses and soaring food prices as a result of extreme weather are already a stark new reality. Worse is almost certainly to come.At an intuitive level, we know this. But faced with these colossal and immediate challenges, European politics is showing alarming signs of drift. The aftermath of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis, and the spectre of economic recession, are combining to drain momentum from net zero targets. Last week, a core piece of the European Union\u2019s green deal was only passed by the narrowest of margins, after being heavily watered down. In key areas for reaching climate neutrality, such as transport, lifestyles and agriculture, progress is too slow.In Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and elsewhere \u2013 as Gordon Brown has noted \u2013 the radical nationalist right is successfully turning the green agenda into a battleground for its culture wars. In Britain, it has become depressingly clear that the climate emergency is not a priority for Rishi Sunak. The Labour party has meanwhile revised the timetable of its potentially transformative \u00a328bn-a-year green transition plan.After so many IPCC reports, Cop summit communiques and political statements of intent, the idea that these heatwaves could be considered a wake-up call for Europe\u2019s governments and populations seems somewhat otiose. Cerberus and Charon are searing reminders that the climate emergency cannot be put on hold as other crises are addressed. Europe is heating faster than any other continent, but its politics is not keeping pace. Time really is running out; progressive politicians need to rediscover the courage of their convictions and a sense of urgency.",

Ofcom cannot allow these statements to go unchallenged and uninvestigated.\u201dInvestigative journalists at the climate website DeSmog scoured hours of online footage of GB News broadcasts hosted on YouTube, inspecting comments made on air by presenters listed on the channel\u2019s website. Six were excluded on the basis they were news anchors or reporters, and so unlikely to express opinions. Of the 31 remaining, 16 attacked climate action on air, while 10 challenged or rejected basic climate science.Summer 2022 brought a record-breaking heatwave, with temperatures in the UK passing 40C (104F) for the first time. The Met Office, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Weather Attribution service all concluded climate breakdown made the heatwave more likely.But when the Met Office warned high temperatures were linked to the climate crisis, the GB News presenter and sometime priest Calvin Robinson accused the official forecaster of \u201calarmism\u201d. \u201cManmade climate change, I don\u2019t buy it,\u201d he said on 16 July. \u201cBecause how much of an impact do we really make if we\u2019re talking about carbon levels?\u201dOn 21 July, the host Bev Turner called heatwave warnings \u201cfearmongering\u201d in order to \u201cfacilitate state control over your life\u201d. \u201cGreen issue propaganda\u201d was, she claimed, \u201cpart of a plan to register us all to a biometric ID and a social credit score system that\u2019ll tell you when you can and can\u2019t leave the house for the sake of the planet\u201d.The UK\u2019s target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 was met with similarly extreme criticism. On 5 November, Neil Oliver, whose monologues have become popular on social media, used his show to attack \u201cnet zero [and] the green agenda\u201d, which he claimed was part of \u201ca hellish potpourri of policies guaranteed to condemn hundreds of millions to death by poverty, death by starvation\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "It was never really in doubt. But the first week of Cop28, which ended with a rest day on Thursday, made one crucial fact impossible to ignore: the fossil fuel industry is not planning to go quietly. Far more of its lobbyists are in the UAE than have attended UN climate talks before. One analysis counted 2,456 of them \u2013 nearly four times the number\u00a0registered\u00a0last\u00a0year\u00a0in\u00a0Egypt.The battle is hotting up over what next week\u2019s report on progress towards the Paris goals, known as the global stocktake, will say. Fossil fuel interests \u2013 both corporate and national \u2013 are pushing hard to avoid references to the phase-out that would signal the end of their business model and vast profits. They don\u2019t want an energy transition that leads to their demise.Last week, the Guardian revealed that Sultan Al Jaber, who holds the Cop presidency and leads the UAE\u2019s state oil company, recently asserted that \u201cno science\u201d indicates that \u201ca phase-out of fossil fuel is what\u2019s going to achieve 1.5C\u201d. Forced on to the defensive, he later said that \u201cthe phase-down and phase-out of fossil fuel is inevitable\u201d. But it is the nations at Cop28 that will decide, and there is no guarantee that any such pledge will appear\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0final\u00a0text.One of the key battlegrounds at Cop28 is that of language: whether fossil fuels will be phased \u201cdown\u201d or \u201cout\u201d. The choice is either reducing carbon energy sources or getting rid of them entirely. The latter would be preferable, but there are many other battles\u00a0to\u00a0be won. There will be haggling over whether a transition to a cleaner future should see fossil fuels \u201cunabated\u201d, with greenhouse gas emissions released directly into the atmosphere, or \u201cabated\u201d, where carbon capture technology and carbon offsets reduce the harm caused. The latter have so far failed to deliver promised benefits, appearing more of a risk than a solution, in enabling the necessity of replacing fossil fuels to be ducked.Currently, not a single G20 country has policies in place that are consistent with the 1.5C target. Some, including the UK under Rishi Sunak, are moving in the wrong direction. Meanwhile, the former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres highlighted the unfinished business of financing a \u201cglobal business plan\u201d for decarbonisation. Climate change is eroding poor nations\u2019 development gains, and without cash to adapt, such gains will be unachievable in the future. Yet finance flows to developing countries, according to the UN, are roughly a tenth of the $340bn needed by 2030. Bitter divisions between developing and developed countries on this issue almost derailed\u00a0climate\u00a0talks\u00a0earlier this year.Climate scientists are increasingly desperate. This week, five authors of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports told the Guardian that they want the panel to have a voice on policy as well as the science underpinning it. The emissions-cutting process stewarded by Cop is failing. Although the rate of increase has fallen, overall emissions are still rising, with 2023 expected to set a new record. Perverse though it may seem, in one sense the strenuous efforts of fossil fuel interests to hijack the UN climate process could be seen as a sign of hope. The industry understands that it is under threat. Following through on that threat, by insisting on a just transition to a safer energy system, is the task facing governments and\u00a0the\u00a0societies they represent.",

It is no different to drying your laundry on a washing line \u2013 the thicker and the wetter the clothes, and the stiller or duller the weather, the longer it takes for them to dry.\u201dThe wet weather has also affected grain crops, with waterlogged soil making them harder to harvest.Cannon said: \u201cThis time of year is when farmers need to harvest winter wheat, which is used for either animal feed or for making biscuits or bread, but the quality of the grain can be seriously damaged if the ripe wheat crop remains in the field because it is too wet to harvest.\u201cGrain that remains unharvested in the field in wet weather can start to sprout and is more likely to develop mould, both of which can lead to it being rejected for bread-making, meaning the farmer then receives a lower price.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Kemi Badenoch, the UK\u2019s business and trade secretary, characterised the commitment from IFM as \u201ca very important investment for the UK\u2019s innovative energy and infrastructure sectors\u201d.IFM, which has approximately A$217bn under management as at 30 June 2023, says there are significant investment opportunities in Britain\u2019s energy transition because the country is providing a favourable investment climate.Deepa Bharadwaj, IFM\u2019s head of infrastructure Europe said: \u201cWe currently see significant deployment opportunities, particularly as part of the UK energy transition in areas such as offshore wind, solar, battery storage, renewable fuels, and pumped hydro.\u201dCop28: Australia to bring evidence it can meet 2030 climate target but pressure builds over fossil fuelsRead moreAs IFM expands its investment portfolio in the UK, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Investor Group on Climate Change and WWF Australia will issue a joint statement declaring that Australia risks being left behind in a global race for capital.The statement follows confirmation last week that taxpayers will underwrite the transformation of Australia\u2019s energy grid through a radical expansion of the capacity investment scheme. In the biggest climate and energy policy development in a decade, the government proposes to underwrite 32GW of new electricity, consisting of 9GW of storage and 23GW of variable renewable generation.The Albanese government has sustained faced pressure to respond to the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which includes A$560bn support for clean energy and has escalated global competition for climate-focused investment.The government is looking to expand its $2bn Hydrogen Headstart program and potentially apply that same model to other industries, as part of a response to the challenges posed by the IRA. The business and environmental groups say the Australian government needs to move quickly.\u201cThe United States of America and Europe to peers like Canada, have enacted substantial financial incentives and a variety of other supportive policies to drive their transitions, and these are unlocking even larger private investment,\u201d the groups say in the joint statement.\u201cGlobal capital, skills and supply chains are following the money. Without globally competitive, proportional and smartly targeted incentives of our own, designed to suit our economic strengths and values, Australia will be left behind.\u201dThe groups note the climate and energy policies implemented by Labor to date, but say much more is required, including higher investment, sector-by-sector decarbonisation plans, faster implementation and greater coordination of delivery of the policies driving emissions reductions across the economy.\u201cThere is a window of opportunity to unlock maximum global capital and foster the skills and supply chains we will need,\u201d the groups say. \u201cThe Australian government should act now with a comprehensive set of policy tools, including but not limited to financial and/or tax incentives, that are equal to the immense opportunities and risks confronting us.\u201dAustralia\u2019s climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, will this week make an annual climate change statement to parliament and release a new assessment by the Climate Change Authority of Australia\u2019s progress before travelling to the Cop28 summit in the United Arab Emirates.",

The pests were detected by a member of the public and were suspected to have been transported from south-east Queensland, where there is a widespread infestation.The invasive species can kill people and livestock as well as damage infrastructure and ecosystems. The National Fire Ant Eradication Program response to the detection included chemically eradicating the nests, baiting the surrounding area, using sniffer dogs to search for further nests and imposing strict limits on movement of farming materials within 5km of the site.At the time, the NSW minister for agriculture, Tara Moriarty, urged vigilance, encouraging the public to be part of surveillance efforts.What are fire ants, and what will happen if these tiny killers take hold across Australia?Read moreNew figures from the state government show the community has made 512 calls to the NSW biosecurity hotline, with all reports of suspected fire ants deemed negative.There have been 283 inspections by staff and detector dog teams since the detection and more than 1,200 drop-ins to the NSW government\u2019s fire ant information bus.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nA further part of the response was to genetically test the ants to determine whether they were linked to the existing infested area in south-east Queensland.Moriarty confirmed the results showed the ants were connected to the known outbreak, suggesting they had been transplanted to the site, possibly in a delivery of turf.\u201cAt the time of detection, all fire ant nests were destroyed by direct nest injection and surveillance activity focused on the immediate area to check for additional nests \u2013 none were detected,\u201d she said in a statement.\u201cThe NSW government is not resting after eradicating the fire ant nests found in South Murwillumbah in late November last year.\u201dReece Pianta of the Invasive Species Council cautioned the community had a way to go, with an outbreak only truly deemed eradicated when 24 months passed without further detections of Rifa.While the spread beyond containment lines in Queensland was \u201cnot great\u201d, it was being addressed effectively, he said.In December, he visited the site with Craig Huf, chair of the Far North Coast branch of the NSW Farmers Association.In addition to the positive genetic link to Queensland and a quick response by authorities and the community, Pianta said the terrain of the site was \u201cin our favour\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The estimates by researchers at the University of Oxford are conservative, and do not include external factors such as extreme heatwaves, which would come on top of this average increase.Prairie planting takes root in UK as gardeners battle drought and floodsRead moreNorway will also suffer one of the world\u2019s most dramatic increases in days that require cooling interventions, the study finds, with a 28% increase in days with uncomfortably hot temperatures if the world misses the 1.5C target. Eight of the 10 countries with the greatest relative increase in uncomfortably hot days are expected to be in northern Europe.Researchers said northern European countries had not prepared for sustainable cooling alternatives as homes become uncomfortably hot in the summer months and infrastructure struggles to cope above certain temperatures. Cooling measures needed to face these temperatures include making use of natural ventilation, external solar protection such as window shutters and fans.\u201cFor example, sustainable cooling barely has a mention in the UK\u2019s net zero strategy,\u201d said co-author Dr Radhika Khosla, an associate professor at Oxford\u2019s Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment and leader of the Oxford Martin programme on the future of cooling.She said air conditioning could add to the problem if the grid was not decarbonised and fossil fuels were used to cool homes: \u201cWithout adequate interventions to promote sustainable cooling we are likely to see a sharp increase in the use of energy guzzling systems like air conditioning, which could further increase emissions and lock us into a vicious cycle of burning fossil fuels to make us feel cooler while making the world outside hotter.\u201dCurrently, buildings in northern Europe are often made to trap heat in the cold seasons and can become swelteringly hot in summer. This needs to change if the world hits 2C of heating and the country faces a new, hotter climate.The co-lead author Dr Jesus Lizana said: \u201cIf we adapt the built environment in which we live, we won\u2019t need to increase air conditioning.

Our buildings are exclusively prepared for the cold seasons.\u201d00:03:14What you need to know about the 'extreme' heatwave hitting our oceans \u2013 video explainerThe best way to avoid having to take these measures is to keep the world to the 1.5C of heating pledge made in Paris in 2015, but the chances of this are vanishing as countries burn through more fossil fuels. If this does not happen, northern European countries that do not have cooling measures in place can expect large-scale disruption.The co-lead author Dr Nicole Miranda added: \u201cNorthern European countries will require large-scale adaptation to heat resilience quicker than other countries. Extreme heat can lead to dehydration, heat exhaustion and even death, especially in vulnerable populations.

The name Spathaspora domphillipsii sp nov is proposed for this novel species.\u201dThe paper was authored by 11 microbiologists working jointly from three universities in Minas Gerais state, Tocantins state, and Western Ontario, Canada.Phillips and Pereira were murdered in June last year while they were travelling down a river in the Javari Valley, near Brazil\u2019s border with Peru.Phillips, a former freelancer for the Guardian and the Washington Post, was working on a book about sustainable development in the Amazon and Pereira, a longtime advocate for indigenous rights, was with him as a guide and local activist.Four men are in jail accused of ordering or participating in the crime.Phillips and Pereira join a long list of famous people to have plants or animals named after them.

In March, millions of bony herring, which boomed during the floods, died in a fish kill that dwarfed the events of 2019.Menindee local Ross Files, who was born in the town in 1939, said fish kills were not regular events.\u201cWe never had a fish kill in the river until they started growing cotton in the catchment up north. It never happened,\u201d he said.Regulated part of Darling-Baaka River and site of mass fish killThe March fish kill is still being investigated by the chief scientist, but a possible cause could be that the millions of new bony herring that spawned during the floods became trapped at the upper weir and consumed all the oxygen in the water.The office of the NSW chief scientist has also been asked to investigate longer-term issues around management of the river system and future emergency responses.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Rural NetworkFree newsletterSubscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is certainly far too much single-use rubbish created, and manufacturers should be incentivised to produce less. Since they are motivated to seek the cheapest option (eg disposable versus returnable bottles), it is up to the government to create economic rules that favour \u201creduce, reuse, recycle\u201d.It should also review how disposal is funded. Costs are incurred when following the proper disposal route, and these can be considerable. This provides an incentive to fly-tip, and discourages the provision of bins (the owner/operator has to pay).Litter clearing is the other side of the coin. Public bodies, both local and national, need to give greater priority to this \u2013 look at the state of roadsides. The money for this has to come from somewhere and, in principle, should be raised when items are made and sold.Where I disagree with the author is in exculpating litterers. The decision to drop litter, whatever one\u2019s circumstances, is a personal choice; littering is not confined to those who are hard-up. The common characteristic of wilful litterers, rich or poor, is selfishness \u2013 \u201cmy convenience, grievance or whatever is all that matters\u201d. However, I agree that merely ranting against litter is unproductive, and if one doesn\u2019t like to see it, then one should get out there and help pick it up (I do). More power to Taheri for doing that.Peter JanesWest Harptree, Somerset I read with interest Leila Taheri\u2019s article about how much to blame those who litter. I help local litter volunteers and the amount of rubbish chucked out of car windows into the hedges and verges along my local lane is truly atrocious. The vast majority of the rubbish is made up of discarded glass and plastic bottles, and aluminium cans.When I lived in Germany, I never saw this kind of litter anywhere, and there was a good, simple reason. Germany has had an excellent deposit return scheme (DRS) and recycling system for over 25 years. All supermarkets have machines that take glass and plastic bottles and aluminium cans in return for a voucher that you redeem at the till. Even if somebody throws one of these items into a hedge, it wouldn\u2019t be there for long because every kid knows it\u2019s worth 25 cents.Environmental groups in Britain campaigned hard for two decades for something similar here, but the current government dragged its feet because it is in the pocket of the big drinks companies and supermarkets. In 2019, it finally announced that a DRS would go ahead; it then took two years for a consultation, then another two years to hear the outcome. Now, we hear that it won\u2019t be introduced until after the next election \u2013 and it won\u2019t even include glass bottles.All those who voted for the present government should admit their share of blame for the dismal state of our country.Edmund WoodGillingham, Dorset I organise our village litter pick and we are invariably disheartened by the amount of rubbish we find and do get angry about it, so when I read Leila Taheri\u2019s article, I thought it was the Guardian\u2019s April fool\u2019s joke two days late.

Residents can cross the reservoir serving Montevideo on foot. The capital has declared a water emergency, with officials warning that it is a matter of days before it runs dry. For months they have been eking out tap water supplies by adding brackish estuary water, telling pregnant women and people with serious health conditions not to drink it. Authorities have cut taxes on bottled water and are distributing it for free to the estimated one in seven people for whom it is unaffordable. Others are turning to wells.The main culprit is the worst drought in more than 70 years. Though Uruguay is naturally rich in water, rainfall is highly variable due to the impact of La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o weather patterns. The problems are exacerbated by global heating, which makes dry years drier and rainy years wetter, as well as increasing evaporation losses. Neighbouring Argentina is beset by shortages already. Many more countries around the world face similar challenges \u2013 or soon will.Climatic factors are only one part of this problem. Researchers and campaigners have been warning for years that the growing impact of export-led agriculture and forestry was unsustainable. Only a small proportion of Uruguay\u2019s water is used for human consumption. In 2019, rice, wood pulp, soy beans and meat \u2013 the main exports \u2013 used more than 50 times as much as went to drinking supplies. There is also anger about the construction of a new Google data centre, which critics say will use millions of litres of water a day, though officials say that the plans have been revised.Experts say that 2004\u2019s constitutional changes led to major improvements in what had been a hierarchical and fragmented water management system. But integration in planning has not been matched in implementation. Successive governments have failed to adequately invest in maintaining and overhauling infrastructure, perhaps in part because in previous droughts, rain arrived just as matters were getting really desperate: \u201cWe all fell asleep,\u201d admitted Jos\u00e9 Mujica, president from 2010 to 2015. But opposition from big business, as well as complacency, has played a significant role in the failure to establish a satisfactory long-term strategy.That will have to change if the country is to find lasting solutions. There is reason to be optimistic. The 2004 constitutional reforms, approved by more than 60% of the population in a referendum, also enshrined public management of water supplies, and were motivated in large part by the privatisation of drinking water and sanitation services. A coalition of civil society and political groups, the National Commission for the Defence of Water and Life, identified profit-driven water management and greed as a fundamental threat to the basic rights of citizens. This was a grassroots initiative that succeeded in the face of indifference from political leaders and the media \u2013 and outright opposition from business interests.In a country that has been ranked as the most democratic in the Americas, civil society could play an essential role in finding solutions again. The importance of access to clean water is a top priority for the public once more. Uruguay\u2019s crisis today is the future for more and more nations.

Healthy plants emitted clicks and pops, but the sounds came in far more rapid bursts when the plants were deprived of water or had their stems cut. The noises could be picked up 3-5 metres away.If plants are so intelligent, should we stop eating them? | Emma BeddingtonRead moreAt 40 to 80kHz, the sounds are too high-pitched for the human ear, which has an upper range of about 20kHz. But insects such as moths and small mammals including mice can detect such frequencies, raising the prospect that the noises might influence their behaviour.Writing in Cell, the scientists describe how the plants\u2019 sounds are as loud as human speech and are emitted more frequently after two days without water. The pops peak at day five or six and then subside as the plant dries up.On recording the sounds, the researchers trained an artificial intelligence algorithm to identify the plant and the cause of its stress from the popping noise alone. It was not 100% accurate, but demonstrates that the sounds contain information that might be useful to organisms in the environment, they say.There is no evidence the sounds are an attempt to communicate, any more than a log declares distress by crackling on a fire. But Hadany said the sounds might nonetheless be useful for nearby creatures, perhaps affecting which plants animals feed on or where insects lay their eggs. It is unclear what creates the sounds, but the authors suspect a process called cavitation, where water columns in dehydrated plant stems break down, generating air bubbles.Whether or not anything is listening to the sounds, Hadany says the discovery could make irrigation more efficient by using microphones alongside other sensors to detect when plants are short on water.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He\u2019s also been community glue, catalysing friendships (\u201cDid you see him?\u201d), ocean conservation efforts and joint purpose.The giant cuttlefish, native to Australia, is the world\u2019s largest variety of cuttlefish. Divers can find them all year round in Sydney but most of the time they are quiet and camouflaged. As winter approaches, breeding time is upon us. The males give their chromatophores a workout and put on a dazzling disco of coloured displays to attract females. Sometimes they even pretend to be females, so they can look less threatening and wait until a quiet moment to take their chances with the actual females. As far as underwater sights go, nothing beats watching two males compete for a female \u2013 colour, movement and living art. They are short-lived creatures, like their cousin the octopus. They usually only live for one or two years and may only have one breeding season to establish a genetic lineage.The winter cuttlefish season is eagerly anticipated in Sydney and the first sighting is always met with excitement. Location details are shared and photos enjoyed. It\u2019s a reason to talk to people and to jump into the cold ocean water. I\u2019ve had the pleasure of being with people as they\u2019ve had their first cuttlefish experience and it is always memorable and thrilling.

Stumpy the smooth stingray at Western Australia\u2019s Hamelin Bay was the friendliest ray in the bay, allowing himself to be stroked by children. Stumpy had no tail so posed no risk to humans. But Stumpy was killed by fishers in front of local children. At that time only empathy prevented smooth stingrays from being taken by spear or line. His death and the uproar that followed inspired significant new marine conservation laws which protect black and smooth stingrays along the West Australian coast. Once a wild animal attains a name and a following, it\u2019s easier to recognise its individual worth.For our cuttlefish friend Mr Fabulous, we will now grieve gently, recognising the old adage that \u201cnature is red in tooth and claw\u201d and hoping that he had a chance to pass on his spectacular genes earlier in the breeding season. We will start looking for new cuttlefish, and enjoy their unique beauty and vibrance. We will benefit from human relationships forged over animal sightings and precious images. We will understand that being able to spend time with animals prompts us to care about them and their habitats. And we will remember again how much animals and wildlife enhance human lives, just by allowing us to be a part of theirs.

And they\u2019re not kidding: according to specialists Challenge Boxes & Packaging, \u201cin the UK at Christmas time, we use a staggering 338,251 tonnes of cardboard packaging, 35,877 tonnes of plastic and 269,423 miles of wrapping paper\u201d.So when it comes to homemade gifts, the thing to remember is that new isn\u2019t always better. First, look at what you\u2019ve already got around \u2013 bits of fabric or reusable cotton cloths, say, can easily be turned into wrapping, Ahuja and Williams say, and you can \u201chave fun using different layers and colours\u201d. Newspaper or sheets torn from your, ahem, favourite supplement will also see you right. \u201cThe joy of that is they\u2019ll get a free recipe, too,\u201d says Sadhbh Moore, co-author, with Abi Aspen Glencross, of Sustainable Kitchen. And if you\u2019ve got any greaseproof paper to hand, twirl squares of the stuff around a tower of biscuits, for instance \u2013 \u201cMuch as you would with a bottle of wine,\u201d Moore explains \u2013 for a good plastic-free alternative to clingfilm although, granted, that does come with a single-use issue.Alternatively, Moore suggests repurposing paper bags from pastry purchases, especially if they have \u201cthat plastic film in the middle\u201d, which makes them ideal for homemade granola and biscuits, \u201cso you can see what\u2019s going on\u201d. The same goes for those tea boxes with windows; Moore then \u201ccollages over the branding\u201d (although that does take a bit more effort). If you are having a Blue Peter moment, however (or are looking to keep children entertained), Moore suggests making an origami box: \u201cI\u2019ve done this with children at the Story Garden in King\u2019s Cross, where we made gyoza and then made origami boxes to take them home in.\u201d This strategy could also be applied to homemade chocolates, Moore says, \u201cusing newspaper, old sugar paper, card or paper for the boxes \u2013 no Sellotape, no plastic\u201d.If your budget allows, avoid the pile-up altogether by \u201cmaking the packaging part of the gift\u201d, suggest Ahuja and Williams, whose reusable dabbas are \u201cversatile and make a wonderful present\u201d. The likes of chutney, jam and homemade booze (\u201cForaged sloe gin or walnut liqueur are fun to make,\u201d the pair say) should go into reused jars and bottles \u2013 just be sure to sterilise them first. And if you\u2019re worried about flavour contamination (when reusing an empty pickle jar for, say, jam or biscuits), Moore suggests \u201ccutting a disc of greaseproof paper and using it as a barrier between the potentially pickley lid and the contents\u201d.When it comes to securing your gifts, Ahuja and Williams swap tape (\u201cIt contains plastic\u201d) for string, although you could wrap gifts with cloth instead (\u201cIt\u2019s so simple to tie\u201d). Then, to make things more festive, decorate \u201cwith foraged items such as leaves, dehydrated citrus, dried flowers, seed heads and herb sprigs\u201d.

They live inside a tube with a feathery red plume sticking out of one end and a clump of roots at the other.Deep-sea scientists first identified them in 2002, growing like a shaggy carpet on a whale skeleton they encountered by chance, nearly 3,000 metres deep in Monterey Bay, California. A deep-diving robot brought up samples which revealed these were not plants but worms that eat bones, now officially called Osedax \u2013 the bone-devourers in Latin.Q&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world\u2019s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth \u2013 and how much there is to protect.\u00a0Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Once scientists knew how to look for them, the search for bone-eating worms \u2013 also known as zombie worms \u2013 began in earnest. Teams dragged dead, beached whales offshore and sank them into the deep. Landing devices deliver parcels of animal bones to the seabed \u2013 pigs, cows, turkeys \u2013 then retrieve them months or years later to see what has infested them.\u201cBasically, wherever we put bones, we find [the worms],\u201d says Greg Rouse from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, San Diego, and one of the team who found and described Osedax.More than 30 species from around the world have so far been found. There\u2019s the bone-eating snot flower, Osedax mucofloris, first found off Sweden. Osedax fenrisi was discovered near a hydrothermal vent at a depth of more than 2,000 metres in the Arctic, and named in 2020 after the Norse god Loki\u2019s son, Fenris the wolf.The bone-eating worm ranges in size from the length of a little finger to smaller than an eyelash. Those visible to the naked eye are usually females. Males are mostly tiny and don\u2019t eat bones. They live in \u201charems\u201d of tens or hundreds inside a female\u2019s mucous tube, and wait for her eggs to emerge so they can immediately fertilise them.All the energy these diminutive males get comes from their mothers via their egg yolks. Once they have run down that energy store, they die. \u201cWe called them kamikaze males,\u201d says Robert Vrijenhoek, retired evolutionary biologist from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, California, who was also part of the original Osedax-finding team.The bone-eating snot flower, Osedax mucofloris, seen in the water with feathery tendrils coming from its head and a clump of roots at the other end. Photograph: The Natural History Museum/AlamyOne species, Osedax priapus, does things differently. Rouse and his colleagues named it after the ancient Greek fertility god, as depicted in erotic frescoes. These males are a similar size to the females and have a long, extensible trunk which they use to reach across the bone.\u201cI call this roaming the bone,\u201d says Rouse. When they find females, these males deliver sperm stored inside their head.Discovered in the deep: the mini cities of hairy-chested Hoff crabsRead moreTo feed, Osedax etch holes in bones by producing acid in the same way that humans produce stomach acid. Palaeontologists, in a quest to discover when Osedax worms evolved, have found telltale holes punched in the fossilised bones of a 100-million-year-old plesiosaur, one of the giant marine reptiles that once roamed the ocean.Genetic studies back up the theory that Osedax have been around since at least the Cretaceous period, long before there were whale skeletons around to feast on.Despite all the new species being found, nobody has yet tracked down any Osedax larvae. It\u2019s not clear how the worms find bones. It is believed they may drift around until they locate a skeleton, perhaps guided by chemicals wafting through the water.Studies of Osedax DNA indicate that these worms live in huge, interconnected populations, possibly making stepping stones of whale skeletons and other large vertebrates stripped bare by scavengers. \u201cOsedax probably just hop, skip and jump all the way across the ocean,\u201d says Vrijenhoek.",

This view is backed by opinion polls, which show that 71% of the British public support moves that will lead to curtailment of the country\u2019s fossil fuel emissions.\u201cSunak is largely performing for a pretty specific constituency within his own party,\u201d said Prof Joe Smith, director of the Royal Geographical Society. \u201cIt is a weak tactic and the party will be punished for it because the demographics are clear. A large percentage of younger people of all political stripes are looking for purposeful action on climate change.\u201dThe climate war between government and environmentalists came to a head learlier this month when Greenpeace members draped Sunak\u2019s North Yorkshire house in black fabric to protest against his plan to \u201cmax out\u201d the UK\u2019s North Sea oil and gas reserves by issuing a new round of licences for intensive drilling. Activists scheduled the demonstration for while Sunak and family were on holiday in California and the house was empty.Similar stunts in the past saw the homes of David Cameron and John Prescott targeted by campaigners. However, Conservative reaction was far more aggressive on this occasion. Ministers told civil servants to cease all engagements with the group, a decision that limits government officials\u2019 ability to collaborate with environmentalists over issues such as deep-sea mining and marine protection zones.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has since kept a constant commentary on the government\u2019s environmental performance. There is absolutely no chance that any of the mainstream parties are going to walk away from that commitment. It is a really strong foundation for action.\u201dThe environment movement argues that the key issue is to make the most of that astonishingly powerful political commitment. \u201cAt the moment,\u201d said Smith, \u201cestablished green groups are looking a bit spooked by the very forthright behaviour of Extinction Rebellion and need to be more careful and focused about how they pursue their goals.\u201cIn any case, we should not be leaving the battle to reach net zero to the environmental movement. Researchers, business, the media and other cultural institutions should feel more ownership of the task of having a public conversation about how we build a better tomorrow.\u201dThe problem with giving publicity to Sunak\u2019s anti-green rhetoric is that it suggests deep divisions over green issues in this country. Smith added: \u201cI was profoundly pessimistic 30 years ago about the idea that we could win round a majority of the population to the idea that climate change was happening, was caused by humans and that action was badly needed. All of that has been achieved, however, and that is very encouraging.\u201d",

Over the same period, sand temperatures have increased by about 0.6C.In stark contrast, 2018 research found that at a similar latitude, on Raine Island in the northern Great Barrier Reef \u2013 the largest green turtle rookery in the world \u2013 warm nest temperatures had resulted in more than 99% of hatchlings being female.\u201cIt\u2019s likely that a male-producing site like the Conflict Islands is going to be critical to survival of the future nesting populations within the\u00a0Coral Sea,\u201d said Melissa Staines, the study\u2019s first author and a PhD student at the University of Queensland.Research has found that warming seas will probably threaten sea turtle survival even if the reptiles lay their eggs at cooler times of year to adapt to global heating. Photograph: Migration Media/WWFStaines said that the proportion of female hatchlings had increased in recent years but it was likely that sites with balanced sex ratios were rare.The researchers believe the discrepancy in turtle sex ratios between the Conflict Islands and Raine Island \u2013 which are about 850km apart in the Coral Sea \u2013 is likely because the island group has high rainfall and abundant shade, whereas Raine Island has no trees.\u201cAll of the islands within the [Conflict Islands] atoll are heavily shaded by tropical rainforests, pandanus palms and coconut palm trees,\u201d Staines said. \u201cProviding full shade throughout the day across most of the islands can really significantly keep that temperature nice and cool.\u201dThe study, published in the journal Global Change Biology, also suggests the islands \u201cwill also be moderately safe guarded against extreme feminisation in future decades\u201d, but projects that over the next 80 years 76% to 87% of future hatchlings may be female on average.00:01:25Scientists record world's largest hatching of baby turtles in South America \u2013 video\u201cFemale dominance in the next 80 years may still be quite adequate for that population,\u201d said Christine Madden Hof, the global marine turtle conservation lead at the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and a co-author of the paper.\u201cClimate change isn\u2019t impacting this population at a threatening stage right now.

        "text": "Schemes to promote cycling and walking condemned by some critics as controversial and unpopular actually appear to be welcomed by many voters, according to analysis of last month\u2019s election results in London.Examination of the London mayoral election on 6 May on a ward-level basis showed that votes for parties that support such projects tended to rise in areas where they had been introduced, while parties that opposed them were more likely to shed votes.The analysis was carried out by Julian Bell, who was the Labour leader of Ealing council in west London for 11 years until being replaced after last month\u2019s local elections. Under Bell\u2019s leadership, Ealing trialled several so-called low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), one of which has since been removed.The LTN scheme promotes walking and cycling by using planters or bollards to make some residential streets access-only for motor traffic, while allowing pedestrians and cyclists to use them as normal. While there is evidence the schemes can, over time, reduce the overall number of shorter car trips, some opponents claim they increase congestion by pushing through motor traffic on to a smaller number of streets.Bell\u2019s analysis showed that in five Ealing wards where LTNs had been created, campaigns against them by the Conservatives and local Liberal Democrats \u2013 including a specifically anti-LTN visit by the unsuccessful Tory mayoral hopeful Shaun Bailey \u2013 appeared to achieve little.While the overall Conservative mayoral vote across Ealing rose by 0.64 percentage points compared with the 2016 mayoral election, it fell across the five LTN-focused wards, as did support for the Lib Dems.Labour was strongly in favour of the schemes, both through the re-elected mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the local council. While the party\u2019s vote dropped in the five wards, it fell less than the borough-wide average, and it took the most first-preference votes in all of them.Across the wards, more than 50% of voters opted for Labour or the Greens, both which back LTNs. This effect was magnified when second-preference votes were included \u2013 the London mayoralty election uses a supplementary vote system, giving people a first and second choice.According to Bell\u2019s analysis, a similar pattern was seen in other areas where Conservatives campaigned against cycling and walking schemes.Across the west London borough of Hounslow as a whole, the Tory vote rose by 1.2 percentage points against 2016, while Labour\u2019s fell by more than 4 points. But in three wards in Chiswick, along the route of the new CS9 segregated track on Chiswick High Road, bitterly opposed by the local Tories and by Bailey personally, the Conservative vote dropped by between 10 and 12 percentage points, while Labour\u2019s vote in the wards rose by 4.4 points.It was a similar picture in Kensington, where the Conservative-run council removed a separated cycle lane on Kensington High Street just seven weeks after it was installed.Borough wide, the Conservative vote was down 11 points on 2016, with Labour up 2.2 points. But in the four wards covering Kensington High Street, Tory support dropped by an average of nearly 17 points, while Labour\u2019s was up 6.7 points.Writing for the Guardian about the research, Bell said: \u201cWhat does seem quite clear is that in a bad year for Labour, cycle schemes saved or won votes for us, not lost them. And that if there was any \u2018controversy\u2019, it worked largely in our favour.\u201d",

At between 200 metres and 1,000 metres below the surface, the twilight zone is home to a variety of organisms and animals, including specially adapted fish such as lantern sharks and kitefin sharks, which have huge eyes and glowing, bioluminescent skin.\u201cPenicillin is an antibiotic that originally came from a fungus called Penicillium so we might find something like that from these ocean fungi,\u201d said Fabio Favoretto, a postdoctoral scholar at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. The twilight zone is characterised by high pressure, a lack of light and cold temperatures, which presents an extreme environment \u201cwhere fungi might exhibit unique adaptations\u201d, he added. \u201cThat could potentially lead to the discovery of new species with unique biochemical properties.\u201dDeep-sea mining: why is interest growing and what are the risks?Read moreThe new ocean DNA catalogue, launched on Tuesday, contains more than 317m marine organism gene groups compiled from samples collected on voyages including the four-year Tara Oceans expedition which started in 2009, and the 2010 Malaspina Circumnavigation expedition.Advances in technology meant existing samples could provide much more data than before, while the process of cataloguing helped open new doors into the understudied ocean, said the marine biologist and the paper\u2019s lead author, Elisa Laiolo.The marine biotechnology sector, which relies on ocean organisms and their genes, is worth an estimated $6bn, a figure expected to almost double by 2032.Laiolo was surprised to see so many fungi living in the ocean\u2019s twilight zone. \u201cThere have been some indications of it [fungi abundance at this level] before, so this is another piece of the puzzle.\u201dAnother critical discovery made during the cataloguing process, said Carlos Duarte, a marine science professor and senior author of the study, was the role viruses played in boosting gene diversity. \u201cThe viruses insert themselves and move genes from one organism to another. That means viruses create genomic biodiversity and that accelerates their evolution.\u201dOne result of that acceleration, he said, were genes that had evolved to enable organisms to chew through plastic. \u201cThey can degrade synthetic polymers, derived from hydrocarbons, which are very recent as a pollutant in the ocean, showing that evolution happened in a few decades.\u201dThe catalogue also highlighted gaps in our understanding of the ocean floor, said Laiolo. \u201cIt is easier to sample the water than the ocean floor and what we underline in the paper is the need to increase studies targeting the seabed in the future.\u201dA Rosette sampler aboard the Hesp\u00e9rides, one of the two ships used for the Malaspina expedition in 2010. Data collected then has been included in the new catalogue. Photograph: Joan Costa/CSICDevelopments in supercomputing and sequencing technologies, she said, means more information can be gleaned from existing samples, at much lower costs.Despite the catalogue\u2019s benefits, Duarte said there were problems with marine gene ownership and sharing of the benefits, particularly with countries in the global south that lacked the same access to gene-sequencing and analytical supercomputing. \u201cCurrently, 10 nations own 90% of marine gene patents, the benefits are not being shared,\u201d he said.Changes to ownership rules are being made, however. \u201cSince October last year a new treaty came into force that says those that discover a marine gene, own it.\u201d said Duarte. \u201cBut they have to share the benefits. The problem is, it\u2019s not clear how that benefit sharing is going to work.\u201dThe catalogue\u2019s release was welcomed by marine scientists. Favoretto described it as a \u201cremarkable resource for biodiversity assessment and conservation efforts\u201d that would enable researchers to monitor changes in species distribution, particularly in relation to the impact of the climate crisis and human activities.",

However, since being appointed to cabinet he has remained quiet.A source close to Hunt said he could not comment on cases subject to judicial review as a government minister, but that his views on the project as a constituency MP are a matter of public record.After the decision, Hunt tweeted: \u201cI am bitterly disappointed to learn that the court of appeal has today refused permission for any further appeal against the Ukog planning consent for the Loxley gas well outside Dunsfold.

        "text": "The decision to release and burn five tanker cars of vinyl chloride and other chemicals at the site of a 38-car derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, just over three weeks ago unleashed a gigantic cloud full of particulates that enveloped surrounding neighborhoods and farms in Ohio and Pennsylvania.Trump is taking advantage of the Ohio disaster in a way that\u2019s eerily reminiscent of 2016 | Tayo BeroRead moreIt is well documented that burning chlorinated chemicals like vinyl chloride will generate dioxins. \u201cDioxin\u201d is the name given to a group of persistent, very toxic chemicals that share similar chemical structures. The most toxic form of dioxin is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin or TCDD. TCDD is more commonly recognized as the toxic contaminant found in Agent Orange and at Love Canal, New York and Times Beach, Missouri, both sites of two of the most tragic environmental catastrophes in US history.Dioxin is not deliberately manufactured. It is the unintended byproduct of industrial processes that use or burn chlorine. It is also produced when chemicals such as vinyl chloride are burned such as occurred in East Palestine.The organization I work for, the Center for Health, Environment & Justice, has worked with communities affected by dioxins for over 40 years. We have seen the impact of exposure to dioxins in communities from Love Canal and Times Beach to Pensacola, Florida. And now, we are asking, why isn\u2019t EPA testing for dioxins in East Palestine, Ohio? Are dioxins present in the soil downwind from the site of the accident?At a townhall meeting in East Palestine last week, people talked about what it was like when the black cloud reached their property. One person who lived 15 miles away described burned ash material from the fire that settled on her property. Another who lived 3 miles away described how the black cloud completely smothered his property. Repeatedly people asked: was it safe for my kids to play in the yard? Is it safe to grow a garden? What is going to happen to my farm animals?These are important questions that deserve to be answered. Today there are no clear answers. Why? Because no one has done any testing for dioxins anywhere in East Palestine. No one. And, it seems, that the EPA is uninterested in testing for dioxins, behaving as though dioxin is no big deal.This makes no sense. Testing for dioxin, a highly toxic substance, should have been one of the first things to look for, especially in the air once the decision was made to burn the vinyl chloride. There is no question that dioxins were formed in the vinyl chloride fire. They would have formed on the particulate matter \u2013 the black soot \u2013 in the cloud that was so clearly visible at the time of the burn. Now, the question is how much is in the soil where people live in and around East Palestine. Without testing, no one will know and the people who live there will remain in the dark, uncertain about their fate.This is important because of the adverse health effects associated with exposure to dioxins. Exposure to dioxins can cause cancer, reproductive damage, developmental problems, type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease, infertility in adults, impairment of the immune system and skin lesions.The EPA is very familiar with dioxins. For more than 25 years, the agency evaluated and assessed the risks posed by exposure to dioxins. They published multiple draft reports on the health effects caused by exposure to dioxins. They published an inventory of dioxin sources and devoted an enormous amount of time to studying dioxins. The agency knows this chemical very well.So why is EPA unwilling to test for dioxins in the soil? My guess is because they know they will find it. And if they find it, they\u2019ll have to address the many questions people are asking. It will not be easy to interpret the results of the testing for dioxins in soil, but to avoid testing is irresponsible. The EPA\u2019s mission is to protect human health and the environment. Clearly the situation in East Palestine is the place where EPA should follow its mission and do right by the people who live in this town. EPA must test the soil in East Palestine for dioxins.The people who live there need to know so they can make informed decisions about their future.\nStephen Lester is a toxicologist and the science director of the Center for Health, Environment & Justice, a project of the People\u2019s Action Institute\n",

Even today I find offerings tucked into holes in the quartz stone: a posy of red campion, gorse flowers, a rain-soaked handwritten letter, a lock of hair \u2013 gifts of hope and prayer. One theory is that the circle had links with the moon, with the number of stones referring to the metonic cycle, a lunisolar calendar in which the moon\u2019s phases recur at the same time every 19 years. Quartz, meanwhile, was thought to have been sacred during the bronze age, perhaps because it would shimmer beneath the moon\u2019s glow.Whether due to its historical value, its sense of mystery, or the way it connects the landscape, this place still holds a certain enchantment, further enhanced around the time of the solstice.We have slightly romanticised the idea of solstice. We see the midwinter as a time of peace and reflection, or one of celebration, but while archaeological discoveries have revealed that our ancestors did feast at the winter solstice, we also know that winter was a time of dread. The threat of death from cold or starvation was real, so their holding rituals and making sacrifices of animals or crops may have been attempts to barter their way safely through the darkest period of the year.I watch the shadows lengthen until darkness finally envelops the circle.

So, much as I hate turnips, I can\u2019t entirely disagree with Coffey here. Caroline McParlandGlasgow This is not the first time England has turned to turnips for sustenance. A run of disastrous grain harvests in the 1590s threatened Londoners with starvation. This was alleviated by roots \u2013 turnips, carrots and parsnips \u2013 grown by Protestant refugees from the low countries who settled initially in East Anglia and Kent, bringing with them expertise in commercial gardening.Roots were shipped to London from the East Anglian ports of Yarmouth, Colchester and Norwich in each of the three worst years of dearth. Nearer London, root production was developing; in the late 1590s, the herbalist John Gerard wrote: \u201cThe small Turnep groweth by Hackney, in a sandy ground, and those that are brought to Cheap-side market from that village are the best that ever I tasted.\u201d On the other side of London, roots were grown in quantity in Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea.By the 1630s, this area was said to furnish \u201cthe Cittys of London Westminster and places adjacent \u2026 with above fower and twenty thousand loads yearly of rootes\u201d.

In Australia, almost nine out of 10 plant species fit that bill.But the nation isn\u2019t doing what\u2019s needed to understand if they are in trouble.\u201cBy international standards, Australia performed very poorly in conservation assessments,\u201d said Western Sydney University\u2019s Rachael Gallagher, who led the global evaluation of those efforts.Only 39% of Australia\u2019s unique species have had their threats and conservation status assessed \u2013 less than half of what New Zealand and South Africa have managed.Australia\u2019s efforts were more on par with low-income countries such as Madagascar, on 42%.\u201cWithout comprehensive assessment thousands of unique Australian plant and fungi species could be at risk, and we have no way of knowing which species or where to direct conservation efforts,\u201d Gallagher said.The New South Wales floral emblem, the waratah, is a perfect example. Its extinction risk has never been assessed even though it is targeted by illegal flower collectors, and threatened by climate change and altered fire regimes.Australia is also home to about 1,000 of the world\u2019s 1,350 acacia, or wattle, species.

However, these weather patterns are probably exacerbated by climate breakdown and the heating atmosphere.\u201cThe more we burn fossil fuels, the more excess heat will be taken out by the oceans, which means the longer it will take to stabilise them and get them back to where they were,\u201d Burgess told the BBC.This week, the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, announced more than 100 new oil and gas licences in the North Sea, against the advice of climate experts.Oceans also regulate the climate, soaking up heat, driving weather patterns, acting as a carbon sink and providing respite as cool air blowing off the sea can make hot land temperatures more bearable. However, these useful impacts lessen as the oceans heat, and warm waters also have less ability to absorb carbon dioxide, which means there will be more of the greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Warming oceans also contribute to ice melting, which causes sea level rise.Sea surface temperature measurements made from ships go back more than 150 years and are some of the longest instrumental records available for understanding the climate. For the past 40 years, there have also been measurements available from satellites and buoys.From this data, scientists have found that over the full period of the records, global mean sea surface temperature has increased by close to 0.9C, and that the increase over the past four decades is about 0.6C. The latest five-year average is about 0.2C above the average between 1991 and 2020.Some of the fastest warming areas are parts of the Arctic Ocean, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea and parts of the extra-tropical Pacific.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "A network of underground geothermal plants is being touted as a way to help level up the UK after a report discovered many areas with the greatest geothermal potential lie beneath the towns and cities most in need of investment.Areas that have been earmarked by the government as part of its levelling up agenda are about three times as likely to be rich in untapped energy from the earth, according to an academic study commissioned by No 10.GraphicThe University of Durham found these include Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough, East Lindsey, Hartlepool, Northumberland and Bassetlaw, which all appear in the top 10 of the index used by government to identify local authority areas in need of levelling up.Other areas well-suited to producing geothermal heat and electricity include Newcastle upon Tyne, North East Derbyshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire and Nottingham.Harnessing geothermal energy involves drilling a borehole to depths of about two to three miles, to flow cold water at low pressures through the hot rocks beneath the Earth\u2019s surface. A second borehole returns the warm water to the surface where it can be used to heat homes and businesses or generate electricity.Kieran Mullan MP, who was tasked with producing the report, said the \u201cstrong overlap\u201d between areas in need of investment and the best geothermal locations was unexpected, but it could provide another reason for the government to look again at supporting the renewable energy technology.\u201cUnlike wind or solar this technology provides baseload \u2013 it is there constantly. And our expertise in drilling in the North Sea means we are well placed to motor ahead,\u201d Mullan said.The UK\u2019s early steps into geothermal energy include a project in Seaham, County Durham, which will use water from mineshafts to heat 1,500 new homes and a scheme at the Eden project in Cornwall which generates heat to warm Eden\u2019s rainforest and Mediterranean biomes as well as offices, kitchens and greenhouses.prime English sites for geothermal energyIn theory, the UK has enough geothermal energy trapped underground to heat every home for a hundred years. Even by conservative estimates that account for realistic commercial and logistical limits, geothermal energy could help the UK to cut its imports of fossil fuels and rely only on the North Sea for its gas.\u201cBut we have catching up to do because across Europe there has been much stronger government intervention to support nascent deep geothermal industries in those countries,\u201d Mullan said.Deep geothermal energy is abundant in Iceland owing to its unique geology but countries in western Europe are increasingly using geothermal energy to help produce green heating.Already more than 250,000 homes in Paris rely on geothermal heating and the German government has committed to spending \u20ac1bn (\u00a3860m) before 2035 to create 100 geothermal projects.Rishi Sunak said the report would help the government decide whether there was a bigger role for deep geothermal energy in the UK economy.\u201cWe have made rapid progress on switching to homegrown renewable electricity and have made energy security a key priority. Success is going to depend on pulling all the levers at our disposal,\u201d the prime minister said.",

        "text": "What would you do with an extra \u00a3730? That\u2019s the amount the average UK household wastes each year, by throwing away untouched or unopened food, according to the waste and sustainability charity Wrap. That\u2019s a staggering 2m tonnes and the equivalent of roughly one in every three bags of groceries we bring into our homes. Food waste is not only bad for our pockets, it\u2019s bad for the environment, too: 36m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions could be saved if we stopped throwing it into landfill. Storing ingredients properly to keep them fresher for longer, planning mealtimes and getting creative with leftovers are three simple ways with which we can reduce our food-waste footprint. Let\u2019s start with the UK\u2019s five most-wasted ingredients.Bread We chuck out about 20m slices of bread every day. I always store half my fresh loaves in the freezer, sliced and wrapped tightly. Revive a stale loaf by sprinkling with a little water, placing on a lined baking sheet and into a low oven for a few minutes (or in the microwave in 30-second blasts). Alternatively, turn it into breadcrumbs (or do like the Italians and make pangrattato), use to thicken soups, such as pappa al pomodoro (Tuscan bread and tomato soup), ribollita and gazpacho, or use instead of pine nuts in a pesto; they\u2019re the secret to thicker sauces, too.Leafy greens Some 40% of all bagged salad gets thrown away. To extend its shelf life, wash, pat dry and store half in a sealed container with a sheet of kitchen roll. Blanch the other half, squeeze out the excess water, wrap in a bag and freeze for stews, curries and stir-fries. Or blitz leafy greens with a splash of milk for smoothies, pancake batter or in sweet and savoury bakes such as muffins or chocolate cake \u2013 this is a great way to sneak a few extra greens into meals, and you won\u2019t even taste them. You can also freeze blitzed greens in ice-cube trays.Bananas Whip overripe bananas into cake batters, muffins or pancakes (they add natural sweetness and act as a thickener), or chop and freeze for smoothies and \u201cnice cream\u201d (AKA peeled and blitzed frozen banana). If they\u2019re organic, you can eat the skins, too. I make a mean BLT (banana peel, lettuce and tomato sandwich) with them: shred the peel with a fork, then marinate in two tablespoons of soy sauce, two teaspoons of brown sugar, a teaspoon of smoked paprika, a dash of liquid smoke and a pinch of garlic powder for 15 minutes. Fry until crisp, then coat with the remaining marinade, or bake for 15 minutes at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, turning halfway.Potatoes More than 4.4m potatoes are binned in the UK every day. If they start to sprout, cut them out and the potatoes will be fine to eat \u2013 but if they start turning green, it\u2019s time to compost. Store them in a cool, dry, well-ventilated cupboard, covered in newspaper and away from heat sources such as the oven or fridge. Looking for a fun way to eat leftover roasties? Pop them in a waffle maker, and you\u2019ll have mini potato waffles in minutes.Milk  Every day, 3.1 million glasses\u2019 worth of milk get poured down the sink. Freeze in ice-cube trays to add to sauces (bechamel, garlic cream, alfredo or for mac and cheese). Or make panna cotta, baked rice pudding, batter for French toast or custard.\nYou Can Cook This!: Simple, Satisfying, Sustainable Veg Recipes, by Max La Manna, is published by Ebury Press at \u00a322.

        "text": "State Farm, the country\u2019s largest property insurer, announced this week that it will almost entirely stop issuing new policies in California, the country\u2019s largest property insurance market. The reasons for forgoing all that new business are entirely economic. The company cited \u201chistoric increases in construction costs outpacing inflation, rapidly growing catastrophe exposure, and a challenging reinsurance market\u201d. Those things are owed largely to the wildfires engulfing bigger parts of the state in bigger chunks of the year.California\u2019s woes have a lot to do with the climate crisis, which fuels the hot, dry conditions that turn wooded hills into kindling. It\u2019s also a political failure. Housing crises in the Golden state have pushed more and more people out of densely populated areas and into the so-called wildland-urban interface \u2013 places that are cheaper to live in, and more prone to burn. Wealthy homeowners in fire-prone enclaves are also reluctant to move, keen to keep rebuilding properties that keep getting destroyed.Similar dynamics are playing out around the country. Insurance companies are hiking up costs or wholly withdrawing from some areas after deadly, costly flooding in Appalachia and hurricanes in Louisiana and Florida, where property insurance rates are now roughly triple the national average. In each case the rich will make out all right, for now, able to pony up the cost of more expensive policies or relocation. The rest will find themselves on the losing end of what happens when the private sector is entrusted with planning for climate chaos.State Farm didn\u2019t mention climate change in its announcement, of course. The sector has been under pressure from rightwingers that have attacked private sector initiatives like the Net Zero Insurers Alliance (NZIA) as a plot by shadowy globalists to enforce a radical climate agenda through undemocratic means; more concretely, Republican lawmakers are engaged in sabre-rattling premised on the notion that such alliances constitute a violation of antitrust rules.Owing to such pressures, 11 global insurers have left the NZIA since March. The irony of the Republican crusade against all things ESG (environmental, social and governance investment principles) takes flashy corporate climate pledges at face value, alleging that Wall Street is substituting ideology for what should be a focus on the bottom line. But ESG, for companies, is all about protecting profits. State Farm \u2013 which touts its own ESG commitments \u2013 is leaving California, it said, \u201cto improve the company\u2019s financial strength\u201d.Republican lawmakers are trying to ban companies from making similarly pragmatic considerations of climate risk in their planning. Governments, meanwhile, have been slow to do much climate planning at all. There is no comprehensive federal plan to house people \u2013 let alone whole communities \u2013 wiped out by climate-fueled storms and floods, despite the fact that some 13.1 million people could be displaced by sea-level rise through the end of the century.When governments don\u2019t plan for such events, corporations fill the gap, raising prices and deepening existing inequalities. Even the relatively well-off will be left to navigate a thicket of piecemeal, neglected public programs and private-sector middlemen to rebuild their lives.Rising prices and coverage gaps aren\u2019t some moral failure on the part of State Farm or any other for-profit firm, just business: these companies exist to return value to their shareholders. The government\u2019s job, though, is to protect its people. That it\u2019s failing to do that now doesn\u2019t bode well for an even more climate-ravaged future.\nKate Aronoff is a staff writer at the New Republic and the author of Overheated: How Capitalism Broke the Planet \u2013 And How We Fight Back\n",

The study\u2019s first author, Prof John Woinarski of Charles Darwin University, said this made getting adequate information for some of the species \u201cquite tricky\u201d.Some species, such as the Flinders Ranges worm-lizard, southern cassowary and gouldian finch, have benefited from habitat management, the researchers found.Populations of others have increased after intensive control of introduced predators, and by translocating animals to predator-free islands.The EPBC Act stipulates that species should not be delisted if doing so might have a negative impact on their survival. While the researchers believe successes should be celebrated, they warn that conservations gains could be lost if management efforts were to cease.Sarah Legge, study co-author and professor at Australian National University, said: \u201cAustralian mammals are so sensitive to cat and fox predation, and one of the most effective things you can do is exclude cats and foxes with fencing or by marooning the species on an island.\u201d\u201cMost of these mammal species used to occur in really big distributions across the continent. Now they\u2019re only found in areas \u2026 which cover less than 1% of their previous distribution,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve prevented extinction but we haven\u2019t really solved the problem.\u201dWoinarski described the improvements as \u201cpartial successes\u201d that depended upon ongoing active management.\u201cAlmost no species that are affected by broad scale vegetation loss, clearing, forestry, climate change or changed fire regimes have recovered.\u201dNo threatened invertebrates recovered significantly, which the researchers suggest may be the result of the limited conservation funding for insects.\u201cThe limited recovery of fish is due to limited capacity for abating the threats of introduced fish predators and of exploitation and degradation of aquatic systems,\u201d they wrote.Dr Michelle Ward, a conservation scientist at WWF Australia who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cThe key problem with delisting species is that then they no longer have monitoring and are no longer are eligible for certain funding schemes.\u201dAssoc Prof Conrad Hoskin, a terrestrial ecologist at James Cook University, said the delisting of the two frog species made sense for prioritising conservation efforts.Conservationists were better off \u201cfocusing on things that are in decline or in severe threat\u201d, he said.",

Most call for fresh white breadcrumbs, made without the crusts, as well as a clove-studded onion that\u2019s infused with milk and then thrown in the bin. Why, I have no clue. Save time and waste, and embrace the beige: use brown bread, keep the crusts on (even bread ends work here) and add a little grated onion instead of using and chucking a whole one. Your brown bread sauce will be more nutritious and flavourful for it. Even if you\u2019re a staunch traditionalist and insist on using a whole onion, after lifting it from the milk, remove the cloves, cut the onion in half and roast it alongside your other Christmas veg, or use it as a trivet on which to roast the meat (at the very least it will give your gravy a great head start), or save it and put in a Boxing Day stew.Leftover brown bread sauce (with dairy and vegan options)When I make bread sauce, I tend to use stale brown bread, complete with crusts, bread ends and all, because that\u2019s what we usually buy in. It will turn the sauce a delicate, light beige colour, and fill it with flavour and nutrition. Keep bread ends and crusts out of plastic packaging, so they can dry completely, then box up until needed, or freeze.

Its terms of reference state: \u201cThe taskforce will meet fortnightly, with exact frequency and timings of meetings at the discretion of the chairperson in consultation with the group members.\u201d Its goals are \u201cto develop: proposals to significantly reduce the frequency and impact of sewage discharges from storm overflows short-term actions to accelerate progress to reduce the harm caused by storm overflows\u201d.Last August the group published its storm overflows reduction plan, which gives water companies a deadline of 2035 to reduce the amount of sewage flowing into bathing water and areas of ecological importance. Water companies were given a deadline of 2050 to stop dumping raw sewage elsewhere.The then environment secretary, George Eustice, said water companies would have to invest \u00a356bn over 25 years to tackle storm sewage discharges by 2050. But the plan was heavily criticised as too weak and is to be challenged in court by the Good Law Project and the campaign group WildFish. Since that publication the taskforce has not met again, the freedom of information request shows.The Good Law Project sought all fortnightly meeting dates of the taskforce between 1 April 2022 to 25 April this year, but Defra revealed it had only met once in that time, on 30 August 2022. There have been no follow-up meetings to drive through the storm overflow reduction plan, or to check progress.A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cOur taskforce delivered exactly what it set out to do \u2013 develop proposals to significantly reduce the frequency and impact of sewage discharges from storm overflows. This was delivered through our storm overflows discharge reduction plan, which was published in August 2022 and will require the largest infrastructure programme in water company history - \u00a356bn capital investment over 25 years.\u201dEngland has about 14,500 storm overflows, which are supposed to be used in exceptionally heavy rain to stop the sewage system backing up into people\u2019s homes. But water companies have been routinely dumping raw sewage into rivers and seas even in periods of dry weather.In 2021 the taskforce published a report that estimated the cost of cutting millions of hours of raw sewage discharges from storm overflows would be between \u00a3150bn and \u00a3660bn \u2013 figures that were challenged by some experts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It could also switch it back on or increase power if there\u2019s a surplus of electricity.Queensland could be the only jurisdiction in the world considering the radical step, according to the submission by the Clean Energy Council (CEC).\u201cWe are concerned the proposed changes to EVSE [electric vehicle supply equipment] installation may deter consumers from investing in EVs,\u201d the CEC said.In its submission, the Electric Vehicle Council said it shows Energy Queensland believes people \u201ccan\u2019t be trusted to manage their own EV charging\u201d.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe council is one of several groups to express concerns with the proposed reform, including organisations as diverse as the RACQ and Energy Consumers Australia.Chris Lehmann, the national advocacy manager at Master Electricians Australia, said Energy Queensland was \u201cconservative\u201d and understandably worried about grid stability, as the growth in EVs drives peak power demand.But he said the state had chosen the wrong tool for the job. \u201cWe do believe there\u2019s a better way that they could do it,\u201d he said.\u201cWe think at the moment the approach is all stick, not much carrot. We should be going for a little bit more carrot, a little less stick approach, and incentivising people to change their energy-usage behaviour.\u201dHe argued for a greater availability and use of \u201ctime of use tariffs\u201d, which charge energy users more for power during peak periods, while granting a discount when the grid is quieter. The perceived benefit of a price-driven approach is that it leaves it up to EV owners to decide how they choose to save or use power, rather than through a top-down approach.The RACQ\u2019s head of public policy, Michael Kane, said renters in particular would struggle with installing the technology required under the regulations.\u201cThey seem to be assuming that it\u2019s only rich people who will be buying EVs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it gets to the secondhand market and people are charging secondhand EVs, how you charge is a key part of making this all stack up in terms of affordability.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Residents suggested that dust from the mine had settled on their roofs and been washed into tanks.Most properties within a 15km radius of the mine, which is about 22km from Orange, rely on rainwater for their potable water supply.Eight coal projects to be considered by NSW forecast to add 1.5bn tonnes to global emissionsRead moreA spokesperson for Newcrest Mining, which operates the goldmine, said it had been told about some water testing results from some residents but that the contamination did not correlate with the results of their own air quality monitoring programs.Western NSW Local Health District said it \u201cdoes not conduct investigations into environmental or ecological factors which may broadly affect the management of water collected privately, including rainwater\u201d, but that it was assisting residents with testing their household tanks.\u201cFollowing independent testing not conducted by NSW Health, the community has raised concern with the District\u2019s PHU [public health unit] regarding the safety and quality of privately collected drinking water at a number of private residences south of Orange,\u201d a spokesperson said.\u201cThe District will conduct additional sampling and testing of the drinking water at a number of those residences supplied only by rainwater, to assist residents in identifying any potential contamination which could pose a health risk.\u201cShould the District\u2019s testing return results outside the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines at any residence, the PHU will provide support and advice to assess and identify immediate sources of contamination and rectify any issues of concern.\u201dIt added that management of private water supplies such as rainwater tanks was ultimately the responsibility of the householder.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nNewcrest said the cause of the contamination was \u201ccurrently unknown\u201d.

        "text": "Like most Londoners, Tanya Beri has mixed views of the city\u2019s vast underground rail network that carries millions of passengers every day on its 11 lines and through its 272 stations. The tube keeps London moving, though often in cramped, uncomfortable and unhygienic conditions.However, Beri believes she has found a way to improve travel for concerned commuters. She has developed a phone app that can direct passengers to routes that offer minimal air pollution.\u201cThe UK safe limit for healthy air is to have fewer than 25 small particles in a cubic metre of air,\u201d said Beri. \u201cIn some places on the underground, it can top 200 per cubic metre. I want to help people avoid that.\u201dStudies have suggested that long-term exposure to fine particulates could be linked to increased rates of chronic bronchitis and increased mortality from lung cancer and heart disease.Beri, 29, will be given one of Innovate UK\u2019s Young Innovators awards at a ceremony this week for her work on developing the app. She will be among the 94 young entrepreneurs who will receive some \u00a31.25m in grants to help them tackle some of biggest challenges facing society in Britain. Other inventions to be given awards range from cheap alternatives to plastic based on onion skins to a smart medication dispenser that promotes patient independence.Beri\u2019s app suggests routes that provide the lowest risk of breathing air with high pollution levels. \u201cIt\u2019s like a TfL [Transport for London] or Google app but instead of offering the speediest journey between destinations it provides routes with the lowest air pollution,\u201d she said.An example is provided by a passenger from North Harrow tube station to Canary Wharf, part of London\u2019s business district, said Beri. \u201cIf you go the quickest way, via the Jubilee line, then you face pollution that is about 220 particles per cubic metre. If you take the slower route and stay on the Metropolitan line, you will face pollution of about 50 particles per cubic metre. That is still over the safe limit but it is less than a quarter of what you would experience on the Jubilee line.\u201dResearchers have found the underground lines with the most polluted air are the Northern, Bakerloo, Jubilee and Victoria \u2013 because they are the deepest. By contrast, lines such as the Metropolitan, Circle and District have stations that are nearer the surface or are actually at surface level and so are better ventilated compared with deep lines where insufficient airflow allows particulates to accumulate.In one study by scientists at King\u2019s College London, it was found that particulate concentrations in trains on the Victoria and Northern lines were greater than those from studies of underground trains in Beijing, Guangzhou, New York, Barcelona and many other cities, while stations at Oxford Circus, Waterloo and London Bridge were rated as some of the worst on the tube.As to the causes of the particulates that float through stations and trains, studies have indicated that most are generated as wheels, tracks and brakes grind against one another, throwing up tiny, iron-rich particles. These vary in size, with those under 2.5 micrometres in diameter \u2013 known as PM2.5 (particulate matter 2.5) \u2013 causing special concern. They can reach deep into your lungs and enter your bloodstream to be transported around the body, affecting other organs.These are the particles to be monitored by Beri\u2019s app, which will be launched later this year. She has also set up a company, CAIR, that will market it.It was the problem of air pollution that attracted Beri to start researching her invention. \u201cI used to commute on the underground,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd sometimes I got sick after travelling on it. So I thought it would be a good idea to find a way to help people who are worst affected by air pollution. Hence the idea of the app.\u201dData about pollution levels at tube stations is stored electronically, and a starting point and destination are keyed into the app, which then produces the best low-pollution route for the traveller. \u201cIt is simple to operate \u2013 which is another key advantage,\u201d she added.",

A crumbling petrol station, a pair of abandoned cars, a caravan that could once have been towed on myriad, jolly holidays and is now abandoned on a hilltop.A collection of beautiful photographs taken by the Welsh landscape photographer David Wilson drawn together in a book called Peeling Paint and Rust is a hymn to decay, and a respectful nod to the power of his country\u2019s rain and damp.Wilson, who is based in Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales, is known for his black and white landscape photographs, but for two decades has also been taking colour pictures of structures that are \u2013 just about \u2013 withstanding the elements.\u201cOn my travels, I kept encountering the incredible colours and textures of peeling paint and rust,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cI\u2019d be on my way to a location and suddenly I\u2019d see a bright, flaking village shopfront \u2013 or a corrugated garage or tractor graveyard and be stopped in my tracks. The colours were amazing and I had to capture them.\u201cOver nearly 20 years I accumulated a collection of images of this wonderful decay and one day I realised that they hung together as a whole. Together, they tell a story of rural Wales. The patina of weather-aged surfaces and rusting metal feel like works of art to me.\u201dWilson said Wales wasn\u2019t kind to bodywork and neglected buildings. \u201cWales has proper weather. Brutal on occasion. The kind of weather that degrades our best efforts at preservation. Paint peels and metal rusts in outdoor Wales.\u201dHis studies of corrugated iron are particularly striking. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken it as our own.

We Welsh love this crinkly material.\u201dBut Wilson acknowledged the sadness in the pictures. \u201cI felt I was documenting a dislocation in the rural communities of Wales. A dying way of life. The world moves on and it seemed to have left these places and their objects behind.\u201dHe said it was becoming difficult to find studies in decay. \u201cPeople are inclined to tidy things up. Put things right. That obsession with neatness and order.\u201dDrew Pritchard, the antique dealer and presenter of the television show Salvage Hunters, said there was a unique beauty in dereliction and decay.The book, which is published on Thursday, reminded Pritchard of roaming the abandoned buildings in and around the small village on the coast of north Wales where he grew up and admiring the flaking paint of a corrugated chapel roof, Stan the Butcher\u2019s tatty shop sign and a Ford Zephyr marooned on the front yard of the local garage.He likes the way Wilson has put \u201cthe eroded, the rust-bitten and the slowly fading away\u201d front and centre, almost as if they were portraits of people. \u201cWilson\u2019s images serve as a celebratory obituary to those too stubborn to crumble,\u201d he said.",

A roadmap would be developed to \u201charmonise\u201d kerbside waste collection across the country and a framework for recycled content traceability would be introduced to give business confidence to use recycled materials, it said.Plibersek said while some in the industry had voluntarily reduced their impact, it had been \u201cjust not enough\u201d. An official review in April found Australia was recycling just 18% of plastic packaging, and would fall well short of a target of 70% by 2025.The minister said the call for regulation had been supported by some major companies including Nestl\u00e9, Unilever and Coca-Cola.\u201cWe need to dramatically reduce packaging waste, and the harmful chemicals that destroy our environment. We see packaging in the guts of dead birds, floating in our oceans, destroying nature as it takes generations to degrade,\u201d she said. \u201cPut simply, we\u2019re making too much, using too much, and too much is ending up in landfill.\u201dThe Boomerang Alliance, a coalition of 55 environment groups, said the agreement was the first \u201csubstantial and meaningful step\u201d to deal with waste in 20 years.\u201cThis is absolutely the right decision, and a key first step to tackle the growing waste and plastic pollution harming the oceans and climate,\u201d the alliance\u2019s director, Jeff Angel, said.\u201cMandatory standards for recycled content and targets are essential to create the economic rationale for new recycling and reprocessing plants. New rules to minimise wasteful packaging will also help tackle the plastic waste and pollution tidal wave projected by the UN.\u201dAngel said the agreement needed to be followed by \u201ca comprehensive product stewardship scheme\u201d that forced industry to pay for collection and recycling programs.He said it must avoid the mistakes of the failed REDcycle scheme, which led to 12,000 tonnes of soft plastics collected at supermarkets being stockpiled in warehouses across three states while consumers were told it was being recycled.Much of Australia\u2019s recyclable rubbish was sent overseas until August 2019, when then prime minister Scott Morrison announced a ban on the export of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres. Coalition and Labor governments subsequently announced hundreds of millions in funding for recycling facilities, but until now resisted rules that ensured they would be viable.The announcement comes amid a global push to cut plastic use. Plibersek attended negotiations in Paris on a proposed global plastic treaty earlier this month.The Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association, representing companies that deal with rubbish and recycling, welcomed an agreement, saying it meant there would \u201cfinally be real action\u201d on packaging.The association\u2019s chief executive, Gayle Sloan, said it was \u201ca great start\u201d and \u201cthe first step on the path to creating the level playing field industry desperately needs between virgin and recycled materials\u201d.The environment group World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia said the agreement would \u201chave a major impact on Australia\u2019s plastic pollution crisis\u201d.",

EU countries\u2019 ambassadors on Friday cancelled the vote that had been planned for 7 March, the spokesperson for Sweden said.That has put the law on ice days before it was due to receive final approval. An attempt to block or change an EU policy this late in the lawmaking process is highly unusual.German transport minister, Volker Wissing, reiterated on Friday that the use of synthetic fuels should remain possible after the 2035 deadline and that the European Commission\u2019s promised proposal on how to make this happen was still missing.\u201cWe want climate-neutral mobility,\u201d and to do so means being open to all conceivable technologies, he told a news conference.A non-binding section of the EU law says the Commission will make a proposal on how vehicles running on CO2-neutral fuels can be sold after 2035, if this complies with climate goals. But Germany\u2019s transport ministry wants clearer assurances.A Commission spokesperson on Friday said it \u201cwill consider the potential contribution of CO2-neutral fuels to reach climate neutral mobility\u201d, adding that it was in contact with countries to discuss their issues with the law.\u201cThe transition to zero-emission vehicles is absolutely necessary to meet our 2030 and 2050 climate targets,\u201d the spokesperson added.Transport accounts for nearly a quarter of EU emissions and has bucked the EU\u2019s overall trend of falling CO2 output over the past three decades, threatening to thwart the bloc\u2019s targets to slash planet-warming emissions.Italy, which has previously said it will vote against the EU cars law, on Friday welcomed the postponement of the vote.\u201cItaly has a very clear position \u2013 electric [cars] cannot be the only solution for the future,\u201d energy minister Gilberto Pichetto Fratin said, adding that vehicles running on \u201crenewable fuels\u201d should be considered an \u201cequally clean\u201d option.Germany\u2019s Free Democratic party (FDP) has long been an advocate for climate-neutral synthetic fuels, also known as e-fuels, arguing their use would enable the continued use of combustion engines.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

So our low-lying atoll countries, it\u2019s right there, we\u2019re living with it,\u201d said Mata\u2019afa.\u201cThere are already examples in the Pacific of communities, whole communities, that have relocated to different countries,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re really having to address issues of sovereignty through loss of land.\u201dMata\u2019afa warned that all countries would face escalating damage unless they acted now. \u201cThis is a collective issue, no one is free from the impacts of climate change,\u201d she said, in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cSo it\u2019s very important for the global family to hold to determinations [to cut greenhouse gas emissions] that have already been made. It seems more immediate for us [in the Pacific] but it\u2019s still impacting all of us.\u201dFiame Naomi Mata\u2019afa. Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty ImagesOn Monday, the IPCC will produce the final summary of its latest appraisal of global climate science. Known as the \u201csynthesis report\u201d, it is expected to warn that the world has only a few years in which to achieve a profound shift to a global low-carbon economy, or face catastrophe from extreme weather, including rising sea levels, intense heatwaves and devastating droughts, heavier floods and a cascade of other impacts.The report will also set out ways in which to achieve this low-carbon economy, and to keep global heating within the crucial threshold of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, beyond which the IPCC has warned of impacts that will rapidly become catastrophic and irreversible.Mata\u2019afa said: \u201cWith the work of the IPCC, there is a glimmering hope that there is a body of evidence that can support the decisions that need to be made. [People in Samoa are] having faith that [this message] will bear through.\u201dThe IPCC is the world\u2019s leading body of climate scientists, with hundreds of lead authors drawing on the peer-reviewed work of thousands of scientists to produce comprehensive reports, thousands of pages long, that sum up global knowledge of the crisis.Over the last two years, the IPCC has released its sixth such assessment since 1988, in three parts from August 2021 to March 2022. This final report, called the synthesis report, will summarise the previous warnings and present them to global governments.IPCC reports take six to eight years to compile, so this will be the last before 2030, by which time the world may have already breached the 1.5C threshold, unless greenhouse gas emissions fall rapidly in the next few years.Prof Emily Shuckburgh, the director of Cambridge Zero at the University of Cambridge, said: \u201cThe science is clearer than ever, and once more the world\u2019s scientists remind us how little time we have left to limit warming to 1.5C.

While we are seeing some progress, frankly, we are moving far too slowly in decarbonising our economies and adapting to the changing climate,\u201d he told the Guardian.He called for more investment. \u201cFinance is key, and delivering the trillions of dollars for climate action, which many leaders have talked about, is now critical,\u201d he said.The islands of the Pacific represent some of the most at-risk nations, and had been instrumental in calling for other countries to accept the 1.5C limit, said Mata\u2019afa.Samoa, made up of nine small islands in the mid-Pacific, about halfway between New Zealand and Hawaii, contains some higher ground than many of its atoll neighbours. But the country is still facing rising seas and more devastating storms.Mata\u2019afa, Samoa\u2019s first female PM, attended a Commonwealth Secretariat event in London last week, where the role of women in tackling the climate crisis was discussed.",

        "text": "Chaat is one of my favourite Indian street foods. Popular across the whole of south Asia, it normally consists of something fried, such as a poppadom, samosa or pakora, that is usually crushed up and loaded with a variety of flavourful spicy, sweet and salty chutneys and crunchy treats. It\u2019s often finished off with a sev (fried gram flour vermicelli) topping (if you can\u2019t find sev, Bombay mix works fine, too). One of my favourite chaats features spinach fried in chickpea flour batter; this beetroot leaf version makes a tasty, colourful and thrifty replacement.Beetroot leaf chaatFor this year\u2019s Ramadan, the charity Islamic Relief invited me to write a few low-waste recipes for its #FastOnWaste campaign. I gave them three: a moussaka with lentils, spinach and seasonal root veg, a spring tabbouleh with millet, and a smashed beetroot and chickpea chaat. This take on the latter uses beetroot leaves to make delicious pakoras by coating them in chickpea flour batter and frying until golden and crunchy. Make sure you wash the leaves and stalks very well, because they are often full of soil. The leaves need to be nice and dry for the batter to stick, too, so if need be, pat them in a clean tea towel. Beetroots are in season now and are often sold by greengrocers in bunches with their leaves still attached; if you can\u2019t find any, you can also make this with rainbow chard or spinach.Serves 26-8 beetroot leaves, including their stalks, well washed60g gram flour2 tsp chaat masala or garam masalaVegetable or mustard oil, for fryingThe toppings, to serve1-2 tsp chaat masala or garam masala\u00bc red onion, finely chopped4 tbsp yoghurt (or a plant-based alternative)3-4 tbsp fresh coriander chutney (see below and method)3-4 tbsp tamarind chutney or concentrate3-4 tbsp sev (or Bombay mix)1 handful fresh coriander leavesSeeds from \u00bc pomegranateFor the coriander chutney20g bunch coriander1 tsp finely chopped green chilli1 tsp grated ginger\u00bd tsp ground cumin1 tbsp lemon juiceBlack salt or sea salt, to tasteTo make the coriander chutney, pick off all the leaves from the bunch, then finely chop the stalks.

Once hot, dip the beetroot leaves one at a time in the batter, shake off any excess and carefully drop into the hot oil. Fry until crisp underneath, then flip and fry until crisp on the other side. Drain on kitchen towel or a wire rack.To assemble the chaat, arrange the beetroot leaf pakoras on a platter and dust with the chaat masala or garam masala. Top with the chopped onion and the yoghurt (or a plant-based alternative), dollop on the coriander chutney and tamarind chutney (or concentrate), then top with the sev.

        "text": "Using a gas stove can raise indoor concentrations of benzene, a cancer-linked chemical, to above what is found in secondhand smoking or even beyond levels found next to oil and gas facilities, a new study has found.The research, which measured benzene levels in 87 homes in California and Colorado, found that gas and propane stoves frequently emitted benzene at rates well above healthy benchmarks set by the World Health Organization and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).Leaving a single gas hob on for 45 minutes raised benzene levels to above that found in secondhand tobacco smoking, or at the boundary of oil and gas plants, with emissions 10 to 25 times higher than that from electric coil stoves. Even low-burning hobs, or gas oven use, emit significant levels of benzene. Induction stoves emit no benzene at all, the researchers found.The peer-reviewed study, led by scientists at Stanford University, is the first to use new monitors to effectively measure benzene indoors. Even low doses of airborne benzene raise the risk of a variety of cancers, including lymphomas and leukemia, by damaging people\u2019s bone marrow. Elevated levels of benzene can linger for six hours throughout a house or apartment after a gas stove is turned off.\u201cI\u2019m hard-pressed to think of a more powerful chemical cause of leukemia than benzene,\u201d said Jan Kirsch, a California-based oncologist who said that people had in their homes a \u201cvery potent\u201d cause of blood cell cancers.\u201cPeople have died, undoubtably, from exposure to benzene in their homes and unless this problem is ameliorated people will continue to do so,\u201d Kirsch said. \u201cThe idea is not to cause panic, but there are risks and we want to reduce them. It\u2019s important this message is carried to the public, so we can understand and act on it.\u201dMore than a third of households in the US use gas stoves, although many lack adequate ventilation to help reduce dangerous levels of benzene, the researchers said. Range hoods, even when they are used, often just circulate air around a dwelling rather than expel the harmful chemicals.The result is indoor air hazards that often rival, or even exceed, the sort of outdoor air pollution that has been reduced through clean air regulations over the past 50 years.Gas stoves \u201care the only common fossil fuel appliance to vent pollution indoors\u201d, said Rob Jackson, a scientist at Stanford who helped lead the new research. \u201cWe would never willingly stand over the tailpipe of a car, breathing in its pollution, but we do willingly stand over our stoves, breathing in the pollution they emit,\u201d he added.Decades of previous research has highlighted the dangers posed by a stew of different emissions, including carbon monoxide and formaldehyde, that come from the burning of gas indoors. A study from earlier this year found that gas stoves are responsible for more than 12% of all childhood asthma cases in the US, with separate research discovering that a series of different pollutants are expelled from gas stoves, even after they are turned off.Joe Biden\u2019s administration has attempted to formulate efficiency standards for new stoves to lower such pollution, with around half of all stoves currently sold likely to fail the proposed safeguards. Several states, such as New York, have moved to phase out gas appliances in new buildings, too.This has provoked a furious political backlash, however, with Ron DeSantis, the Republican presidential hopeful, seeking to prevent any sort of gas stove ban in Florida, the state in which he is governor. Republicans in both the US House of Representatives and the Senate, meanwhile, have pushed forward legislation that would prohibit the banning of gas stoves.\u201cNothing is off limits to the radical left\u2019s Green New Deal agenda,\u201d said Markwayne Mullin, a Republican senator who signed onto the bill last week to \u201cget Washington out of our kitchens and our pocketbooks\u201d. Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat from West Virginia, has joined with the Republicans, complaining last week that the \u201cfederal government has no business telling Americans how to cook their dinner\u201d.Stanford\u2019s Jackson pointed out that there is no proposal to remove people\u2019s existing gas stoves but that it made sense to encourage the adoption of cleaner-burning appliances when stove purchases are made in order to protect public health.\u201cWe should incentivize the use of induction stoves, particularly in lower-income communities,\u201d he said.\u201cWe stopped cooking over coal a century ago in the US because gas is cleaner and today I believe we should eventually stop cooking over gas because electricity is cleaner. We have a cleaner technology available today.\u201d",

        "text": "Animal rights campaigners are urging Michael Gove to stop the construction of the UK\u2019s first fully on-land salmon farm, claiming the decision to give it planning permission was flawed.Animal Equality says an environmental impact assessment (EIA) should have been carried out before North East Lincolnshire council (NELC) gave the green light to the salmon farm in Cleethorpes, which it says would be the UK\u2019s biggest on land or at sea.While government guidance says each case should be judged on its merits, it states that the indicative threshold for an EIA to be appropriate is where a farm is designed to produce more than 100 tonnes of fish a year.The Aquacultured Seafood Ltd development aims to produce 5,000 tonnes of fish a year, but was deemed \u201cunlikely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue of factors such as its nature, size or location\u201d. Animal Equality described the decision as \u201cmind-bogglingly irresponsible\u201d.A legal letter, sent to Gove and NELC by the law firm Advocates for Animals on behalf of the charity, says: \u201cDue to the scale of the project, the uniqueness of it, the location and risks to the local wildlife, the impact of any malfunction, or indeed any unforeseen circumstances, has the potential to be huge and complex. In-depth assessment and clarity is especially important for such a new enterprise, where the impacts remain unknown, anything less will be purely speculative.\u201dThe letter says that there are significant risks from water being pumped from the Humber estuary \u2013 which is designated as a \u201cwetland of international importance\u201d under the Ramsar convention \u2013 then pumped back in after it has been used by the farm to house the fish, as well as from contamination to the surrounding area and wildlife from diseased fish. Official figures suggest that salmon mortality on Scottish farms hit record levels this year.The charity also says the farm \u201cplans to use a treatment company that has only been used in Russia and Slovakia; no data has been published as to whether or not it is working successfully\u201d.The rationale given for not conducting an EIA statement was that the farm is an \u201con-land and self-contained facility rather than traditional in water\u201d.But Animal Equality says that the planning authority placed too much reliance on assurances from the developer.The charity\u2019s executive director, Abigail Penny, said: \u201cGiven the abundant uncertainties and obvious risks, it is scandalous that the committee has allowed the application to get this far, let alone to have given it the green light. The lack of diligence on display is disturbing. The government must step in and stop this from going any further. We will continue to do everything in our power to prevent this monstrous fish factory from being constructed\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Above them is the surface ocean, where a dim blue fraction of sunlight filters down. Below them is the deep sea, sunless and black. Which way to look?Their mismatched eyes solve the problem \u2013 by letting them gaze into both worlds at once.The squid are born with two identical eyes, but the left eyeball grows much faster, eventually forming a long tube, often with a bright yellow lens. This huge, highly sensitive eye gazes upwards and looks for the dark silhouettes of food or enemies passing overhead. The yellow colour filters out background light and breaks the camouflage of glowing animals that try to blend with the blue around them.Q&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world\u2019s last truly wild spaces. It teems with fascinating species that sometimes seems to border on the absurd, from fish that look up through transparent heads to golden snails with iron armour. We know more about deep space than deep oceans, and science is only beginning to scratch the surface of the rich variety of life in the depths.As mining companies push to industrialise the sea floor and global leaders continue to squabble over how to protect the high seas, the Guardian's Seascape series, Discovered in the deep, will profile some of the most recently discovered weird, wonderful, majestic, ridiculous, hardcore and mind-blowing creatures. They reveal how much there is still to learn about the least known environment on Earth \u2013 and how much there is to protect.\u00a0Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The right eyeball, meanwhile, ends up less than half the diameter of its partner. The squid aims it downwards, scanning for flashes of glowing animals against the dark waters below.\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely example of how they exploit and inhabit those two very different environments,\u201d says Jon Ablett, senior curator of molluscs at the Natural History Museum in London.Although cockeye squid (Histioteuthis heteropsis) have been known to science for decades, scientists recently caught one on an expedition around the remote Atlantic islands of Ascension and Saint Helena which brilliantly lived up to another name for the creature \u2013 the jewel squid. With an ultraviolet torch shining on it, the squid\u2019s finger-length body twinkled all over in ruby red spots.\u201cWhen you get within about 15cm suddenly everything glows red, and the closer you go, the stronger the colour is,\u201d says James Maclaine, senior curator of fish at the Natural History Museum, who brought a UV torch on the expedition to see which animals perform this trick. \u201cIt\u2019s really dramatic,\u201d he says.Discovered in the deep: a \u2018night-time migration\u2019 of marine life \u2013 in pictures Read moreAs far as he knows, no other scientists have tried shining UV light on deep-sea animals. Maclaine found that some have red-glowing spots, including jewel squid and viperfish, and some, such as lanternfish, don\u2019t.The squid\u2019s red dots are light-emitting organs, known as photophores. Photograph: Kate Thomas/Duke University/NSFThe red dots are light-emitting organs, known as photophores, which actually glow blue when the squid are swimming hundreds of metres underwater. There is no UV light in the deep sea so the photophores don\u2019t glow red in their natural environment.Like the animals they\u2019re trying to spot with their big yellow eye, cockeye squid may use their glowing photophores to disguise their silhouette. Flashing bioluminescent lights could also be a form of squid communication and a way to attract mates. Or they could lure in prey that mistake them for something to eat. \u201cIt\u2019s possibly all of these reasons,\u201d says Ablett, \u201ca little bit of camouflage, a little bit of sexual selection, a little bit of attracting prey.\u201d",

But after failing to take Boris Johnson\u2019s old seat of Uxbridge, Starmer and several of his team urged the Labour mayor to think again.Both camps will hope the new proposals reduce the political pressure including attacks by Rishi Sunak\u2019s government and many Tory MPs who argue the expansion is poorly timed given cost-of-living pressures.The enhanced scrappage programme, which takes the previous \u00a3110m cost to \u00a3160m, the extra paid for out of city hall reserves, keeps the basic grant for a car or van at \u00a32,000 but makes everyone in the city with a non-compliant vehicle eligible.The \u00a32,000 payments were previously only available to people who receive one of a series of benefits, including child benefit and universal credit.Khan\u2019s officials argue that \u00a32,000 is a sufficient sum. They say one vehicle sales website showed almost 5,000 Ulez-compliant cars for sale for less within 200 miles of central London.Sole traders and businesses with fewer than 50 staff can now claim up to \u00a37,000 for each van they replace, up from \u00a35,000, with up to three vans eligible. The previous sum of up to \u00a37,000 for replacing a minibus rises to \u00a39,000, again to a maximum of three. The grant to retrofit a van or minibus has risen from \u00a35,000 to \u00a36,000.There are also increases in grants to replace non-compliant vans or minibuses with electric equivalents, which were greater to start with. The grant to replace a wheelchair-accessible vehicle has been doubled from \u00a35,000 to \u00a310,000.Khan and his officials will hope that the extra money will blunt attacks so political and media focus on the expansion later this month dies down relatively quickly. The mayor\u2019s office points out that about 90% of cars used in outer London are already compliant.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was about to chuck out some pickle juice along with a few leftover raw veg sticks that her kids had left on their plates when her inbuilt, food waste-saving mindset cut in, and she thought of this great way to save both food items. It\u2019s now a go-to in her house for saving all sorts of veg, including cucumbers, cauliflower, carrots, celery, bell peppers and onions, and the process produces a delicious, fresh-tasting refrigerator pickle \u2013 to be safe, though, be sure to consume it within three days.

They said the government had instead prioritised other pieces of legislation, such as a bill for a nature repair market, that \u201cdistract\u201d from its larger commitments.They also wrote that encouraging elements of the proposed reforms that had been presented in draft form to stakeholders risked being undermined by other components.Among nine examples, they said they were particularly concerned about a proposal that would allow the minister to \u201ccall in\u201d and make an approval decision that would otherwise be made by an independent EPA.They also feared \u201cthere will not be sufficient constraints on the use of offsets and that conservation payments will enable payment for destruction\u201d.Delayed environment laws spark calls for urgent government action on water and frackingRead moreHistorically, offsets have been required to be delivered for the same species or habitats affected by development. The approach proposed by the government would relax these requirements by giving developers the option of paying into a fund that could be spent on conservation for a different species or habitat type.Danya Jacobs, special counsel at Environmental Justice Australia, said: \u201cThe proposed laws aren\u2019t there yet but we remain hopeful that the ambition is there, and that government will continue working with stakeholders to make the transformational changes required.\u201dA spokesperson for Plibersek said \u201cwe\u2019ll keep working with stakeholders to get the laws ready for introduction into the parliament next year\u201d.The government is running a staged consultation process with key stakeholders and experts, as well as a series of public webinars in which it presents elements of the proposed reforms.In a webinar on Thursday, the environment department said the reform package would ensure Australia\u2019s new laws were \u201coutcomes focused\u201d and guided by new national standards, in line with the Samuel review\u2019s key recommendation.Six standards would be drafted initially, including one for matters of national environmental significance and another for First Nations engagement.Biodiversity offsets would be rebranded as \u201crestoration actions and restoration contributions\u201d.The proposed new EPA, to be called Environment Protection Australia, would be responsible for decisions about whether a development could proceed and for enforcing the law, which the department said would \u201ctake the politics out of decision-making\u201d. The environment minister would be able to issue a statement of expectations but could not otherwise direct the new agency.",

Both in the extremes of a climate like England and in very hot weather, worms cease their work.\u201dEarthworms are hermaphrodites, which the journalist, all the way back in 1881, expresses in a glittering sentence: \u201cTwo sexes unite in one individual but two individuals pair\u201d.The article was being written because Charles Darwin had just released a study on earthworms, which gives you that strange feeling \u2013 that Darwin, journalists and readers of the New York Times were alive at the same time, that Darwin didn\u2019t just live quietly on the Beagle, beaming ideas into the future.A whale: sleeping vertically, they look as though they could stop time | Helen SullivanRead moreEarthworms are a bit like this. They are alive at the same time as you; when you are a child, they are an enormous part of your world, they move through your mind, digesting it for you, understanding it and choosing what to put where. (Just ask the journalist of 1881: \u201cThe archaeologist has to thank the worm for the preservation of many ancient objects. If he destroys the flesh he leaves intact less destructible substances and many are the coins, the iron arrow-heads of past times, which owe their existences today to the safe keeping of the worms.\u201d).Then one day, you don\u2019t think about them. And you don\u2019t see or think about earthworms for 20 years. And even though it rains at the usual times of year, you don\u2019t notice the earthworms lying in the pool. They are invisible to you. You don\u2019t see that one bit every earthworm has that makes them look as though they are two earthworms taped together.If they\u2019re not drowning in pools, they are meeting another watery end: in the mouths of a fish after being twisted on to hooks. To get lots of earthworms for fishing, some people use the ancient ways of worm charming, which, uncharmingly, is sometimes also called worm grunting or worm fiddling. This is done by pushing a wooden stake into the ground, then rubbing a metal bar against it at just the right angle so that it vibrates.This makes the worms think there is a mole tunnelling around nearby and they squirm to the surface to escape it, like a cartoon character ducking behind a corner while its enemy keeps running straight.People have also grunted using chainsaws. But this is because \u2013 as explained \u2013 they have not thought properly about earthworms since they were 10. The best worm charmer in the world was 10.

Photograph: VisitBritain/Britain on View/Getty ImagesFor once, more recent history outweighs the longer established, hereabouts. In 1869, an Anglican Benedictine monk, Father Ignatius Lyne (1837-1908), bought land here and had a monastery built. Its situation is idyllic, nestling into the vertiginous morning-sun hillside of Tarren yr Esgob, looking up the valley of Nant Bwch where ring ouzels arrive in spring across blackthorn-studded slopes and nest by waterfalls in the mountain stream, drawing attention to their presence by scudding flight and plaintive calls finely attuned to the wild slopes they inhabit.Artists and writers congregated notably in the Vale of Ewyas between the wars. The sculptor Eric Gill, of ill repute, was among them. The poet and painter David Jones (1895-1974) joined him there while recovering from experiences on the western front so finely depicted in his 1937 masterpiece In Parenthesis. Other writers had preceded them here. The diarist Francis Kilvert strode over from Clyro, and recorded an impression of Capel-y-Ffin as \u201csquatting like a stout grey owl among its seven great black yews\u201d before striding home before dark. In 1807, the writer Walter Savage Landor (1775-1864) bought Llanthony Priory, lured by its glow-worms and nightingales.

Only around 4% of males become beachmasters.A male beachmaster is flanked by females on a beach. Photograph: Dr Mark HindellThe researchers believe the competitive pressures on maturing males drive them to gain weight as quickly as possible, resulting in lower survival rates because the males forage at sea in areas that may put them at higher risk of predation. \u201cAdult males concentrate their foraging effort in shallower waters.

Last week the state, along with Nevada and California, agreed to significant cutbacks in the use of water from the Colorado River, which is rapidly shrinking.The farmers dealing with water shortages even before historic Colorado River dealRead moreArizona, one of the driest states in the US, gets about a third of its water from the Colorado River, with approximately another 40% coming from groundwater sources. The state\u2019s recently concluded analysis projected a water shortfall of 4.86m acre-feet (6bn cubic meters) in the Phoenix area over the next 100 years. In response, the state said it will deny new certificates of Assured Water Supply, which enable home construction.Arizona has imposed such restrictions on other areas, and not all of greater Phoenix requires a certificate, but experts said the measure was certain to slow home-building in an area representing over half the state\u2019s population that has become a magnet for people in the US searching for affordable housing.\u201cIt\u2019s a reality check.

Many of those we treated were in a life-threatening condition. I sat by their beds as they writhed, struggling for air, their small bodies wracked with coughs. It is a kind of torture, to fear for your next breath. You can see the sheer terror in the children\u2019s eyes.NHS staff helped me survive losing my seven-year-old daughter to cancerRead moreIt\u2019s a horrible feeling \u2013 to wonder whether a child will make it through the night. In many cases the toxic drugs and steroids we give them aren\u2019t enough, and we have to breathe for them. Sometimes we have to put them into intensive care. Not all survive. And these are just the most obvious symptoms: studies show that air pollution is also detrimental to brain development in children, and can have adverse effects on unborn babies.We\u2019re in the middle of a public health crisis. Air pollution levels in London far outstrip legal limits, and it is worsening as the temperatures rise. Pollen also rises with the temperatures, and dangerous pollutants \u2013 such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) \u2013 congeal with pollens to create \u201csuper-pollens\u201d that can be deadly. This noxious cocktail is claiming the lives of children across London, particularly those who live near busy roads or in low-lying areas; 24% of London\u2019s primary schools are in areas that breach the legal limits on NOx.Every year, air pollution kills 40,000 people across Britain. Roughly a quarter of these deaths happen in London. Our politicians treat this as an abstract figure \u2013 maybe they think it\u2019s just a few years knocked off the end of life. They are wrong. The suffering is visceral. The deaths are real \u2013 we see them happening in front of our eyes. No one can fully appreciate how serious this is until they hold a wheezing infant in their arms.My crowded children\u2019s ward might seem like a medical problem, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a political problem. Our politicians are too reluctant to put up the right legislation or enforce the laws we do have.As mayor of London, Boris Johnson ignored the crisis. We see the consequences of this inaction each night in A&E. Sadiq Khan\u2019s plan for London is a step in the right direction. He put a \u00a310 charge on the most toxic vehicles entering the city, promises to raise emissions standards for diesel vehicles by next year, and wants to start phasing out diesel buses. But, frankly, this is not good enough.

There\u2019s no reason that London shouldn\u2019t beat them to it. The financial incentives are strong. Air pollution costs Britain more than \u00a320bn each year. Even the most aggressive regulatory action will cost us only a fraction of that total.It would take immense pressure off our NHS. And it would save tens of thousands of lives each year.

One of the rules is that debt has to be falling as a percentage of GDP.\u201cI\u2019m confident. We\u2019re talking about where we might be in 2027. So being a careful and cautious former lawyer, I know that the world can change. Four or five years ago, we didn\u2019t know we were going to hit Covid or Ukraine.

Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, announced in 2021 that this would be achieved in part by the government spending \u00a328bn a year until 2030 on technologies such as battery power and electric vehicles.In recent months, however, Reeves and Starmer have dialled down the ambition of the plan. Reeves announced last year a Labour government would only hit the \u00a328bn target in the second half of a parliament, and would borrow less to avoid missing its fiscal targets.Starmer said on Thursday that the party would not borrow the full amount of money if it meant missing the debt target, but appeared to leave open the possibility he would tax more or find the money from other parts of government spending.His comments on Friday appear to confirm, however, that he is happy to miss the spending target to protect the debt rule.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The naturalist and broadcaster Chris Packham called for a halt to the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d expansion of the Scottish salmon farming industry, as the Guardian revealed farmed salmon mortality was at record levels. Most salmon bought in UK supermarkets are farmed.Chris Packham calls for halt to \u2018catastrophic\u2019 expansion of Scottish salmon farmsRead moreAnd earlier this month, an expert assessment of wild fish populations found nearly a quarter at risk of extinction, with wild Atlantic salmon increasingly threatened.So, what are the fish to ditch in 2024 and what should we eating?\u201cUnsustainable seafood is one of the biggest threats to our seas,\u201d says Charlotte Coombes, good fish guide manager at the Marine Conservation Society (MCS). The guide\u2019s latest edition, in October, awarded only one in eight UK fish the highest \u201cgreen\u201d status and considered only 13% a sustainable choice.Consumers should ask \u201cwhat, where and how\u201d, says Coombes \u2013 what species, where it was caught and how. A simple start, she suggests, would be to swap the \u201cbig five\u201d for other seafood.Britons eat, on average, one serving of fish a week, 80% of which is made up of just five species. Cod and haddock, the staple of fish and chip dinners, is the most common choice, followed by salmon, tuna and prawns.A simple \u201cswap\u201d would reduce the pressure on this handful of preferred favourites, Coombes says, reducing the demand that drives unsustainable fishing and farming practices.Swap shop \u2013 what to buy instead of the big five1. CodOne of the UK\u2019s favourites, cod is a cold water species, generally wild-caught, but they have been struggling as sea temperatures rise. UK populations are doing very badly and should be avoided, MCS says. The good news is, North Sea populations are starting to increase due to fishing restrictions, but the stock is not yet sustainable.Sustainable swap Hake, certified by the Marine Stewardship Council\u2019s (MSC) blue tick, is now a sustainable choice, thanks to good management and environmental conditions, says the MCS guide.Hake is a sustainable alternative to overfished chip shop favourite cod. Photograph: Mark Wiener/Alamy2. HaddockAlso a chip shop favourite, haddock is generally a sustainable, wild-caught fish. But some populations are running low and haddock often swim in the same waters as cod, leading to haddock fisheries catching both species. Avoid fish less than 30cm in length and buying fresh during the March and April breeding season, MCS says.Best choice Haddock from the North Sea, Scotland, Iceland or Norway, or MSC-certified.Sustainable swap Plaice from the North Sea, where populations are thriving.3. SalmonWild Atlantic salmon populations are 23% down globally and have vanished from many UK rivers. The species has been affected by widespread habitat loss, global heating and dams. Breeding with escaped farmed salmon also threatens many wild populations. Sea lice from salmon farms are also a problem. Wild Atlantic salmon is now classified as \u201cnear threatened\u201d, and should be avoided, according to the fish guide.Best choice Pacific wild salmon (pink, red or keta) from Alaska. Organic or salmon certified by a green tick from the Aquaculture Stewardship Council, MCS says.Sustainable swap Farmed rainbow trout from UK ponds is a good alternative, MCS says.4. TunaThis top predator can grow up to three metres in length. There are many different species and MCS recommends checking its Good Fish Guide to see which are more sustainable. Avoid Pacific and Southern bluefin tuna, Indian Ocean yellowfin and tuna caught by gillnets or drift nets.Best choice Skipjack or albacore tuna caught by pole and line or trolls, artificial lures on barb-free lines with minimal bycatch.Sustainable swap Sardines from south-west England.5. PrawnsSourced from all over the world, prawns can be sustainable, depending on species, where and how they are caught.Best choice Wild cold-water prawns from the north-east Arctic. Farmed prawns labelled organic or with an MSC or ASC label, according to the fish guide. Creel-caught Scottish langoustines.Avoid Uncertified farmed king and tiger prawns from Vietnam, Indonesia or India.Sustainable swap Mussels: UK, rope-grown mussels are among the most ocean-friendly seafood, the fish guide says.",

        "text": "Their \u201cguerrilla protests\u201d on Britain\u2019s roads, at art galleries, museums, and cultural and sporting events have enraged the press, politicians and the public alike. But now experts have said they believe climate activists\u2019 most important weapon could be \u201cthe strategic use of nonviolent disruptive tactics\u201d.Nearly seven in 10 of academics surveyed rated disruptive protest tactics as \u201cat least quite important\u201d to success of a movement, ranking it as more important than gaining media coverage or even strictly avoiding violent tactics.The findings will boost the morale of climate activists, often derided as \u201ceco-zealots\u201d causing chaos for \u201chardworking people\u201d. The results also contradict public opinion: polling by YouGov in February shows the vast majority (78%) of Britons think disruptive protest hinders activists\u2019 causes.The findings come as Just Stop Oil\u2019s supporters complete their 12th week of slow marching protests on London\u2019s streets and amid uproar about lengthy queues at Wimbledon, where security was tightened to counter climate protests.James \u00d6zden, director of Social Change Lab, the protest thinktank that organised the survey, said: \u201cWe were really struck by the contradiction between what the public and media say about disruptive protests and what academics said. The experts who study social movements not only believe that strategic disruption can be an effective tactic, but that it is the most important tactical factor for a social movement\u2019s success.\u201cThis points out how our intuitions can be flawed when it comes to understanding social change, and how we shouldn\u2019t take people\u2019s first reactions as the indicator of an effective protest.\u201dApollo Surveys, which specialises in academic surveys, polled 120 experts in sociology, political science and related disciplines for Social Change Lab, asking them what makes some social movements more successful than others.Protest groups, in particular climate activists, have in recent years escalated the scale and frequency of disruptive protests. Just Stop Oil has staged slow march protests in London almost daily for the past 12 weeks, while also targeting high-profile events such as Wimbledon, Pride, the Ashes, the Glyndebourne festival and the Premiership rugby final.In each case, they have provoked public and political backlash, but experts said that despite that, their protests could make a difference. One survey respondent, Louisa Parks, associate professor of sociology at University of Trento, in Italy, said: \u201cIf we are talking about the long-term effects to disruptive climate justice protests, broader cultural changes could be provoked despite short-term backfire effects.\u201cThe example of soup-throwing or the recent protests by Last Generation in a number of European countries are all sophisticated comments on what we as a society protect and value, and what we don\u2019t. But it might take time to get through the outrage.\u201dAnother respondent, Prof Bart Cammaerts, professor of politics and communication at the London School of Economics, said: \u201cWhether we like it or not, the history of social change is also a history of political contestation and disruption. Disruption of everyday life is often the best way to receive media attention, generate visibility for a cause and above all to push political and economic elites to compromise and accept change, if only to protect their own interests.\u201dBut disruption was not a tactic that could be relied on by all causes, the experts said. While about seven in 10 said movements that have high public awareness and support, such as climate crisis organisations, could enjoy its fruits, only 30% thought disruptive tactics were effective for issues with high awareness but low support, such as anti-vaccination.The survey contained a number of other lessons for activists. According to experts, the most important governance and organisational factor for a social movement\u2019s success was the ability to \u201cmobilise and scale quickly in response to external events\u201d. They added that having decentralised decision making was the least important.Meanwhile, the most important internal factors that threatened social movement success were \u201cinternal conflict or movement infighting\u201d and a \u201clack of clear political objectives\u201d.Responding to the findings, James Skeet, a Just Stop Oil spokesperson, said: \u201cThere are two strands to civil resistance. One is disruption and the next is dialogue. Time and again, we see that public disruption is necessary to spark the conversations that result in much needed political pressure.\u201cPublic disruption elicits outrage that sparks discourse, and though people may \u2018shoot the messengers\u2019 the social science is clear that society, in part, hears the message. For example, after the highly controversial Insulate Britain campaign in 2021, mentions of housing insulation in the British press more than doubled. We now have a cross-parliamentary committee calling for a \u2018wartime effort\u2019 on insulation.\u201cThese sorts of tactics are uncomfortable for everyone concerned, but sadly this is how social change works.\u201d",

While commercial poultry feed contains primarily crops, chickens are also fed fishmeal and fish oil.The US, Brazil and China are the world\u2019s largest producers of both chicken and chicken feed, while the largest producers of salmon feed are Peru, Norway and Chile.In the future, the researchers noted, an expected increase in the price of fishmeal would raise \u201cthe question of whether the demand for land or marine feed resources are more sustainable, particularly given shifting diets and consumer preferences\u201d.\u201cFood is one of the biggest environmental pressures to the planet and we\u2019re all trying to be more conscious about what we\u2019re eating,\u201d Kuempel said.\u201cAnything that requires feed is going to have a higher environmental footprint than things that are not fed,\u201d she added. \u201cMany other studies have shown that being vegetarian and vegan are usually better options, and even things like [some] shellfish that don\u2019t have these feed ingredients have lower environmental pressures.\u201dScientists hope emerging research into new types of animal feeds \u2013 such as microalgae and insects \u2013 may help to reduce the dependence on fishmeal and oil and make aquaculture more sustainable.\u201cSince salmon is a premium product, they are looking more into these novel feeds and how they can decrease the feed conversion ratio \u2013 how much feed you put in versus how much you get out,\u201d Kuempel said.\u201cSalmon is already quite efficient \u2013 so around one tonne of feed that you put in, you get the same amount out. But using these novel feeds, you can perhaps get better nutrition for the animal while also decreasing your footprint.\u201dThe study did not take into account the sources of fish oil and fishmeal, which are often derived from seafood waste. This may have affected the environmental footprint calculations, Kuempel noted",

It has since dropped further.The Greens\u2019 healthy oceans spokesperson, Senator Peter Whish-Wilson, said the structure should have been removed when the project ceased operating.\u201cIt is disgraceful and unacceptable that four years have passed with Woodside failing to clean up its mess,\u201d Whish-Wilson said on Thursday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our health and wellbeing should be the core of planning and policymaking.\u201dHer review, published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine,highlights evidence of improvements in air pollution from many low emission zone (LEZ) schemes. More than 320 LEZs now operate across the UK and Europe to curb the use of the most polluting vehicles. It also reports a 6-9% reduction in the traffic pollution in and around a low traffic neighbourhood in London and up to 25% decreases from Barcelona\u2019s \u201csuper blocks\u201d, where accessibility and pedestrians are prioritised over cars.Separate research by Imperial College London also found clear reduction in heart and circulatory problems in five out of eight LEZ studies. These included fewer admissions to hospital, fewer deaths from heart attacks and strokes, and fewer people with blood pressure problems. Out of five studies that looked at lung health, two found improvements and the remainder showed no definite result. None showed a clear deterioration.Prof Mark Nieuwenhuijsen from the research institute ISGlobal, who led the new policy review, said: \u201cAir pollution policies often focus on legal compliance and forget that the primary aim is to prevent disease and maintain health. They rely too much on technical solutions and miss the additional health benefits from shifting private car use to public transport, cycling and walking.\u201dA five-year study of 260,000 working people in the UK has found that people who cycled to work were healthier and living longer than those who commuted by car. Along with people who walked to work, cycling commuters also had lower rates of heart disease.Putting public money into local amenities such as shops, schools, healthcare and social spaces such as parks, pubs and restaurants can create opportunities to walk, cycle or use public transport for the things we do every day. This is at the heart of the modern 15-minute city concept. It was also the pattern for villages, towns and cities before the second half of the 20th century.\u201cCreating environments where every essential is within a 15-minute walk or bike ride fosters consistent physical activity. This diminishes risks associated with a sedentary lifestyle and elevates air quality,\u201d according to Prof Carlos Moreno of Universit\u00e9 Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne, who was not involved in the new review.It is not just health that is improved, according to Moreno, who says the low-traffic designs also amplify quality of life and wellbeing. \u201cThey champion green spaces and shared communal areas, nurturing the mental health of residents and strengthening communal ties.\u201dDespite the evidence of their benefits, these projects can get caught up in political controversy. Nieuwenhuijsen said: \u201cOften the problem is the absence of a shared vision of a better city, no clear rational such as better respiratory health, and pathways to get there. Too often citizens think that restrictions and costs are imposed by a city council to pester them. We need more co-creation and engagement to create and implement a vision of a sustainable, livable and healthy city.\u201d This article was amended on 20 October 2023.

It contributes about 3% of global emissions but this could rise significantly if no action is taken.The international tribunal for the law of the sea has been asked by a group of island nations to give its opinion on the climate crisis and marine responsibilities. Like the international court of justice, which was tasked with giving its view on states\u2019 legal duties on the climate emergency earlier this year, the tribunal\u2019s opinion will not be legally binding, but it will be highly influential.In its submission to the tribunal, seen by the Guardian, the NGO Opportunity Green argues that the law of the sea already obliges all countries to combat vessel pollution and therefore hold the shipping industry accountable for its greenhouse gas emissions.Carly Hicks, the legal director of Opportunity Green, said states had largely delegated their environmental responsibilities over shipping to the IMO. Last year, the UN body finally agreed that some form of action was needed and said that would include a market-based economic element, such as a levy, cap and trade scheme or a reward system, and a technical element, most likely a global fuel standard.There is growing support for the idea of a levy among states and the shipping industry.

Its deputy secretary general, Simon Bennett, told the Guardian: \u201cThe UNFCCC [United Nations framework convention on climate change] has quite clearly given the mandate to the IMO to regulate shipping permissions \u2013 as it has with aviation \u2013 primarily because it\u2019s very difficult to attribute the emissions from shipping to one particular country.\u201dPressure will continue to grow after the leaders\u2019 summit being held in Paris this week, where heads of state are considering how a levy on shipping could raise money to supplement climate finance.With promises by wealthy governments to provide $100bn (\u00a378bn) a year in climate finance to poorer countries still falling far short, a variety of innovative ways of raising cash are being discussed, to fund climate mitigation and adaptation and tackle the growing problem of loss and damage around the world.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who is co-hosting the summit, is understood to support a shipping levy as the most advanced option on the table.",

Aemo downplayed the impact of the closure of the Liddell power station in the New South Wales Hunter Valley in April, saying black coal-fired plants actually offered more output for the quarter.Eastern Australia hit with rising electricity prices despite record warm weatherRead moreThe rise of renewable energy, particularly rooftop solar, increasingly nudged out fossil fuels from the grid. Both black and brown coal power plants reported lower utilisation rates during the quarter.\u201cIncreased market share of lower marginal-cost renewables helped push down the wholesale electricity cost from [the June quarter of] 2022, despite this quarter having the highest Q2 underlying demand recorded since 2016,\u201d said Violette Mouchaileh, an Aemo executive general manager.\u201cRooftop solar generation increased 30% from Q2 2022,\u201d Mouchaileh said. \u201cCoupled with higher renewable output, wholesale prices were zero or negative [for] 9% of the quarter throughout the NEM, a new Q2 record.\u201dThe electricity industry remains Australia\u2019s biggest source of greenhouse emissions but has more competitive low-carbon alternatives than other sectors. During the quarter, emissions from the NEM \u2013 which serves about 80% of the population \u2013 dropped 6.6% from a year earlier to 28.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nAemo\u2019s report covers most of the trends highlighted by the Australian Energy Regulator a week ago. It carries, though, more detail about emissions and prices.Power prices started to soar about a year ago after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine triggered sanctions and then a scramble by buyers for non-Russian energy supplies. Black coal and gas prices soared globally, prompting the Australian government to impose domestic price limits for both to help limit the leap in electricity prices.The energy minister, Chris Bowen, said the year-on-year drop in wholesale prices was \u201cin no small part due to the Albanese government\u2019s immediate intervention to cap coal and gas prices \u2013 which the LNP opposed and said they will repeal\u201d.East coast gas prices during the June quarter remained elevated.

That tally was down a third from the June quarter of 2022 and the lowest output for any April-June period since 2006, Aemo said.Overall, power prices were less volatile without the repeat of the June 2022 energy crisis when a lack of available coal plants combined with cold weather and fewer windy days. Wholesale power prices exceeded $300 a MWh for about a quarter of the trading intervals during the June quarter of 2022 and just 3% of them in the quarter that just ended.For the quarter, rooftop solar increased its proportion of the market by 1.8 percentage points, grid solar expanded by 1.4 points, wind 1.6 points and brown coal 0.2 points. Gas lost 3.2 percentage points, hydro 1.2 points and black coal shrank its share by 0.6 points.All up the fossil-fuel plants contributed about 64.4% of NEM supply in the quarter, down from almost 68% in the June quarter last year.The share of renewables might have advanced even more if not for limits on grid capacity. About 61MW of generation on average was lost from solar and windfarms for the quarter, up from 41MW a year earlier.",

The ever-increasing signs of climate collapse make for heart-thumping reading, while our daily dose of record-breaking temperatures, severe water shortages and crop failure only add to the litany of looming disaster. Yet we continue with the model of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d because those in whom power and money are entrenched wish to keep them so.So, what can the majority of us, who continue to bear the brunt, actually do? Protest just invites a prison sentence, while getting the media to invest a few words in the subject is seemingly impossible. Our most effective, and indeed possibly our only, tool for effecting meaningful change is our freedom to vote \u2013 all the way from local authority to national government \u2013 but with time fast running out we need those in power to be making those changes without further prevarication. Wherever you are, please use your vote wisely, because all our futures may hang on this tenuous thread.Nick MacIneskarTayvallich, Argyll and Bute It\u2019s even worse than George Monbiot says. It\u2019s not just the 1% or 2% dictating the conversation and policies. There\u2019s a swathe of 25%\u201140% of people in the developed world who recognise the issues and impending outcomes, but go along with the status quo in order not to take a short-term hit to consumption standards. This group is ambivalent, and ambivalence in a crisis supports inaction and failure.Also, those on the fringes working to forestall and perhaps reverse the effects of climate change need to work to change the message. The object is not to save the planet. In other epochs, this planet was fine as a burning ball of methane, and it was fine as a frozen ball of ice. As the author notes, it\u2019s the \u201chabitability\u201d for humans that needs to be preserved/restored; the climate range that allowed humans to develop and prosper. The planet doesn\u2019t need saving. It will endure. It\u2019s the people on Earth who are endangered.D Scott McDougallBoise, Idaho, United States George Monbiot\u2019s excellent piece on the growing fragility of our food system under accelerating global heating blames the plutocrats and their greed for humanity\u2019s failure to address global heating. However, one sentence leapt out at me: \u201cCan you imagine, in decades to come, trying to explain this to your children?\u201dIf Monbiot is right and the food system collapses, the only group with the resources to get enough food for their children \u201cin decades to come\u201d will be the plutocrats, and they are not going to tell their children \u201cit was our fault\u201d.

The legislation is based on the incorrect premise that Meta benefits unfairly from news content shared on our platforms, when the reverse is true.\u201dHow has the ban affected communication for communities hit by wildfires?With more than 200 fires burning across the Northwest Territories, officials have ordered 20,000 residents of the city of Yellowknife to evacuate, the first time such an order has been made for a Canadian capital.But residents of the city have said the lack of news links on Facebook and Instagram means accurate information about the wildfires and evacuation is hard to access on social media.Officials have said misinformation about the fires is rife on Facebook.

Other species were found to be increasing in body size, such as plants in the Arctic.Scientists are still researching the causes of such changes in body sizes, some of which exceed 10%, but they have suggested it may be the consequence of global heating and overconsumption \u2013 defining features of the Anthropocene, the proposed term for our geological epoch that describes humanity\u2019s impact on the Earth.The report supports other findings about shrinking fish sizes in the North Sea and smaller Pacific salmon in Alaska, which some researchers believe is linked to the climate crisis.The thorny skate is among the fish that have become smaller. Photograph: Poelzer Wolfgang/AlamyThe study, published in the journal Science, was carried out by an international team of scientists from 17 universities, compiling data on 4,292 mammals, invertebrates, plants, fish, amphibians and reptiles,including a range of seabed species.The lead researcher, Dr In\u00eas Martins from York University, said: \u201cThe core finding is that the body size is not just predominantly shrinking but that organisms are becoming smaller through a combination of species replacement and changes within species populations.\u201cWithin some species, individuals are becoming smaller and smaller. And larger species are being replaced by smaller ones when they disappear.\u201cThese trends were most evident among fish, where we saw clear evidence of shrinking body size. For other organisms, we have less data available and we don\u2019t really see any changes from the average [but] it is unquestionable that we are observing quite big changes in biodiversity and the type of biodiversity we find in different places,\u201d she said.Small numbers of large organisms were being replaced by many smaller ones, keeping the biomass constant, according to the paper, supporting the idea that ecosystems compensate for changes.Unlocking a river: rare silver fish returns to its ancient spawning grounds \u2013 in picturesRead moreA senior author of the paper, Prof Maria Dornelas of St Andrews University, said: \u201cWe think this suggests that, when large organisms disappear, other ones try to take up their place and use up the resources that become available.\u201cRecognising and exploring this complexity is imperative if we want to understand the mechanisms involved in how body size is changing through time,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s clear the widespread species replacement we see around the world is having measurable consequences. Organisms becoming smaller has important effects as the size of animals mediates their contribution to how ecosystems function, and how humans benefit from them \u2013 bigger fish can usually feed more people than smaller fish,\u201d she said.Dr Franziska Schrodt, a co-author from Nottingham University, said: \u201cUnfortunately, we currently lack data on many organisms other than fish to draw clear conclusions \u2013 future research will benefit from a greater investment in these kinds of measurements, particularly when exploring food webs and other species interactions.\u201dFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

I stood staring at these shapes for around 10 minutes,\u201d says Lowery, a volunteer fossil hunter.She reached down and placed her hand into one of the shapes. \u201cIt was a moment of pure joy and total wonder as I realised that I had found some footprints.\u201dDinosaur skull found in Queensland belonged to sauropod that roamed almost 100m years agoRead moreWhat Lowery had found on the rocky flats at low tide was what scientists say is the oldest known evidence for ancient birds in the southern hemisphere \u2013 impressions of footprints that have survived for between 120m and 128m years.The discovery of the 27 bird tracks \u2013 initially thought to have been made by dinosaurs \u2013 are at a spot that would have been close to the south pole and part of the Gondwana super-continent that included Antarctica when they were made.Prof Anthony Martin, a palaeontologist at Emory University in Atlanta, was sent pictures of the tracks by Lowery after she found them in the summer of 2000.A footprint among the 27 fossilised bird tracks found in Victoria.

Within a couple of days, he was convinced Lowery\u2019s dinosaur tracks were actually bird footprints.\u201cAs an avid bird watcher for many years, to hear that I had found the footprints of birds was absolutely amazing,\u201d says Lowery, who volunteers for Dinosaur Dreaming, a joint project between Museums Victoria, Monash University and Swinburne University of Technology looking for dinosaur evidence.Martin used a checklist to distinguish the tracks as birds, including how the prints had three forward-facing widely spread toes at an angle greater than 90 degrees, with sharp claws and some with a distinctive claw for perching.The birds had possibly migrated there for the spring or summer and were likely about the same size as a modern-day heron or oystercatcher.Melissa Lowery (centre) with palaeontologist Patricia Vickers-Rich (left) and Peter Swinkels, who cast the bird footprints, at the discovery site.

And it has a tail, with no tail feathers. You would see it\u2019s a transitional animal from its dinosaur ancestors.\u201dMartin says the tracks are the earliest evidence of birds in Australia, the southern hemisphere and the ancient Gondwana continent.\u201cThis shows us when birds arrived there. We think birds originated about 160 to 150 million years ago in the northern hemisphere,\u201d he says.The previous earliest known evidence for birds in Australia was from a 105m-year-old fossilised bone also found close to the site of the tracks. The first Australian dinosaur fossil was discovered at the same site in 1903.The footprints are only visible at low tide but are being eroded by the daily tides. Over the course of 18 months, the study says seven of the tracks had been erased, but not before photographs and casts were made.Another footprint among the ancient bird tracks.

A bone can move, but a footprint can\u2019t. When you find dinosaurs and bird footprints together, you know they were contemporaneous.\u201dRich has been studying the site with his wife, Patricia Vickers-Rich, of Monash University, for about 40 years.

        "text": "George Monbiot\u2019s summary of the planetary science of climate heating, nature destruction and Earth system collapse this century, and the disintegration of civilised society, is excellent (The \u2018flickering\u2019 of Earth systems is warning us: act now, or see our already degraded paradise lost, 31 October). My only caveat is his repeated use of the word \u201ccould\u201d, which overeggs the possibility of an alternative future where the biospheric tipping points into catastrophe are avoided.Even if human carbon emissions and destructive developments in primary nature miraculously cease tomorrow, the planet will continue to heat because releases from natural sources will not stop. They include carbon and methane from permafrost and gas hydrates in shallow polar waters, collapsing forests and wetlands, increased water vapour, and the loss of reflective albedo from polar and mountain ice melt, meaning further atmospheric and ocean warming etc. That is the \u201cdoom loop\u201d.Every tenth of a degree less matters. The reason I wake up an optimist is that George\u2019s vanishing possibility to escape the loop can be achieved by four new, interactive global cooperatives:(1) Scientists, ecologists and their professional associations uniting in repeated condemnation of the global institutions \u2013 and political, corporate and media groups in every society \u2013 who create this hell on earth, and explaining to populations what must be changed.(2) Thousands of NGOs uniting to use their multibillion-dollar budgets, and millions of staff and volunteers, to mobilise their memberships as voters, consumers and shareholders to \u201cthrow the bums out of office\u201d, back climate- and nature-positive tax, spend and regulatory policies, and patronise green enterprises and investment.(3) Thousands of idealists behind the artificial intelligence revolution uniting to design non-proprietary, humanity-enhancing solutions to cooling our planet, adapting to unavoidable impacts, and developing extreme-weather-resistant, gene-edited food\u00a0crops.(4) Young people everywhere uniting to build a cooperative political economy based on life-enhancing planet management.Charles SecrettBrighton George Monbiot mentions the Permian extinction 252m years ago. However, there are major differences between then and now:(1) The rate we are approaching the next one is about 1,000 times faster than the last time, when humans didn\u2019t exist. Nature magazine recognised this years ago.(2) It was indeed the mother of all mass extinctions so far, but now at the faster rate, it is equal to the IPCC emissions scenario known as RCP 8.5. Though for perhaps obvious reasons climate scientists seem anxious not to refer to this, jaw-droppingly it is the emissions path we are still on at this time.Aubrey MeyerBelfast It is worth emphasising that, even if anthropogenic global warming wasn\u2019t happening, the Earth would be still facing a sixth mass extinction event purely through our destruction of species, habitats, and whole ecosystems. The rapidity of this wildlife mass extinction event is unprecedented.Angus DaviesBruton, Somerset In the 2030s, 40s or 50s, when the climate crisis has manifested itself in global catastrophe, some wretched politician will be running round in circles whimpering: \u201cNobody told us it would be this bad.\u201d We can then all point to this article by George Monbiot and say: \u201cYes, you were told.

My Labour government will rise above short-termist gimmicks, put the country before our party, and deliver the long-term future of our energy industry.\u201dThe oil industry lobbying group Offshore Energy UK (OEUK) says it is committed to a long-term transition to net zero but has embraced Sunak\u2019s decision to license extraction in the Rosebank oil and gas field, the North Sea\u2019s largest untapped field.OEUK is pressing the government to support another \u00a3100bn in new North Sea investments, to replace the 180 fields it predicts will stop producing oil in the next decade. Climate scientists are adamant that doing so will sabotage global efforts to prevent runaway climate heating.Starmer is understood to have argued in the roundtable that while oil and gas will still play a role in UK energy supply, a partnership was required between industry, unions and government to shift quickly on to zero-carbon technologies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It also plans to invest in upgrading major ports around the UK, arguing that is a far wiser strategic investment than the freeports Sunak has vowed to create.Starmer\u2019s engagement with oil executives carries political risks but also recognises the significance of persuading the industry to accept the case for rapidly meeting the UK\u2019s net zero targets, both for the general election and meeting Labour\u2019s manifesto commitments.Sunak has made clear he plans to frame Labour\u2019s approach as a \u201cwar on motorists\u201d and will accuse Starmer of destroying valuable North Sea jobs. Labour hopes voters, union leaders and oil workers will accept the urgency of the climate argument, and that Starmer\u2019s strategy will also help it outflank the Scottish National party at the next election.Floating offshore windfarms will provide much cheaper clean electricity but there are substantial reservations about how significant a role carbon capture and mass-produced hydrogen can play in the clean energy transition.",

Not everyone is happyRead moreBut only time will tell whether the US Fish and Wildlife Service can succeed in finding a suitable mate for the female wolf numbered F2754. The newly captured wolf will be offered a choice among two brothers that are also housed at the federal government\u2019s wolf management facility in central New Mexico.\u201cWe wanted to bring her in earlier so that she has a longer chance to bond with a mate and then hopefully successfully breed,\u201d said an agency spokeswoman, Aislinn Maestas. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be observing her and waiting to see. Hopefully, she does show interest in one or the other.\u201dIt could be late February or early March before biologists know if their efforts are successful.It has been 25 years since Mexican gray wolves were first reintroduced into the south-western US. Through captive breeding and targeted releases, wildlife managers have been able to build up the population of what is the rarest subspecies of gray wolf in North America.Despite fits and starts, the numbers have trended upward, with last year marking the most Mexican gray wolves documented in Arizona and New Mexico since the start of the program.Federal and state wildlife managers had been tracking the lone female wolf for months, waiting for an opportunity to capture her again. Her journey began in the mountains of south-eastern Arizona and crossed the dusty high desert of central New Mexico before reaching the edge of Valles Caldera national preserve.She spent weeks moving between the preserve and the San Pedro Mountains. After showing no signs of returning to the wolf recovery area, officials decided to capture her before the start of the breeding season.US Fish and Wildlife Service shows game camera footage of wolf F2754 before her epic journey. Photograph: APTheir opportunity came on Saturday near the rural community of Coyote, New Mexico. A helicopter crew working with the New Mexico game and fish department shot her with a tranquilizer dart and then readied her for the trip south to the Sevilleta Wolf Management Facility.It was about the wellbeing of the wolf, said Brady McGee, the Mexican wolf recovery coordinator.\u201cDispersal events like this are often in search of a mate. As there are no other known wolves in the area, she was unlikely to be successful and risked being mistaken for a coyote and shot,\u201d he said in a statement.Officials said the goal is that the match-making efforts net pups in the spring and more wolves can be released to boost the wild population.The recovery area spanning Arizona and New Mexico is currently home to more than 240 of the endangered predators. There is also a small population in Mexico.Environmentalists had pushed federal managers to let the solo female wolf be, pointing out that previous efforts to relocate her were unsuccessful following her first attempt to head northward last winter. They also pointed out that the wolf\u2019s movements were evidence that the recovery boundaries were insufficient to meet the needs of the expanding population.\u201cI think what we can say is that we know wolves are driven towards dispersing as a way towards mating with non-related wolves. In the case of Mexican wolves, those unrelated mates are increasingly hard to come by because of the level of inbreeding in the population and the narrow band of Arizona and New Mexico where wolves are allowed to be,\u201d said Greta Anderson, deputy director of the Western Watersheds Project.Ranchers in New Mexico and Arizona have long complained that wolves are responsible for dozens of livestock deaths every year and remain concerned about any expansion of the wolves\u2019 range. Rural residents in Colorado are joining them as officials plan to release gray wolves there in the coming weeks.",

Today it has fewer than 100 residents. Locals said the mountain and the rocks on it had been moving since the last ice age, according to officials.Over the last century, the village itself has moved a few centimetres each year \u2013 but the movement has accelerated over the last 20 years, and the landslide has now been moving about one metre a year. Geological surveys suggest the situation has become even more precarious.Melting glaciers in Alps threaten biodiversity of invertebrates, says studyRead moreChristian Gartmann, a member of the crisis management board in the town of Albula, which counts Brienz in its municipality, said experts estimated there was a 60% chance that the rock would fall in smaller chunks, which may not even reach the village or the valley. It could also move slowly. But there was also a 10% chance the whole 2m cubic metres mass may tumble down \u2013 threatening lives, property and the village itself, he said.\u201cWe hope that the village stays intact,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cWe can\u2019t eliminate the possibility that it [the rock] will come down \u2026 It could damage the village or destroy it.\u201dGartmann said that glacier melt had affected the precariousness of the rocks over millennia but that glacier melt due to human-made climate change in recent decades was not a factor.Experts deemed that a controlled explosion to set off a rockslide was too dangerous because it would require drilling underneath the rock \u2013 itself a hazardous operation, Gartmann said. Erecting a giant pile of sand or a wall to try to block any spillage was not considered feasible, he said, adding that the wall would have to be at least 70 metres high to protect the village.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "On Tuesday, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) pleaded with governments to up the pace in reducing the world\u2019s dependence on oil and gas. A \u201cstrong signal to energy markets\u201d was needed, said Fatih Birol \u2013 one which indicated that governments are taking the climate seriously. Wealthy countries, he added, having disproportionately contributed to historical carbon emissions, bear a special responsibility as the climate begins to change at \u201cfrightening speed\u201d.On Wednesday Britain certainly sent out a signal. But it was hardly the one the IEA would have hoped for. Instead, the green light was given for the exploitation of the United Kingdom\u2019s largest untapped oilfield. The Rosebank project in the North Sea has the potential to deliver 500m barrels of oil, which, when burned, would emit the same amount of carbon dioxide as the running of 56 coal-fired power stations for a year. Tax incentives offered to the Norwegian energy company Equinor will effectively subsidise a development certain to undermine the country\u2019s credibility in future climate negotiations.About 80% of North Sea oil is sold abroad, giving the lie to ministerial arguments that this is about energy security for hard-pressed Britons. So why? The truth is that, as with the U-turns last week on net zero-related targets, Rishi Sunak is playing politics with the climate emergency. The prime minister calculates that, in the context of the cost of living crisis, the challenges of the green transition can become a wedge issue with Labour. For presumed short-term electoral gain, he is methodically disrupting a formerly broad consensus on climate commitments.Domestically, this cynical disregard for the UK\u2019s environmental responsibilities will leave future governments to pick up the pieces. That is deeply irresponsible. It is also to squander the possibilities of economic growth that come with the net zero timetable, which is defining the industrial parameters of the future. While fiscal inducements are deployed in the North Sea, undermining climate targets that command popular assent, insufficient government support this month caused off-shore wind sector growth to grind disastrously to a halt. A dismal combination of political opportunism and economic myopia is sabotaging Britain\u2019s green prospects.But it is on the global stage that the Rosebank decision will resonate most damagingly. Net zero sceptics on the British right like to point to the gulf in overall emissions between countries such as the UK and vast economies such as China and India. Yet the rest of the world is well aware of the historic role played by the industrialised west in creating the climate emergency. If countries such as the UK fail to lead the way in mitigating the damage done, the global cooperation required to limit temperature rises will be far harder to achieve. The journey to net zero is not just about statistics; it involves negotiating these political and ethical dynamics for the common good of the planet.In this context, the willingness of a backs-against-the-wall Conservative administration to max out on North Sea oil and gas sends a disastrous message. Two years ago, in an interview with the Guardian, Mr Birol said he feared that in relation to climate targets there was \u201ca huge and growing gap between the rhetoric [from governments] and the reality\u201d. Shamefully, it grew even wider on Wednesday in Britain.",

        "text": "British households will benefit from improved routes for recycling electronic goods from 2026, under government plans to have producers and retailers pay for household and in-store collections.Consumers would be able to have electrical waste (e-waste) \u2013 from cables to toasters and power tools \u2013 collected from their homes or drop items off during a weekly shop, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said in a consultation published on Thursday. The ambition is for retailers, rather than the taxpayer, to pick up the tab for these new ways of disposing of defunct, often toxic products safely. The measures are due to come into force in two years\u2019 time.Almost half a billion small electrical items ended up in landfill last year, according to data from the not-for-profit Material Focus. This problem was particularly acute during Christmas, when 500 tonnes of Christmas lights were thrown away, the government said.The latest proposals build on efforts to grapple with the issue that the UK helped develop as a member of the EU. This included the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive, which came into effect in 2012. As with other waste-related rules they follow a principle that the producer of the waste will foot the bill for its disposal, which the UK and EU have followed in areas such as plastic packaging.The EU this year adopted policy recommendations for member states to improve collection of recycled materials, although targets vary by country.Post-Brexit, the UK has failed to keep pace with some EU regulatory efforts. The bloc is attempting to reduce e-waste with laws including a right to repair products, and requiring common chargers for phones (USB C) rather than Apple\u2019s specialised lightning charger from 2024 onward. Cables, which are often hoarded as well as wrongly disposed of, are a major contributor to electronic waste.A lack of effective recycling capacity in areas such as battery processing has also left the UK lagging behind European peers on a range of recycling rates. An OECD study of British data shows it failed to meet its recycling targets for household e-waste from 2017 to 2020. The review by the economic thinktank found \u201cfurther efforts are needed\u201d for the UK to prevent illegal dumping and export of electronic waste including bringing in a proposed mandatory waste tracking system.The struggle to meet recycling targets comes despite Britain being one of the heaviest consumers of such items, according to a study by the consumer group U-Switch using data from the Global E-Waste Monitor report. The UK was second only to Norway for the amount of electrical waste it generates per person. Comparable data on electronic waste is patchy and needs improvement, MPs have warned.Measures aimed at easing the problem of electronic waste now include requiring larger retailers to create \u201ccollection drop points for electrical items in-store\u201d for free, and without the need to exchange this with a new purchase.From 2026 onward, bricks-and-mortar retailers and online sellers would have to collect any broken or rejected large electrical goods including fridges or cookers when they are delivering a replacement product, Defra said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But most of the broad-leaved trees that we know and love \u2013 the magnolias, plane trees, elms, beech, walnuts, limes, oaks, maples and horse chestnuts \u2013 made a calculated decision to drop their leaves come autumn. Large, soft leaves are hard to protect in the winter weather, so the trees evolved to lose them, but not their valuable resources.Leaf fall is a precision art for a deciduous tree \u2013 it\u2019s a salvage operation on the greatest scale as the tree works quickly to bank the resources hidden inside the pigments of the leaves. The greens of chlorophyll go first, then the yellows of the xanthonoids, and then the orange carotenoids, until all that is left is brown \u2013 at which point the tree lets its foliage go.But the spent leaves that flutter to the ground aren\u2019t a waste product. They are rich in carbon and play an essential role for the tree and the ecology it supports. The leaves act as a physical barrier for soil, keeping it and its many microbes insulated, and also for the tree roots, as the wet mats of autumn leaves shelter the fragile top layer from the drying winds.Many, many things live in these dead leaf layers: caterpillars of moths and butterflies, their chrysalises, beetles, centipedes, springtails, woodlice and spiders \u2026 and doesn\u2019t the blackbird know it, rustling through the leaves? Our song and garden birds want these meals far more than they do your imported peanuts.No one loves wet autumn leaves more than earthworms, though. Sensing one of their favourite things, they start to work on incorporating them into the soil. Earthworms line their homes with autumn leaves, using them for bedding and then, because they are good housekeepers, they eat them as they break down. This act brings all that rich carbon into the soil layer so that it is now digested and available for the rest of the food web \u2013 the microbes, fungal networks, the protozoa, amoebas, and all the other millions of weird and wonderful things that keep the soil alive.A soil made rich by this winter mulching and munching is a better aerated soil, so it can deal with winter and spring flooding \u2013 and with summer droughts.In light of all this work, I\u2019m getting behind the US\u2019s \u201cLeave the leaves\u201d campaign. Doesn\u2019t raking up leaves to put them in plastic bags seem a little ridiculous; doesn\u2019t the deafening roar of the leaf blower sound ludicrous? Do we really think we know better than trees? Leave the leaves be: they are not a mess, a waste or a hindrance \u2013 they are life and vital with it.If you must rake them up because they make the path to your front door too slippery or they have coated the lawn, then return them to the tree. Rake them back up to the base of the tree, tamp them down a little and leave them alone. If they are on a flower bed, leave them for the worms \u2013 they will, I promise, be gone by spring.If you must be tidy, at least make leaf mould. Rake up the leaves, pile them up in a chicken wire cage or old compost bags with a few extra holes in them (the fungi that break them down need plenty of oxygen) and rot them down for a season or two. The resulting leaf mould can be added back to the soil to condition it.But honestly, as wonderful as leaf mould is, you are still stealing food from the mouths of tiny things. It\u2019s work better done in place. Trust in nature: millions of years gives you time to work out how to get something right. Alys Fowler is a gardener and freelance writer",

It is also fundamental for us,\u201d she said.\u201cOur results suggest a level of consciousness [in chickens] that prompts discussions about animal rights and welfare.\u201dWriting in the journal Plos One, Hillemacher and colleagues note that roosters tend to call out to their peers should they see an aerial threat, such as a bird of prey. If a rooster is alone, however, it does not usually raise the alarm as it could draw the predator\u2019s attention.In their first set of experiments, the team placed a rooster in one of two sections of an indoor space. In the other section they placed either a mirror, another rooster, or left it empty.The team then projected the silhouette of a flying hawk on to the ceiling of the section containing the first rooster.The results from 58 roosters revealed the birds made far more alarm calls when another rooster was visible to them, with 1.33 alarm calls per bird on average over three tests, than when alone (0.29 calls on average) or faced with the mirror (0.43 calls on average). The team found a similar reduction in calls when they placed a second rooster out of sight behind the mirror.The team say the findings suggest the birds did not regard their reflection as another rooster, even when accompanied by the smell and sound of a second bird. While that may suggest roosters can recognise themselves in a mirror, the team say there is another possibility.\u201cIt\u2019s equally feasible that they regarded their reflection as an odd [member of their species] mimicking their every move, leading them not to emit an alarm call out of irritation,\u201d said Hillemacher.The researchers also used a traditional \u201cmark test\u201d to probe mirror self-recognition. In those experiments, 18 roosters had either pink or transparent powder dabbed just below their beak, on their chest \u2013 a place they cannot usually see. The birds\u2019 reactions were then recorded in the presence and absence of a mirror to explore if they saw and understood the mark was on their body \u2013 a revelation typically gauged by an animal\u2019s tendency to investigate the patch.The results revealed that while the birds touched and groomed themselves, their behaviour did not differ when a mirror was present, or if the mark was pink or transparent.The team say that their results suggest mirror tests should be modified to take into account the natural context of the animal being studied.They also note that with chickens possibly one of the least expected candidates for recognising their own reflection, the results have important implications.\u201cIf roosters can differentiate between their own reflection and the sight of a conspecific, it is likely that this cognitive ability is much more widespread than previously assumed,\u201d the team write.",

        "text": "For as long as the United Kingdom needs to use oil and gas, we should be making an effort to capture any resulting CO2 and store it. That clearly makes sense. It also makes sense to produce our own oil and gas, so we are less beholden to exporters (though of course ours, too, would be sold on the international markets).So far, so good for Rishi Sunak\u2019s twofold announcement today in Scotland. But it would be helpful if he did not muddy these waters by using them to score political points against Labour in the run-up to an election campaign. What we desperately need now, as we confront the climate crisis, is agreement on a way forward. Bringing party politics into it will only hinder progress.Of course, critics are right to say that where we buy our energy should not deflect attention from the urgent need to reduce demand for fossil fuels. But that issue is one of constraining overall demand, not arguing over the source of supply. Preferring to use only ship-borne oil to avoid the supposed taint of dirtying our hands in the North Sea would be hypocrisy.Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a separate issue. Like power from nuclear fusion, it is one of those solutions to the climate crisis that has always been just over the horizon. But as academics such as Oxford\u2019s Myles Allen and Edinburgh\u2019s Stuart Haszeldine have long argued, unlike fusion, the issue is not one of science and technology. It is one of politics and money. Norway\u2019s carbon capture operations in the North Sea have been running since 1996, and now store close to a million tonnes of CO2 every year. Denmark\u2019s first full-scale carbon capture and storage project was launched this summer, also in the North Sea. There is nothing new in Sunak\u2019s project other than it is British.Rishi Sunak says approving new licences for oil and gas drilling \u2018entirely consistent\u2019 with net zero plan \u2013 UK politics liveRead moreThis issue now is one of politics. Existing CCS currently reduces CO2 emissions by 0.1%. To meet net zero, it needs to rise to 10%. This requires a massive uplift of investment. At present, Sunak\u2019s commitment to the current Acorn project appears to be minimal, particularly in comparison to the reportedly \u201cunachievable\u201d and energy-guzzling HS2. But CCS has one advantage: that it could be largely financed through the marketplace by imposing the cost not on taxpayers, but on polluters direct. According to Haszeldine, all emitters of CO2 should themselves fund the capture and storage of one tonne of the gas for every tonne they emit. He estimates this would add probably 15p a litre to the price of petrol. Everyone \u2013 producers and consumers \u2013 would play their part.It is known in the energy world that the big corporations are waiting to be ordered to embark on CCS by a government with the guts to do it. That is perhaps why they have been building up cash reserves to obscene levels. It has to be right that those who produce pollutants should also dispose of them. There is no pretending that this will be cheap. But efforts to reduce global emissions piecemeal are reportedly failing even to approach net zero. There are clearly limits to how far the rich world will transform its lifestyle. The next great battle has to be direct action against CO2. That this would cost money can hardly be an objection: this is a crisis, after all.\nSimon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist\n",

This article was amended on 2 December 2023. An earlier version incorrectly gave the estimated upper temperature of the heated plasma as \u201c200mC\u201d. The figure has been amended to 200 million degrees celsius (200MC, or mega-degrees celsius).",

Any invasive fish caught in the reservoir will be sacrificed, in accordance with local regulations on exotic species, while any fish caught that are native to the area will be released into nearby waters.As many as 60 tonnes of fish could be living in the waters of the Sau, of which an estimated 80% are believed to be invasive species, said Jordi Ruiz of the regional government. \u201cIf we do nothing and it doesn\u2019t rain, the fish will die anyway, damaging the quality of the water,\u201d he said.The mass of invasive fish \u2013 which range from wels catfish to common carp and pike perch and are believed to have been introduced to the reservoir for sportfishing \u2013 are expected to be sent to a local business, which speculated that they could be used to create biodiesel or fertiliser, according to the newspaper El Peri\u00f3dico.Officials are also gradually transferring the remaining water to a nearby reservoir in order to minimise the risk that it could become contaminated as the reservoir is drained.\u201cIt\u2019s an extreme scenario,\u201d Elisabet Mas of the Catalan Water Agency told reporters on Monday. The reservoir was at about 10% of its capacity, or enough to meet the needs of a million residents for three months, she said. \u201cThe drought is exceptional and we have to take advantage of the few resources available.\u201dIt is not the first time that the Sau reservoir\u2019s dramatic fluctuations have made headlines. In August, receding waters exposed the ruins of an 11th-century church, offering a glimpse of the village that had been submerged in the 1960s in order to build a nearby dam.

Because there are so many insect species, this doubles the global number of species at risk, according to the paper, published in Plos One on Wednesday.Lead researcher, Axel Hochkirch, from the Mus\u00e9e National d\u2019Histoire Naturelle in Luxembourg, said: \u201cWhat our study does is really highlight that insects are as threatened as other taxa. And because they are the most species-rich group of animals on our planet, this is really something which should be addressed.\u201dUnderstanding what is happening to global insect populations has been challenging because of the lack of data \u2013 but 97% of all animals are invertebrates. Of that group, about 90% are classified as insects. They provide vital ecosystem services: pollinating crops, recycling nutrients into soils, and decomposing waste. \u201cWithout insects, our planet will not be able to survive,\u201d Hochkirch said.The team looked at all European species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s red list of threatened species. This is considered the most comprehensive source of information on species at risk. They found a fifth of European species were at risk of extinction, with 24% of invertebrates at risk, as well as 27% of all plants and 18% of vertebrates.The garden tiger moth, once-common in Britain, whose numbers fell by 89% between 1968 and 2002. Photograph: H Lansdown/AlamyThese numbers were then extrapolated to make a global estimate of total species at risk of extinction. Apart from insects, estimates remained more or less the same as those made by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (Ipbes) in 2019.\u201cThis comprehensive analysis of 14,669 continental red list assessments for European animal and plant species suggests that 2 million plant and animal species are threatened with extinction,\u201d researchers said.UN representatives declined to comment on the study itself.

However, our analysis is the most comprehensive and unequivocal to date reaffirming the magnitude of the impact of this threat at a continental scale.\u201dHochkirch said: \u201cThis study shows we have a very high proportion of species which are threatened with extinction, but we can do something about it.\u201d He highlighted the effectiveness of conservation efforts, particularly the increase in large predators across Europe, such as wolves, lynx, bears and white-tailed eagles.

        "text": "The US navy is covering up dangerous levels of radioactive waste on a 40-acre former shipyard parcel in San Francisco\u2019s waterside Hunters Point neighborhood, public health advocates charge.The land is slated to be turned over to the city as early as next year, and could be used for residential redevelopment. The accusations stem from 2021 navy testing that found 23 samples from the property showed high levels of strontium-90, a radioactive isotope that replaces calcium in bones and causes cancer.The Environmental Protection Agency raised alarm over the levels, but the navy in 2022 said its testing was inaccurate and produced a new set of data that showed levels of strontium-90 lower than zero, which was dismissed by environmental health experts as impossible.The EPA initially said the new testing \u201creads as if the navy is suppressing data results it doesn\u2019t like\u201d, but the agency has since been silent on the issue, and the Navy\u2019s Office of Inspector General has refused to investigate, said Jeff Ruch, an attorney with the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer) nonprofit, which has called on the inspector general to investigate.\u201cIt\u2019s like the navy doesn\u2019t care what they say, and we thought it was egregious enough that the IG should look at it,\u201d Ruch said. \u201cWithout any external examination, senior navy officials can lie to local officials and the public with impunity, knowing that there will be no negative career consequences.\u201dThe navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and in a letter to Peer, the inspector general wrote it would not open an investigation \u201cdue to the open ligation\u201d.The 866-acre shipyard once held a secret navy research lab where animals were injected with strontium-90, and some officials suspect the waste was flushed down the drain. The isotope was also used to create glow-in-the-dark paint on the site, and it may have washed off ships used in testing nuclear bombs in the Pacific.The US government in 1989 made the shipyard a \u201csuperfund\u201d site \u2013 a designation for the nation\u2019s most contaminated lands. Proposition P, passed by more than 86% of San Francisco voters in 2000, requires the shipyard \u201cbe cleaned to a level which would enable the unrestricted use of the property \u2013 the highest standard for cleanup established by the [EPA]\u201d.However, the navy already turned over one parcel on the site, and residents living there say unremediated contamination is behind a cluster of cancer and other health problems.Complicating the cleanup is rising sea and ground level waters, which threaten to pull the radioactive contamination into the adjacent bay.The navy and US Department of Justice is now engaged in 12 lawsuits related to the site, and the DoJ, which is representing the navy, typically does not want inspector generals to do investigations because they could turn up information that complicates the government\u2019s cases, Ruch said.\u201cThat means you have dysfunctional transactions taking place without any sort of review,\u201d he added.Though the EPA initially raised alarm over the strontium-90 test results, it has been silent on the issue in recent months, and has not responded to a Peer Freedom of Information Act Request for emails related to the testing. In response, Peer has sued, asking a judge to order the emails to be turned over.A 2022 memo sent to Peer from the EPA said the agency would rely on caps, or covering up the contaminated land with clean soil, and restrict property use, though that plan violates the provisions of Proposition P, Ruch said.San Francisco mayor London Breed late last year praised the EPA and navy\u2019s cleanup effort, calling it \u201cextensive and thorough\u201d despite the outstanding questions and fears over rising sea levels. That drew condemnation from public health advocates and the San Francisco board of supervisors, which opened an investigation into the issues.For now, it remains unclear which set of test results will guide the next steps.\u201cGiven that this land is in queue to be turned over to the city, getting to the bottom of this would be helpful, but that would involve institutional candor which appears to be in short supply,\u201d Ruch said.",

But both the City of Ballarat and the earth resources regulator said the proposed facility did not meet the threshold to require an environmental effects statement (EES). It has instead been assessed against the requirements of the Mineral Resources Act.The earth resources regulator\u2019s executive director, Anthony Hurst, said dust from the site was continuously monitored by the mine operator and his organisation received regular reports.Balmaine Gold\u2019s mine went into administration in March 2023, shortly after it temporarily ceased production because the existing tailings dam was at capacity.Ballarat resident and secretary of the action group Dr Dora Pearce said the new tailings dam may be needed to shore up the mine, but that didn\u2019t lessen the need for an EES.Pearce, who is a former environmental epidemiologist, has called for more stringent air monitoring around the mine, including more stringent monitoring of PM10 and PM2.5 particles and a chemical analysis to test for arsenic and respirable crystalline silica.She said she had been drawing lessons from central west New South Wales, where the Environmental Protection Authority this week announced it was taking the Cadia Hill goldmine to the land and environment court over alleged air pollution breaches.Residents in Cadia Valley began complaining of a perceived increase in dust pollution since the wall of the tailings dam collapsed in 2018. They have also reported elevated levels of heavy metals in their rainwater, with lead found in some tanks appearing to match lead in ore from the mine.Cadia goldmine: EPA begins court proceedings over alleged breach of clean air regulationsRead morePearce said it was vital Victoria\u2019s EPA took mine monitoring just as seriously.\u201cThe fact that the NSW EPA has acknowledged Cadia\u2019s monitoring inadequacy makes me question whether the Victorian EPA has also satisfied its monitoring around the [Ballarat] goldmine especially because it\u2019s in an urban area,\u201d she said.\u201cThis dam will be much closer to a residential area and there is no buffer.

Now comes the hard partRead moreIn December the Albanese government legislated a temporary price cap of $12 a gigajoule for gas and $125 a tonne for coal, as part of a package including $1.5bn in electricity price relief to save households about $230 on their power bills.To encourage continued supply, where coal power producers have actual costs exceeding the $125 price cap \u2013 such as pre-existing supply contracts for more expensive coal \u2013 the federal and state governments agreed to provide them a rebate.On Wednesday the Australian reported, and Guardian Australia has confirmed, that according to NSW government sources the figure for that state\u2019s coal power producers will be about $500m.\nSign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads\nRecipients would include Australia\u2019s biggest generator, the Origin-owned Eraring power station to Newcastle\u2019s south, along with coal stations at Bayswater, Liddell, Mount Piper and Vales Point B.A spokesperson for the federal energy minister, Chris Bowen, said \u201cdetails of the financial assistance are currently being finalised with the NSW government\u201d.The spokesperson said rebates were only offered where pre-existing contracts for coal are above $125 a tonne or in the \u201cvery rare circumstances in which reasonable cost of production exceeds $125 a tonne\u201d.\u201cThese actions are necessary to shield Australian households and businesses from the worst of the energy price spikes and ensure power prices are as low as possible.\u201dLast month a Queensland government source told Guardian Australia the $450m payout figure for Rio Tinto and its Gladstone power station partners would be \u201cin the ballpark\u201d, although state generators returning in May should limit compensation to six months.The $450m price tag prompted a backlash from the Greens, with their leader, Adam Bandt, saying \u201cnot a single dollar of public money\u201d should go to coal and gas corporations, and from the independent senator David Pocock, who said it \u201craises serious concerns about the total amount of compensation to be paid\u201d.\u201cThe briefings and information I received suggested that any compensation under this plan to bring much-needed energy price relief for households and small businesses would be minimal and confined to a small number of generators,\u201d Pocock said.Asked about the reported Gladstone payout, Albanese said: \u201cNo, those reports are just that, they are reports \u2026 We expect that [for Gladstone] it will be nothing like the sort of figures that I\u2019ve seen in the newspaper.\u201dBut Palaszczuk appeared to confirm the figure was possible as a maximum, responding \u201cyes, we did know\u201d compensation for Gladstone could be \u201cup to $450m\u201d.\u201cAll of that was worked out when we reached the agreement we reached,\u201d she told reporters.Federal government sources last month said they still expected the total price of compensation to be between $500m and $1bn, figures Guardian Australia reported in mid-December based on a Treasury briefing that included estimates of $250m for NSW producers.The rate of compensation is being determined by a reconciliation of electricity producers\u2019 actual costs with the $125 cap, made more difficult by the fact costs can vary with a combination of coal at a pre-contracted price or from the spot market.",

        "text": "It was just over a decade ago that Emma Smart and her husband, Andy, first decided they would not have children. Back then, her friends and family did not understand.\u201cWhen you tell people you didn\u2019t want to have children, that was a big social no-no,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd then when they asked you why, and you said for environmental reasons, that was completely unheard of.\u201cLike, I remember, my brother-in-law laughed when I said that.\u201dBut what had seemed an eccentric decision a decade ago is, with growing awareness of the parlous state of our biosphere, becoming an increasingly common sentiment. New research has found many people are now basing their decisions not to have children on their fears of climate breakdown.Children at \u2018existential risk\u2019 from climate crisis, UK\u2019s top paediatrician saysRead moreThe study, by a team of academics at University College London, is believed to be the first systematic review to explore how and why climate-related concerns may be affecting reproductive decision-making.Their analysis found that, in 12 of 13 studies, stronger concerns about climate breakdown were associated with a desire for fewer children, or none at all.Smart says the reasons for her decision were twofold. \u201cIt was, one, that moral responsibility of do you bring a child into a world where potentially they might not have a pleasant, even livable future,\u201d she told the Guardian.\u201cBut then there is the secondary moral dilemma of the kinds of emissions behind having a child. And that sounds cold and sort of more [like] data than emotion, but that was a big factor for us.\u201dUncertainty about the future and concerns about the ecological impact of the growing human population were key factors also identified by research, according to Hope Dillarstone, lead author on the study published in the journal PLOS Climate. Dillarstone and her colleagues found that concerns such as those outlined by Smart were by no means unusual.But concerns also differed in different parts of the world, Dillarstone said. \u201cThere was a concern that came out only in Zambia and Ethiopia, which was about a family\u2019s ability to subsist and acquire resources,\u201d she said.\u201cSo people were concerned, if they had too many children, that then that would diminish the chances of children being able to survive, ultimately, because they would have too many mouths to feed.\u201dDillarstone\u2019s research also found political reasons people were choosing not to have children \u2013 another finding that resonated with Smart\u2019s feelings. Over the past decade, Smart has shifted from working in wildlife conservation to full-time environmental activism, a calling which requires sacrifices incompatible with the responsibilities of having children to look after.\u201cWe love being an aunt and uncle, and also being in a position to be able to actively fight and take risks and make sacrifices,\u201d Smart said. \u201cWhether that be [getting] arrested or going to prison, or sacrifices of our time, to ensure that our nieces do have a better future.\u201dDillarstone said she hoped a greater understanding of how people make reproductive choices in the knowledge of the climate crisis would help shape public policy. But she said her findings also showed reasons that people gave were complex, and could not be generalised across the whole world.",

        "text": "It is sad to read that right to roam only applies to 8% of land in England (92 constituencies in England allow no right to roam, data shows, 13 May). No wonder Westminster politicians will be debating this huge barrier to the enjoyment of nature on 18 May. Why is such access so limited in England when the opposite is true in Scotland? Here, public access rights apply to most land and water, even around our own densely populated cities, so long as we follow the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.Today\u2019s Westminster politicians need to come north and learn about access to nature. The annual prime ministerial visit to Balmoral provides the perfect opportunity. King Charles can demonstrate how rights of public access apply to most land and water on the Balmoral estate and in the surrounding hills, woods and fields, whether on foot, bike or horseback. If the king and any member of the public can exercise right to roam in this way, then the prime minister should return south with a determination to deliver equal rights of access to nature for all citizens. England deserves no less.Dave MorrisKinnesswood, Kinross The distribution of Labour and Tory MPs follows lines of Labour success in urban areas and Conservative in rural. It should be no surprise, therefore, that it is Conservative constituencies that have any land to roam on at all.While the report does not detail what green space is counted in cities, where I live in Manchester the council has a policy for how much green space there should be by population, a useful measure in planning, vindicated by the pandemic. A more egalitarian way of quantifying right to roam would be what percentage of green space is available to roam in each constituency, otherwise it would appear that having a large piece of the pie only means you have to share less of it.Laura CollierManchester Were I a ground-nesting warbler, I would look askance at Guy Shrubsole\u2019s campaign for a right of access to the majority of land. Right to roam in England means, to most, right to roam with my dog, and these panting predators disturb and disrupt vast swathes of potential nesting sites. This has been exacerbated by the recent sharp rise in dog ownership, and the seeming unwritten right to own a dog, whatever the circumstances.

A more powerful influence is the company\u2019s own shareholders, who have clearly demanded a rethink on previous pledges to slash hydrocarbon output by 40% this decade.Three years ago, when he was fresh in the job, Looney sounded as if he\u2019d made up his mind. \u201cToday is about a vision, a direction of travel,\u201d he declared to an audience of investors and industry analysts. \u201cThe direction is set. We are heading to net zero. There is no turning back.\u201dAnd now? Well, there is still no reversal, BP would argue, because an extra $1bn (\u00a3830m) a year until 2030 is going into what the company calls its \u201ctransition growth engines\u201d \u2013 meaning biofuels, electric charging points, wind, solar and hydrogen. That is what Looney meant when he spoke on Tuesday of \u201cleaning in\u201d to the same strategy.But an equivalent extra sum will also be directed at oil and gas, meaning the ambition of reducing hydrocarbon output by 40% by 2030 has been scrapped in favour of a 25% figure. Whereas BP used to say it would happily live without the \u201clow margin barrels\u201d that would be removed from the production schedule, it now refers to \u201cshort-cycle fast-payback opportunities\u201d. This may not count as U-turn, but it is a major detour.The world is \u201ca different place\u201d and \u201cneeds energy that is secure and affordable as well as lower carbon\u201d, argued Looney, emphasising the need for an \u201corderly\u201d transition. Well, yes, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine had obviously transformed the economic calculation. Oil is now $80-plus a barrel v $40 when the transition-speak was turned up. That explains the investor pressure to be oily for longer: BP\u2019s shares, even as they rose 7% after the latest results, are still rated substantially lower than those of unashamedly oil-focused ExxonMobil.But one wonders where this plot is going next, and whether even the diluted hydrocarbon pledges are vulnerable to another rethink. BP is banking on returns on capital of 15% from its fresh oil and gas investments but referenced just 6%-8% in parts on its renewables power portfolio. Therein lies in the difficulty in trying to please all shades of investors. Even the crowd that loudly proclaims its environmental credentials seems to want two things at once: the halo of renewables plus more of the rewards on display on Tuesday \u2013 record profits of $28bn in 2022 and share buybacks galore \u2013 from dirty oil and gas.Looney predicted his new, rejigged investment plan would deliver top-line earnings of $51-$56bn by 2030. His life will be trouble-free if that ambition looks like it will be met over the next few years. Problems will arise, however, if the financial goals start to appear out of reach. In that case, it\u2019s not hard to imagine that pressure will come to abandon the \u201cleaning in\u201d line and be wobbly on renewables.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Classic British apples may die out and be swapped for varieties from New Zealand and Japan, as climate breakdown means traditional fruits are no longer viable.Apples such as pippin or the the ancient nonpareil, grown in Britain since the 1500s, are struggling in the changed climate because there are not enough \u201cchilling hours\u201d for the trees to lie dormant in winter and conserve energy for growing fruit.Scientists at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, are planting 40 apple trees, a third of which are heritage varieties that once grew in its Georgian kitchen gardens. Another third are new varieties bred to need less cold over winter, and the final third are from warmer countries including South Africa. The varieties will be compared to see which has the best crop in London\u2019s warming temperatures.In January, the Met Office announced that 2022 had been the sixth warmest year on record, and it looks as if 2023 will be another record-breaker. But though many crops are affected by the summer\u2019s intense heat and drought, apple trees are struggling because they need a period of cold over the winter.In autumn, they store enough energy to see them through the dormant period, and then burst into action again in spring. Perfect chilling hours for apples are those below 6C but above freezing, and most traditional apple trees need about 1,000 chilling hours. If temperatures remain above 6C then they have to respire, using up energy stores throughout the winter period, which in turn limits the stores available in spring, meaning fewer apples grow.Gala apples are a popular variety grown in New Zealand, but the horticulturalist Helena Dove, who runs Kew\u2019s kitchen garden, said the breed may overtake traditional varieties in Britain.\u201cThe Gala was bred in New Zealand, which means it only needs about 600 chilling hours, which is more like what we\u2019re getting at the minute in the UK,\u201d she explained.\u201cWe will see if gala has a better crop than nonpareil, which was bred in 1696. We are also trying the Fuji apple, which originated in Japan and only needs 400 chill hours, which might do better in these milder winters.\u201dWhen some of the most beloved heritage varieties of British apple were bred, she said: \u201cWe had these lovely cold winters, which we aren\u2019t getting any more.\u201dDove hopes to have a crop in three years, and to be able to share some preliminary findings with the industry then. Farmers are ripping out orchards because of climate breakdown and a lack of workers, and she hopes this research could bolster the industry.\u201cThis chilling hours conversation is happening,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s not just apples, pears and blackcurrants that have this feature where they need to stay dormant.\u201dHowever, it is not certain that these new varieties will be the solution: \u201cWe could find out that we don\u2019t get a dry enough winter for these varieties. So this is why it\u2019s an experiment, because South Africa doesn\u2019t have the wet weather that we have. So it\u2019s going to be whether they\u2019ve got low chill hours and can cope with the amount of rain.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "There is no prospect of a magic bullet rescuing the world from the impact of global warming, scientists warned this weekend. As Earth completed the hottest month ever recorded on its surface, climate experts and engineers made it clear that only global reductions in fossil fuel burning could prevent the planet from entering an era of intense overheating.There have been proposals that still-to-be-developed global technologies could avert impending climate catastrophe and prevent temperatures from soaring. Examples include projects that could capture carbon emissions and store them underground or schemes that could deflect sunlight away from Earth.However, senior researchers say the only realistic hope for avoiding the worst impacts of climate change would be to halt the burning of coal, gas and oil. \u201cThe number one priority that we have is to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources,\u201d said Dr Greg Mutch of Newcastle University.\u201cThat is going to be critical. After you have done that, then you think about capturing any carbon emissions from industrial plants that cannot operate without producing CO2.\u201dExamples of industrial processes that produce carbon dioxide include cement and fertiliser manufacture. These generate carbon dioxide not just by burning fossil fuels for heat but as chemical byproducts from the processes involved in making these products. Industries like these generate about 5% of all carbon dioxide emissions, so it will be worthwhile tackling them, say scientists.However, capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it underground \u2013 as a way to tackle the global problem of climate change \u2013 will be far trickier. Although massive amounts of carbon dioxide are emitted every year, it remains a very dilute component of the atmosphere. Around 400 parts per million of air around us is now made up of carbon dioxide. That is 0.04% of the atmosphere.\u201cThat is very, very dilute and it will take an awful lot of energy to extract that carbon dioxide. From an engineering point of view, it\u2019s much easier to separate a gas from a concentrated mixture than it is to extract a gas that is only 0.04% of the mixture,\u201d said Mutch.Nevertheless, some companies have begun development work on plants that would suck in air, extract its carbon dioxide and store it. The technology remains in its infancy and has not been helped by indecision over its use. The UK was one of the first countries to fund research into direct air capture and other greenhouse gas removal technologies by providing \u00a3100m in 2020 but since then has been overtaken by US funding of some $3.5bn on direct air capture alone.\u201cThe problem is that climate change itself is already one huge experiment on our planet,\u201d said Prof David Reiner of Cambridge University. \u201cNow we are trying to combat that experiment with other experiments. That will have unknown consequences.\u201cOn the other hand, I take solace from the fact that many more scientific minds are now turning to these problems, that more research is being started, and that a lot more public and private funding is going into ways of tackling global warming so there is room, in the long run, for some optimism.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Among the proposed SRM projects are schemes that would scatter the upper atmosphere with tiny reflective particles, such as sulphate aerosols, which could then reflect sunlight back into space. Alternatively, this could be done by placing huge mirrors into orbit around Earth.The problem is that such schemes would still allow carbon dioxide to build up in the planet\u2019s atmosphere. The world might cool a little as sunlight was diminished, but how this would affect weather patterns is not clear. Carbon dioxide would still have to be removed some time in the future. More and more carbon dioxide would dissolve in the sea and ocean acidification would continue to intensify, triggering even more damage to coral reefs and other marine ecosystems.Dismissing SRM technology, Prof Joeri Rogelj of Imperial College, London, called it \u201cirresponsible, dangerous and a threat to the manageability\u201d of our survival, saying: \u201cIt is not a solution but an extremely dangerous band-aid that covers up the global warming problem without healing it, creating a false and unwarranted sense of climate safety while the core of the problem continues to fester.\u201d",

Building gigafactories is seen as a key aim by the UK government, which pledged \u00a3100m in financial support to the project.Rishi Sunak restarts talks on London listing for UK tech firm ArmRead moreBritishvolt\u2019s site, near Blyth in Northumberland, is seen by many in the automotive industry as one of the UK\u2019s best potential locations for a gigafactory because of proximity to power lines carrying renewable energy and a deep-sea port. However, the startup reached the brink of collapse in October as it ran out of money, with building work on the factory mostly halted since the summer.Under the terms of the rescue deal, the investors will pay \u00a330m for 95% of the business \u2013 a deal that would leave existing shareholders including co-founder Orral Nadjari and FTSE 100 companies Glencore and Ashtead with 5% of the business worth less than \u00a32m.

Britishvolt on Monday announced it was in talks with unnamed investors to end weeks of uncertainty over its future.Britishvolt did not name other investors who are backing the consortium.

        "text": "Poor countries will be able to pause their debt repayments if hit by climate disaster, under plans announced by the World Bank at the finance summit in Paris.The international development organisation said it would insert new clauses in any agreements with developing countries, allowing them to suspend debt payments in the case of extreme weather events, starting with some of the poorest and most vulnerable nations.The UK also said it would apply similar arrangements to its loans to 12 countries in Africa and the Caribbean.Debt relief for governments struggling with the impacts of the climate crisis has been a key demand of poor countries. However, the World Bank will only apply the clauses to new loans, and the announcements do not add up to the debt forgiveness that some countries would like to see.Carly Munnelly, a senior adviser at Save the Children, said: \u201cWhile such clauses are helpful, they are insufficient for addressing the crippling debt burdens faced by many countries today, which are undermining governments\u2019 capacity to invest in children\u2019s health, education and other rights.\u201dMia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, told the summit that the world needed not just reform but \u201cabsolute transformation\u201d of the global financial system, to help developing countries emerge from poverty in a low-carbon way, and to cope with the impacts of the climate crisis.\u201cThat transformation is required because, while the world knew since the 1890s that we were facing warming of the climate, we chose not to heed the advice of scientists,\u201d she said.At the summit, hosted by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, countries and institutions unveiled a raft of measures to help raise finance, and assist poor countries.Several major economies, including France and Japan, will redirect tens of billions of dollars to the developing world, in the form of money known as \u201cspecial drawing rights\u201d under the International Monetary Fund.The EU called for an expansion of carbon trading, which it believes can raise a large proportion of the revenues needed for climate finance, in both developed and developing countries.The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, sought to reassure developing countries that focusing on the climate was not at the expense of lifting people out of poverty.Senegal signed up to a \u201cjust energy transition partnership\u201d deal, which would lead to a large expansion of renewables in the country. However, the agreement did not cover its large gas reserves.The measures announced at the Paris conference, which ends on Friday afternoon, do not add up to anywhere near the trillions of dollars that experts say are needed to shift the global economy to a low-carbon footing and assist poor nations stricken by climate disaster.That is not a problem, according to Saleemul Huq, the director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, in Bangladesh: \u201cIt went very well to talk about the scale of change needed and the scale of finance needed to tackle climate change and poverty alleviation at the same time,\u201d he said.\u201cI don\u2019t much care for announcements of pledges from such summits. I would prefer to see each leader here to actually deliver what they have promised.\u201dNicholas Stern, the UK peer and economist, said the conference would be a success if it set a new direction for countries in thinking about climate finance. \u201cWhat we should hope for is a shared understanding of what we need to do,\u201d he told the Guardian.One heated topic of discussion was over taxes. Many poor countries want new taxes, including potentially a new levy on shipping, on frequent flyers, and on the bumper profits of fossil fuel companies, or on fossil fuel production. Some experts also argue for a wealth tax, to pay for the rescue and rehabilitation of poor countries suffering the impacts of the climate crisis, known as loss and damage.",

        "text": "Low-traffic neighbourhoods significantly reduce the number of motor vehicles within their boundaries without appearing to push traffic on to roads around their edges, the most comprehensive study yet of such schemes in the UK has concluded.The research, which was based on traffic count data before and after the installation of 46 so-called LTNs in London, found a reduction in motor traffic within the zones of 32.7% when measured as the median, and a 46.9% drop when calculated as the mean.Of the 413 roads inside the LTNs with before-and-after traffic counts, the percentage experiencing an average of fewer than 1,000 motor vehicles a day, seen as a good shorthand for a street receptive to more cycling and walking, rose from 41% to 66%.This could mean \u201ca qualitative change in the local environment\u201d on at least some streets because of the LTNs, the researchers said.LTNs use either physical filters, such as bollards and planters, or traffic cameras to prevent motor vehicles using some smaller residential streets as through-routes, while bicycle and foot traffic is unaffected.Opponents of the schemes, which have proved controversial in some places, with a handful removed, claim they do not reduce the overall amount of motor traffic but simply move it to other roads.Graphic for LTN traffic dataWhile the authors behind the research, from the University of Westminster\u2019s Active Travel Academy (ATA), noted they only had useable data for just under half the 96 LTNs installed in London between March 2020 and May 2021, they said there was significant overall evidence of so-called traffic evaporation.Data from the 174 count points on boundary roads showed what the authors said was a more mixed picture, but without apparent evidence that such roads were necessarily seeing more traffic once an LTN was installed.Of those monitored, 47% showed a fall in motor traffic and 53% showed an increase. When measured as a median, the overall figure for boundary roads rose by 1.3%, but fell by 1.6% when calculated as a mean (average).When the totals were adjusted using Transport for London data for wider traffic changes, to account for factors like the Covid-19 pandemic and differing seasons, boundary roads had an overall mean increase of 0.7% in motor traffic, or 82 vehicles a day on average.Within this, the researchers found what they called \u201csubstantial variation in both directions\u201d on boundary roads. They concluded this was mainly due to non-LTN factors such as other works, and said more research could be done on reducing traffic on boundary routes.The study noted other caveats, including that the majority of counts took place within inner London rather than more distant suburbs, and that the extent and quality of traffic data, provided by councils, was varied, with some not having produced any monitoring at all.The researchers also pointed to the need for further study on other effects of LTNs, including how to best mitigate their impact on people who particularly need to drive on local journeys, for example some people with disabilities.The research used data from TfL, was funded by the climate charity Possible, and carried out by the ATA.Asa Thomas, a PhD researcher at the academy and the lead author of the study, said the findings pointed to a significant drop in motor traffic within LTNs, along with \u201clittle indication of systematic displacement of this traffic to boundary roads\u201d.Prof Rachel Aldred, the director of the ATA and co-author of the study, said: \u201cThe research indicates there has been overall \u2018traffic evaporation\u2019 as a result of these schemes, as the mean average reduction in motor traffic on internal roads is around 10 times higher than the mean average increase on boundary roads, adjusting for background trends.\u201cThis suggests that not only do LTNs have substantial benefits inside their boundaries, but they can also contribute to wider traffic reduction goals.\u201d This article was amended on 20 January 2023 to give the median motor-traffic increase on boundary roads as 1.3% rather than 2.1%.",

The cans will come in 187ml, 200ml and 250ml sizes.The move to \u201cvin in a tin\u201d is expected to save more than 300 tonnes of glass packaging and will halve the carbon footprint per drink because the recyclable cans require less energy to transport as they are lighter and take up less space than bottles.The move comes after the popularisation of \u201cgin in a tin\u201d and other canned cocktails, particularly during the pandemic lockdowns, which prompted outdoor drinking and picnics.Drinks makers have been seeking alternative packaging because the price of glass has almost tripled since the start of the pandemic amid increased demand for other material besides plastic packaging.The price of aluminium has also risen but by about a third, according to data from letsrecycle.com. Waitrose said it would not necessarily make cost savings from the policy shift as it cost more to fill a can.Barry Dick, the beer, wine and spirit bulk sourcing manager at Waitrose, which last year bought in 3m small wine bottles, said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to pioneer this move and make reducing waste even easier for our customers. We know that more people are buying their drinks in canned formats, from cocktails on the go to craft beer, which is why making this shift in our wine category makes so much sense.\u201cPicking up a can of wine is a great way to enjoy wine in moderation, especially if you\u2019re heading to a picnic or social occasion. It also enables customers to try a new variety without worrying about wastage or cost. We hope the move will encourage suppliers to continue to develop a diverse and exciting range of wines in cans.\u201dThe new cans will include a wide range of grape choices including whites, reds and ros\u00e9s from Sauvignon Blanc, Malbec, Pinot Grigio, and Chardonnay.In the UK about three-quarters of aluminium cans and glass bottles are recycled, mostly through local authority kerbside collections, according to the government.While cans and bottles can be infinitely recyclable (with glass sorting plants now able to ensure the material can be used to make new bottles, according to the Waste and Resources Action Programme) in the past a large proportion of glass waste was used for building aggregate.Scotland and Wales plan to include glass bottles in deposit return schemes expected to launch this summer and next year respectively, but the UK government said this would not be so for the English and Northern Ireland versions, which will focus on plastic bottles.",

Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesLast week, Sunak said the 2030 deadline on the sale of petrol and diesel vehicles would be pushed back to 2035, and the boiler phase-out by 2035 would be weakened. These moves are likely to raise the UK\u2019s emissions in the next decade, but Sunak did not set out whether or how that would be offset by cuts elsewhere.The government\u2019s previous plans to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and on phasing out gas boilers, were key parts of the UK\u2019s submissions under the Paris climate agreement. Plans known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are fundamental to the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change.At the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021, Sharma fought to secure global agreement that NDCs should be updated frequently and should represent a strengthening of targets, to prevent any weakening or backsliding. At the Cop27 summit in Egypt, he spoke out sharply to rebuke countries that wanted to renege on previous commitments.Sam Hunter Jones, lawyer at ClientEarth, a campaigning group, said: \u201cRolling back on existing policies risks going against a Paris agreement cornerstone of increased ambition, just months before Cop28 negotiations. The UK will now need to go even further in other areas, when it submits its next round of international climate commitments, to ensure the overall package is stronger rather than weaker.\u201dOne developing country negotiator told the Observer the move would anger many countries, after the UK took a stand at Cop26 and Cop27 on preventing backsliding, and make it easier for other countries to ignore their commitments. \u201cBacksliding begets backsliding,\u201d they said.But former Whitehall insiders said Downing Street was no longer much interested in how the UK\u2019s reputation was damaged in the eyes of other countries. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in Number Ten really cares,\u201d one said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Social media showed long lines for bottled water at Philadelphia area stores.Early on Sunday Mike Carroll, deputy managing director for Philadelphia\u2019s office of transportation, infrastructure and sustainability, said there had been no sign of contaminants in city water but added officials \u201ccannot be 100% certain\u201d traces won\u2019t show up by Sunday afternoon. He called health risks from the material \u201cvery low if present at all\u201d but said officials wanted people to be aware so they could consider using bottled water to drink or cook with to further minimize any risk.The city water department said in an update on Sunday evening that water \u201cwill remain safe to drink and use\u201d at least through Monday, based on the time it takes water to move through treatment and water mains before reaching customers.It added that the earlier message that residents may want to use bottled water was made out of an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d.The earlier advisory that customers receiving water from the Baxter Drinking Water Treatment Plant may choose to drink bottled water on March 26 was issued out of an abundance of caution. Testing has not shown the presence of water impacted by the spill in the Baxter system.\u2014 Philadelphia Water (@PhillyH2O) March 26, 2023Officials said intakes to the city\u2019s Baxter drinking water treatment plant were closed after the spill but they were opened overnight to maintain minimal water levels to avoid damage to equipment and to supply water for fire safety and other essential needs.State environmental officials are leading the response.Pennsylvania American Water said its Yardley water treatment plant about 15 miles (24km) upstream of the release remains unaffected. Aqua Pennsylvania said it shut off the intake to its Bristol water system to protect customers and had seen no impact from the spill.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Two weeks ago, my employer presented me with a stark ultimatum: return to my offices in Kiel, Germany, within five days, or lose my job. I am a climate researcher and since March 2023, I have been completing vital fieldwork into the social impact of climate change almost 15,000 miles away by overland routes, on the island of Bougainville off the coast of Papua New Guinea.My fieldwork had been mired in unforeseeable problems, from natural disasters to security threats, and my employer was, unsurprisingly, unhappy that my return had been delayed by many weeks. The urgency of their request to return meant I would have to jump on a plane if I was to meet the deadline; but for me, this was not an option. I have been practising conscientious objection to flying for more than 10 years. My employer has supported me on a \u201cslow trip\u201d in the past. I do not boycott flying altogether, but I will only catch a plane when no other alternative exists.This weekend, I will set sail on a cargo ship to return to Germany, travelling to East New Britain in Papua New Guinea. From there, I will cover the remaining distance to Europe by cargo ship, ferry, train and coach.Many people have asked why it is so important for me to travel as low-carbon as possible. I have three reasons. First, I want to be consistent with my moral commitment to avoid flying. Aviation is the biggest contributor to climate change of all forms of transport, a major factor in the rise in temperatures and the extreme weather events that we are witnessing more and more frequently all around the world.A trip by plane from Papua New Guinea to Germany produces, in 32 hours, 5.3 tonnes of CO2 per passenger. Slow travel produces approximately 12 times less (420kg). In the current state of climate emergency, wasting 4.9 tonnes of CO2 \u2013 about how much the average person in the world emits in one year \u2013 to expedite my return to Europe is not morally acceptable to me.\u2018A trip by plane from Papua New Guinea to Germany produces, in 32 hours, 5.3 tonnes of CO2.\u2019 Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PASecond, I promised all the 1,800 participants in my research in Bougainville that I would return low-carbon. I want to keep my promise. White men (of whom I am one, as I am frequently reminded here) are often referred to as giaman \u2013 liars, fraudsters in Tok Pisin \u2013 probably with good reason given the country\u2019s turbulent colonial past. I do not want to be seen as giaman.Finally, and most importantly, I hope my case might put a little crack into the wall of \u201cselfishness, greed, and apathy\u201d, which, in the words of climate lawyer Gus Speth, is the main hindrance to stopping runaway climate change. Many people will think that it is madness to give up their dream job to avoid taking one flight. But in the current era of climate breakdown, it is, in my opinion, insane to continue with \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, when science tells us that we are either dangerously close to or past the point of collapse for major ecosystems.I am not the type of person who likes telling others what to do. But I would like to invite people to shift the boundaries of what is considered normal within their own sphere of action. Putting responsibility on the average individual may be seen as a way to let those who are really responsible off the hook. According to Oxfam, the richest 10% in the world produce over half of emissions. Ninety companies are responsible for 63% of the world\u2019s historic CO2 emissions. Worldwide, flying remains the prerogative of the elite \u2013 researchers from western countries included, who are likely part of the 10% producing the bulk of emissions.But eEmpirical research shows that \u201cwalking the walk\u201d is important. Scientists who have reduced their carbon footprint are more likely to be persuasive with the public than scientists who have not, according to one study. Individual action, even if obviously ineffective in dramatically reducing carbon emissions, has been shown to have significant amplifying effects, as the individual\u2019s \u201cgood example\u201d is replicated and further propagated by people on their social networks.At the time of writing, I am waiting to embark on the cargo ship on the first leg of my low-carbon journey to Europe. When I arrive in Europe in about 45 days, I will be jobless. If, on my way, I manage to persuade people that our planet is seriously endangered and that radical, extraordinary action is needed, losing my job will have been a price worth paying.\nGianluca Grimalda, formerly senior researcher at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, is a social scientist interested in social cohesion and adaptation to climate change\n",

        "text": "Prospective investors in the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk will undergo \u201cstrict national security checks\u201d, the government has said, as it formally kicked off a hunt for outside investment.The project, led by the French state-backed energy company EDF and backed by the UK government, aims to produce 3.2 gigawatts of electricity \u2013 enough to power about 6m homes \u2013 and was approved in July last year.On Monday, the newly appointed energy security secretary, Claire Coutinho, opened applications for interested parties to register their interest in investing in it.In reality, the project has been touted to potential investors \u2013 including sovereign wealth funds, infrastructure and pension funds \u2013 for years. In June 2022, advisers at Barclays were appointed to lead the search for investors in the huge project.The government and EDF have each taken a 20% stake in the project. Ministers hope the Suffolk plant will mark the next phase of a planned nuclear renaissance in the UK and have so far pumped in \u00a3700m.They have also made \u00a3511m available to continue project development and prepare the site for construction, ahead of the planned equity raise for the project. Estimates on its overall cost and build time, expected to be at least \u00a320bn, have varied significantly.Funding for the scheme faced upheaval after the government forced out the Chinese state-backed nuclear company CGN, which initially had a 20% stake, amid security concerns over Beijing\u2019s further involvement in UK nuclear.CGN has part-funded the Hinkley Point C in Somerset, a sister project to Sizewell C based on the same designs.The government said on Monday that \u201cany investment will also be subject to strict national security checks\u201d. Investors in the United Arab Emirates, Australia and Saudi Arabia have reportedly already been approached, while the idea of publicly floating a stake in the project has also been touted, although this strategy is unlikely.Nuclear industry sources said that efforts to get pension funds to invest in the project had stalled, and that the prospect of a general election next year could hold up the financing process.Chris O\u2019Shea, the chief executive of British Gas owner Centrica \u2013 a minority investor in Britain\u2019s nuclear power stations \u2013 last year told the Observer it was interested in the Sizewell C project. The investment firm Greencoat Capital has also expressed an interest, and the Emirati sovereign wealth fund Mubadala has also been tipped to invest.Sizewell C\u2019s joint managing director, Julia Pyke, said investors \u201cshould feel confident in our proposals as we are building a replica project [to Hinkley C] with government backing, a mature reactor design and a workforce ready to build it\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The delivery body aims to smooth the path to the building of a new generation of nuclear plants.Sizewell C has faced significant local opposition. On Monday, the Together Against Sizewell C campaign said it had received permission from a court of appeal judge, Lord Justice Coulson, for a further hearing on its concerns over the impact on the local water supply. The group was refused a judicial review into the consent granted to Sizewell C by the then energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng.",

        "text": "The heads of major oil companies will make a historic appearance before Congress on Thursday to answer accusations that their firms have spent years lying about the climate crisis.For the first time, the top executives from the US\u2019s largest oil company, ExxonMobil, as well as Shell, Chevron and BP will be questioned under oath about the industry\u2019s long campaign to discredit and deny the evidence that burning fossil fuels drove global heating.The dirty dozen: meet America\u2019s top climate villainsRead moreA leading critic of the petroleum industry behind the hearing by the House oversight committee, Representative Ro Khanna, said the executives\u2019 testimony has the potential to be as significant as the 1994 congressional hearing at which the heads of the big tobacco companies were confronted with the question of whether they knew nicotine was addictive.They denied it and that lie opened the door to years of litigation which resulted in a $206bn settlement against the cigarette makers.Khanna told the Guardian that the oil company chiefs face a similar moment of reckoning.\u201cThey\u2019ve got a very tricky balance. They either have to admit certain wrongdoing or they run the risk of lying under oath. If I were them, I would come in with more of a mea culpa approach and acknowledge what they\u2019ve done wrong,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019ll be a turning point for them. It could be the big tobacco moment. We\u2019ve never had a situation where the big oil executives have to answer under oath for their company\u2019s behaviour.\u201dKhanna said that he wanted Americans to take away the message from the hearing that the oil companies \u201cknew they lied\u201d about the climate emergency.The CEOs, who have opted to testify by video, are Darren Woods of Exxon, David Lawler of BP American, Michael Wirth of Chevron and the president of Shell, Gretchen Watkins.The leaders of two powerful lobby groups accused of acting as front organisations for big oil, the American Petroleum Institute and the US Chamber of Commerce, will also testify.Khanna said the oil chiefs will be confronted with evidence of a persistent and coordinated cover-up, including documents that have not been made public before.\u201cThe documents confirm the misinformation and deception that they\u2019ve engaged in in the past explicitly, and that they continue to engage in through third parties,\u201d he said. \u201cThe record is so clear that they will be risking perjuring themselves if they deny the record.\u201dBut the hearing will also be a test for whether the oil industry\u2019s critics can back up their claims of a sprawling conspiracy by the fossil fuel companies to block action on the climate emergency \u2013 an accusation also made in dozens of lawsuits by US states, municipalities and private organisations.Geoffrey Supran, a research associate at Harvard\u2019s department of history of science and co-author of a groundbreaking study of Exxon\u2019s communications on the climate crisis, said the oil executives are well-practiced at sidestepping responsibility.\u201cThis will be a challenging hearing. This is a situation where the historical record is incontrovertible but the climate denial machine has been like a sprawling, well-oiled, well-funded network for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the range of actors and tactics involved, asking the right questions at the right time, having the right documents at your fingertips to pin them into a corner is tricky.\u201dThe hearings follow the release of a growing body of evidence that the oil industry knew about and covered up the growing threat from burning fossil fuels for decades. That includes a raft of Exxon documents held at the University of Texas, and uncovered by the Columbia Journalism School and the Los Angeles Times in 2015.In 1979, a study by Exxon\u2019s own scientists concluded that burning fossil fuels \u201cwill cause dramatic environmental effects\u201d in the coming decades. It called the issue \u201cgreat and urgent\u201d.Exxon\u2019s response to that and similar warnings was to shut down research into global heating and to go on a public relations offensive to discredit climate science as no more than a theory, and to shift responsibility on to consumers.In 2019, Martin Hoffert, a professor of physics at New York University, told a congressional hearing that his climate modelling for Exxon in the 1980s showed that burning fossil fuels was \u201cincreasingly having a perceptible influence on Earth\u2019s climate\u201d.Meanwhile the company was pushing a different narrative.\u201cExxon was publicly promoting views that its own scientists knew were wrong, and we knew that because we were the major group working on this. This was immoral and has greatly set back efforts to address climate change,\u201d said Hoffert.Other oil firms face similar accusations alongside trade groups and thinktanks they funded to deny climate science.This story is published as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story",

The US Department of Agriculture uses these devices to kill predators and other wildlife.\u201cThis has been a long road,\u201d said Brooks Fahy, the executive director of the conservation group Predator Defense, who has spent decades fighting the use of cyanide bombs in the US. \u201cI consider this in the annals of conservation wildlife predator issues to be a historic event.\u201dFor decades, a little-known federal program called Wildlife Services has used cyanide bombs to kill wild animals like coyotes that can prey on livestock and cause other problems for agricultural interests. The small spring-loaded devices are primarily planted on private holdings with permission from landowners, but they are also sometimes deployed on public lands. When triggered by an unsuspecting animal, they release a cloud of sodium cyanide that can quickly kill.Wildlife Services, a program within the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, has used M-44s to kill tens of thousands of animals over the last decade. Non-target animals, including imperiled wildlife and family pets, have repeatedly died by these devices as well, and a concerted campaign to ban their use on public land has been gaining momentum in recent years.Canyon Mansfield holds the collar of his dog, Casey, who was killed by a cyanide-ejecting device placed on public land near his home in Pocatello, Idaho. Photograph: Jordon Beesley/APKey figures in this effort include the Mansfield family of Pocatello, Idaho. In March 2017, Canyon Mansfield, then 14, was walking with his yellow lab Kasey in the hills behind his family home when he spotted what he thought was a sprinkler head. He reached for the device and accidentally triggered a cyanide bomb that a Wildlife Services employee had placed on federally owned land abutting the Mansfields\u2019 property.The device sprayed both Canyon and Kasey in the face with sodium cyanide. The dog started convulsing and died, while Canyon was rushed to the emergency room. He was released home later that day. This launched the Mansfield family\u2019s years-long effort to put an end to the use of cyanide bombs.\u201cThe United States government put a cyanide bomb 350ft from my house, and killed my dog and poisoned my child,\u201d Theresa Mansfield, Canyon\u2019s mother, told the Guardian in 2020. \u201cI\u2019m after justice,\u201d she added.In October 2022, the Oregon representative Peter DeFazio and California representative Jared Huffman, among others, asked the interior secretary, Deb Haaland, to use her department\u2019s authority to prohibit M-44 devices on all federal land under interior department jurisdiction.On 22 November, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an interior department agency that administers more than 240m acres of land, announced that it was \u201ctaking action to end the use of M-44 devices that deliver sodium cyanide on public land\u201d.Though the agency says that less than 1% of the M-44s used by Wildlife Services in 2022 were planted on BLM-managed lands, advocates are still hailing the ban as a major step forward. Several of the most high-profile human-involved M-44 poisonings, including the Mansfield incident, occurred on BLM land. Advocates also believe the BLM\u2019s decision could help push additional land management agencies such as the US Forest Service, as well as other state governments, to prohibit cyanide bombs.\u201cNow, we can focus our efforts on pushing other federal agencies like the USDA to follow suit,\u201d said Representative Huffman in a statement.The agriculture department\u2019s animal and plant health inspection service did not respond to a request for comment.",

Documents show that JBS, the world\u2019s biggest meat company, and allies including the Global Dairy Platform, planned to make arguments in favour of livestock farming with \u201cfull force\u201d. While the sincerity of fossil-fuel businesses\u2019 commitment to a green transition has long been doubted, they are not the only energy-intensive businesses to approach\u00a0Cop28 as an opportunity to promote their activities \u2013\u00a0rather than a threat.While the ostensible purpose is to safeguard the planet for the future, the fear is that the Cop process has been captured by the short-term interests of carbon-emitting industries that will do anything to protect their wealth. This year\u2019s gathering is hosted by Sultan Al Jaber, the chief executive of the UAE\u2019s national oil company.In petro-states such as the UAE, the economic interests of rulers and fossil-fuel businesses are the same. But other rich nations with more mixed economies are also culpable. On Friday Rishi Sunak gave a speech that sought to justify his disgraceful watering-down of green measures on the grounds that\u00a0they would cost people \u201cthousands of pounds\u201d \u2013 with no mention of expected savings. Meanwhile, in the US, fossil fuel extraction is surging, despite the support for renewables in the Inflation Reduction Act.So far the Cop process has failed to reduce the amount of carbon being pumped into the atmosphere, although the rate of increase has slowed. The remaining carbon budget \u2013 the amount that can be emitted while holding on to a 50% chance of staying within the 1.5C limit \u2013 stands at 250bn tonnes. One key question for negotiators in Dubai is how that budget is allocated. Another is how the people and ecosystems most harmed by global heating will be helped.On the latter, there has been some progress with the establishment of a loss and damage fund. But the battle over the continued production of fossil fuels, and the future of carbon-intensive industries such as animal agriculture and aviation, is raging. The first Cop resolution on transforming food systems is a step forward.Writing in the Guardian, Mr Al Jaber and Kenya\u2019s president, William Ruto, described the need for finance to unlock green industrialisation in the global south as \u201cthe existential battle of our generation\u201d. But carbon-intensive industries and petro-states face existential questions of their own. What is their role in the fossil-free future? One answer is that it will not be fossil-free at all. The African forests recently bought as offsets by the UAE-based company Blue Carbon are a licence to keep polluting. Such deals cannot be dismissed out of hand, especially while loss and damage funds are inadequate. African countries need funding for conservation. However, the effectiveness of carbon markets has not been proven. That emissions must be reduced, not redistributed or cancelled out through accounting, is an inexorable fact.It is the struggle to be allowed to continue emitting in which most, if not all, of those who rely on carbon-intensive activity to generate wealth are engaged. Big oil was never just a handful of corporations \u2013 BP, Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron \u2013 as important as those businesses are. The confrontation goes both deeper and wider, taking in industries ranging from shipping and agriculture to construction and cars.",

        "text": "The strong reaction to the Guardian\u2019s joint investigation into carbon offsetting shows how much is at stake when the effectiveness of market mechanisms in combating global heating is challenged. Already, in Australia, politicians and scientists have renewed their criticism of public entities using international carbon credit schemes to offset local emissions. Verra, the Washington-based non-profit at the centre of the story, is the world\u2019s leading carbon standard, certifying the credits that companies use to make claims about their environmental impact. It is a blow to anyone committed to the idea that emissions trading can help the world to reach net zero, to learn that 90% of the rainforest credits analysed are unlikely to represent genuine carbon reductions.The problem, which was uncovered by journalists working alongside experts using satellite images, is the methodology used by Verra to certify its credits. While Verra disputes the findings, and is due to publish its own assessment, the researchers found that the evidence used to calculate offsets was flawed. Predictions of what would have happened in the absence of credits were unreliable, and benefits were overstated.Given Verra\u2019s importance, the significance of the findings goes beyond a single organisation. What happens next is crucial, and will be closely watched by governments and businesses around the world. The question is: can existing processes be improved? Here, academics and environmental campaigners are divided. Carbon markets have long been controversial, with some arguing that any attempt to protect nature by assigning it monetary value is doomed. According to this view, the focus on nature conservation and restoration of recent years has been co-opted and corrupted by corporate interests, including fossil fuel producers who are among the biggest purchasers of carbon credits.Defenders of emissions trading, however, insist that while such greenwashing must be called out, carbon markets have a role to play. Governments will not provide the necessary funds to protect the world\u2019s rainforests. Therefore there is no alternative but to direct private capital towards them and other carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots. If the existing ways of doing this don\u2019t work, better ones must be developed. Our investigation discovered three projects in Madagascar that were excellent. Carbon market optimists think these results can be replicated.Shell is planning a massive expansion of its offsetting operations. And there is no question that an emissions trading system in which big oil is the largest customer has gone horribly wrong. If carbon credits are to be more than a dangerous distraction from the task of ending our dependence on fossil fuels, they must not be treated as licences to pollute. Instead they should be viewed as a last resort, and companies should only be able to access them as part of an overall net zero strategy. Schemes that charge individuals fees to cancel out emissions from flights or other high-carbon activities should be ended. They do more harm than good by encouraging the idea that lifestyles don\u2019t need to change.The carbon offsets market is worth around $2bn, and is expected to be worth 10 times that by the end of the decade. It is emphatically not the solution to the enormous threat posed by dangerously high emissions. But with much tougher oversight and regulation, it ought to be possible to design a system whereby forested nations are financially incentivised to protect nature. Exposing the weakness in the current system is a necessary first step in that direction.",

Many of these journeys have been called \u201cpolluting and pointless\u201d by Greenpeace, as they are so short they could have easily been taken by train \u2013 and in one case, cycled in 30 minutes.The analysis by the Dutch environmental consultancy CE Delft also found that the number of private jets taking off from the UK increased by 75% between 2021 and 2022 to 90,256 flights, emitting 500,000 tonnes of CO2 \u2013 more than in any other European country.The UK tops all league tables for private jets, boasting the busiest route, the most polluting route and the most flights overall. Flights between London and Paris were the most popular route, accounting for 3,357 flights, and six of the top 10 routes overall also included London.Map showing private jet routesAccording to a Transport & Environment study, private jets are five to 14 times more polluting than commercial planes per passenger, and 50 times more polluting than trains. Previous research found that 50% of all aviation emissions were caused by 1% of the world\u2019s population.The use of private jets appears to be rising. The research found that private jet traffic across Europe rose from 350,000 flights in 2021 to more than 570,000 in 2022, with a heavy impact on emissions. The associated CO2 emissions more than doubled over the same period to more than 3.3m tonnes.Environmental campaigners at Greenpeace are calling for a ban on private jet travel, highlighting that the research shows almost one-in-four (39%) private jet flights in Europe were considered \u201cvery short-haul\u201d meaning they were less than 310 miles (500km) and could easily have been train trips.There were also some staggeringly inefficient routes found in the analysis. A flight between Blackbushe and Farnborough in Hampshire \u2013 which is just 4.6 miles (7.4km) \u2013 topped the charts for the most carbon-intensive route in 2021 and 2022. This is because it takes less than 30 minutes to cycle between the two airports.Doug Parr, the policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cPrivate jets are staggeringly polluting and generally pointless.

Workers who investigate fly-tipping, undertake dredging and are council caretakers will also try the new working pattern.\u2018An undeniable success\u2019: first UK council trial of four-day week set to be extendedRead morePay will remain the same and the council has assured householders that they will receive the same service, if not better. It is hoped that the city council, with whom the district shares waste services, will agree to the plan in the coming months.It could cost \u00a3339,000 extra over two years, according to council papers, as an increase in staff and new lorries are required. Savings are expected to be made by a reduction in the use of agency staff as working on bin crews becomes a more appealing prospect.Joe Ryle, the director of the 4 Day Week Campaign, which has helped steer trials in the private sector, said: \u201cWe have always said the four-day week must apply for everyone, so it is brilliant the first ever trial for blue-collar workers in the public sector has been approved. It\u2019s only fair that public-sector workers and those in non-office jobs benefit too.\u201dThe decision follows the world\u2019s largest trial of a four-day week in the UK, which resulted in 56 of the 61 companies taking part carrying on with the test, and 18 making the arrangement permanent.Companies involved ranged from the Charity Bank in Kent to Rivelin Robotics in Sheffield. Among the firms that struggled were Allcap, an industrial supplies company, which tried a nine-day fortnight and found that after \u201cnine extreme ones \u2013 once [employees] got to their scheduled day off, they were exhausted\u201d.Nevertheless, polling last week showed that 58% of the British public expected a four-day week to be the normal way of working by 2030, with only 22% believing it would not.Bridget Smith, the leader of South Cambridgeshire district council, said that as part of preparations to make the trial a success, bin routes had been rationalised to reduce wasted time and \u201ceverybody will be working more intensely and productively\u201d.Bin crews have typically worked 37-hour weeks \u2013 but the job is known as \u201ctask and finish\u201d, which means it can be done more quickly or slowly.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines UKFree newsletterGet the day\u2019s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Farmers and Tory MPs are joining ranks to clash with conservation authorities about the best way to look after Dartmoor national park.Parts of the national park are worryingly overgrazed, particularly by sheep, say nature experts, which is destroying habitats and putting rare birds at risk of local extinction. Breeding populations of moorland birds such as golden plover, red grouse and ring ouzels have gone or are on the verge of being lost.Natural England, the government nature watchdog, has advised farmers who are in agri-environment schemes and receive government money for nature-friendly farming that they will have to reduce their stocks. It said that in summer, at least 50% of their livestock units should be cattle or ponies rather than sheep, and that \u201cexcept for pony herds, winter grazing will need to be justified through clear and specific environmental outcomes that require winter stocking\u201d.Sources at the quango said that of the three largest moorland sites of special scientific interest (SSSI) \u2013 north Dartmoor, south Dartmoor and east Dartmoor \u2013 none of the key open moorland habitats, such as bog and heath, are considered to be in favourable condition.Critics argue that farmers should not be paid millions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money for environmental stewardship without changing their practices when the habitats are being degraded.But the suggestion has been met with concern by local MPs. Sir Geoffrey Cox, a former attorney general, published a statement with other local Conservative MPs last week saying: \u201cIt seems that valuable and constructive work has now been abandoned by Natural England which has issued apparently peremptory limits on grazing, which would have a significant adverse impact on farm businesses (especially tenants), rendering some, if not many, no longer viable. It would also destroy the ancient traditional hefted flocks, which instinctively know the boundaries of their own common and are themselves a prized part of the unique life and culture of Dartmoor.\u201dCox, Gary Streeter, the MP for South West Devon, and Anthony Mangnall, the MP for Totnes, have asked for the current grazing regime to be kept in place for an extra 12 months, the appointment of an independent facilitator, and then an agreed \u201croadmap\u201d for the way forward.Cox, the MP for Torridge and West Devon, has secured a parliamentary debate later in April where MPs will discuss whether Natural England\u2019s management of the moor is adequate. The farming minister, Mark Spencer, is expected to respond.But sources at Natural England said that while the Conservative MPs talk of the \u201cgrazing traditions\u201d of Dartmoor, sheep have only been grazed there in the winter in the last 60 years when hardy Scottish breeds that could tolerate the freezing, windswept moors were introduced.Dave Slater, the south-west regional director for Natural England, said the grazing changes needed to be made to save rare birds on the moors.\u201cDartmoor contains three of the largest moorland SSSIs in the south-west, but none of these are in a favourable condition, with rare moorland birds all but disappearing from the area and precious peatland habitats damaged. The right type of grazing is fundamental to restoring the health of these moors.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The authors warn that urgent research is needed to assess threats to these mammals.Race to the bottom: the disastrous, blindfolded rush to mine the deep seaRead moreThe research, published in Frontiers in Marine Science, finds that noise pollution in particular could cause damage to the sensitive, intelligent animals.Scientists said the disturbance would be constant for the marine mammals, similar to noisy construction work in a human neighbourhood that was impossible to escape from.\u201cImagine if your neighbourhood was suddenly disrupted by construction work that goes on 24/7, your life would change dramatically. Your mental health would be compromised, you might change your behaviour to escape from it. It\u2019s no different for whales or dolphins,\u201d said Dr Kirsten Thompson, of the University of Exeter. The research concludes that the constant disturbance could cause ill health.Until now, assessments of impacts from mining have focused on seabed species, as this is the direct area mined. However, scientists say the impact on cetaceans and other large animals that may face harm from sound pollution needs to be urgently assessed before permission for commercial mining is given.Dolphins and sperm whales are among the 25 cetacean species found in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) between Mexico and Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean, according to the paper. However, mining companies are interested in extracting metals and minerals from the seafloor in this area, which is believed to be rich in valuable materials. So far 17 exploratory deep sea mining contracts have been granted in this part of the Pacific Ocean.Leaked video footage of ocean pollution shines light on deep-sea miningRead moreThough deep sea mining companies have not yet received permission to start mining commercially, they are asking governments for the green light for the first time this July. Campaigners and scientists warn that if they are allowed to, machines could work 24-hours a day, producing sounds at varying depths that could overlap with the frequencies cetaceans use to communicate.Metals for industry including copper, cobalt, nickel and manganese are in the sea bed, and there are also thought to be rare earth elements such as yttrium, as well as substantial veins of gold, silver and platinum.Louisa Casson, a Greenpeace campaigner, said: \u201cDeep sea mining companies are determined to start plundering the oceans, despite little research about the impacts this industry would have on whales, dolphins and other species.\u201cDeep sea mining could damage the oceans in ways we do not fully understand \u2013 and at the expense of species like blue whales that have been a focus of conservation efforts for many years.

In Sweden, he said, bringing back wolves almost led to a change of government after people\u2019s dogs were eaten.\u201cThese animals only have to consume somebody\u2019s dog and they then become the hound of hell \u2013 and what happens is you end up with more hatred for the animal than before you started, which is counterproductive in the long term,\u201d he said.In recent years, support has grown for the idea of reintroducing species that once lived in the UK, and Mears said there were positive examples, including the successful reintroduction of beavers in Argyll. Some people are now calling for the reintroduction of wolves and lynx, which could help restore forests by keeping roe deer and rabbit populations in check. Scotland and Northumberland have been proposed as suitable locations for wild lynx, which were last seen in Britain more than 1,000 years ago.However, Mears said that such efforts would be challenging. \u201cWe don\u2019t have vast tracts of wilderness, but we have a broken landscape made up of urban conurbation and farmland,\u201d he said.Even in the most remote areas, there is the question of whether predators will settle at the site after they are reintroduced. \u201cThe problem is you can\u2019t contain them,\u201d Mears said. \u201cThey are wild animals. They\u2019re very intelligent, incredibly intelligent.\u201dHe added that while deer often learned to avoid predators, the same was not true of livestock. \u201cThe deer will very quickly learn and become very intelligent \u2026 but the sheep don\u2019t, so the wolf will obviously go for the sheep.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Even raking back $20bn of that boon would fund the government\u2019s entire Rewiring the Nation plan to modernise the grid.\u201cA wide and growing range of experts back a windfall profits tax as an economically responsible way for Australians to receive a fair return for the once-off exploitation of our gas resources,\u201d said Richard Denniss, executive director at the Australia Institute.\u201cMany LNG companies pay little if any income tax and get much of the gas for free as it\u2019s not subject to royalties.\u201cLNG producers in Australia are overwhelmingly foreign-owned, with profits flowing almost entirely overseas.\u201dPressure from industry groups has been mounting on the Albanese government to do more to lower high energy costs, particularly in eastern Australian states. Last month\u2019s deal to secure sufficient gas to avoid supply gaps may only serve to lock in high prices, the groups \u2013 from aluminium smelters to food manufacturers \u2013 have said.Western Australia, which has had a reservation policy keeping 15% of LNG exporters\u2019 supplies for domestic users since 2006, is paying only about $5/gigajoule for gas, state energy minister Bill Johnston told Guardian Australia last week. Since gas costs also influence electricity prices, power bills are also relatively low out west.Industry analysts such as EnergyQuest\u2019s Graeme Bethune said the current supersized earnings of the east coast gas exporters should be weighed against massive writedowns for their projects in earlier years.\u201cWorst of all is Arrow Energy, which so far has cumulative losses of over $8bn,\u201d Bethune told Guardian Australia.Meanwhile, a separate report by Market Forces has found a split has emerged among Australia\u2019s biggest super funds, with some offloading millions of shares in oil and gas giants Woodside and Santos while a few have been accumulating their stock.Its analysis found 11 of the 14 super funds studied owned fewer Santos shares in their default investment options as of 30 June 2022 than six months earlier, based on their latest disclosures.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The walk is one of a series of events for people who want to be part of the next generation of farmers here. I have organised the event with the Farmer Network and the Lake District National Park Authority as part of my National Trust role as future farming partnership manager.As well as working on our family farm, both my son Hector and I have full-time jobs elsewhere, meaning our farm work must be done in the early mornings, evenings and weekends. There is a long tradition of farmers with a \u201cside hustle\u201d; looking back in census records I can see many of my ancestors also worked in mines as well as having a farm.

The hedgerows were planted up over the last winter by Hector and a group of students, made from hawthorn, bird cherry, dog rose and hazel. It has made the space more productive agriculturally, as he can rotationally graze the farm\u2019s flock of hefted Swaledale sheep when they\u2019re not on the fell. The hedges also act as corridors for wildlife \u2013 many birds nested in them this spring, and very soon after their creation there was an explosion of vole activity. There are also hares in the field and curlews nesting in the higher ground.The walk turns north, and we look over a large area that, twice in the last 30 years, has failed to drain successfully to make it more productive. It is now going into a Countryside Stewardship agreement and will become a new fen, with a large bund protecting it from run-off containing nutrients.Crucially, this new fen will hold water in the landscape, making it more resilient to flooding. This area has been terribly hit by floods in recent years, most famously Storm Desmond in 2015. Flood walls have been built or started, but we also need to make interventions in the landscape. As we depart, a rainbow appears where the new fen will be. Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",

Wiener sausages and the popular maasdamer cheese, which has risen by 94% to \u20ac4.84, are among the items to go up most in price. Regarding the cheese, the scientists calculated hidden costs of 85 cents for climate-harming emissions such as methane and CO2, as well as 76 cents for damage to the soil from intensive farming and animal feed production, 63 cents for the effect of pesticides used, including their impact on the health of farmers, as well as 10 cents for pollution of groundwater through the use of fertiliser.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Australia\u2019s rooftops now boast 20 gigawatts of solar panels and will soon have the capacity to produce more electricity than the country\u2019s entire coal industry, according to the industry consultancy SunWiz.Almost one in three Australian households have solar photovoltaics \u2013 or solar panels \u2013 the highest penetration in the world. Queensland had the highest share of solar panels installed on dwellings deemed suitable for the technology with an 82% penetration, ahead of South Australia\u2019s 78%, New South Wales\u2019 51% and Victoria\u2019s 43%.Australian households face steep power bill increases as generation costs soarRead moreThe take-up of solar PV has quickened. It took about 11 years for Australia to reach its first 10GW of capacity, while the second 10GW took just four years, according to SunWiz.Combining the household solar panel capacity with the 11GW of large-scale solar plants, \u201csolar energy is already Australia\u2019s largest fuel source for electrical power in Australia\u201d, according to Warwick Johnston, the managing director of SunWiz.Once AGL Energy closes the remaining units of its 1680MW Liddell coal-fired power station in NSW\u2019s Hunter Valley next month, rooftop solar alone will have more so-called name-plate capacity than Australia\u2019s remaining coal fleet, SunWiz said. That measure refers to the output a device is intended to be able to produce.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nQueensland\u2019s relatively sunny climate has encouraged residents there to host 5.2GW of solar PV, with the 1 millionth rooftop solar panel system to be installed soon. NSW is installing the most additional capacity of any state, with almost 100MW being added monthly, SunWiz said.Rooftop solar is often the largest supplier of electricity during the middle of the day, helping to drive demand in the national electricity market to record lows, including during the December quarter. The relative abundance of solar power, though, is creating challenges for large-scale generators, particularly operators of coal plants that struggle to ramp output up and down to meet fluctuating demand.According to a report by Green Energy Markets for the Clean Energy Regulator, the next 10GW of rooftop solar will take just over three years to be installed.Australia's solar PV demand is increasingly coming from upgrades for households that already have rooftop systems. (Source: Green Energy Markets) pic.twitter.com/6UHobIPbTu\u2014 @phannam@mastodon.green (@p_hannam) February 28, 2023\nTotal installations will near 3GW in 2023 and exceed 3.2GW next year, setting a new annual high after the industry recovered from the Covid-related disruptions to supplies from China.Consumers, too, are increasingly focused on the prospect of power prices rising and staying high, according to Tristan Edis, director of analysis at Green Energy Markets.\u201cThe price of a system had gone up quite a bit\u201d in 2021-22, at a time when electricity prices had started to drop, Edis said. \u201cAnd then kind of all hell broke loose with the forward market,\u201d he said, referring to future prices on the electricity market.The Australian Electricity Regulator in May 2022 lifted its default power prices by as much as 20% in a decision delayed by the Morrison government until after the federal election. Since then, the Albanese government has intervened with price caps for coal and gas in a bid to limit the size of further increases.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About 15% of solar system installations now also include batteries, he said.The prospects for large-scale solar, though, were not so promising, at least in the near-term.\u201cThe pipeline of solar farms under development has dried up, and we expect it to be the worst year for solar farms since Australia started their rollout in earnest in 2018,\u201d Johnston said.\nThe headline on this article was amended on 1 March 2023 to clarify that while solar now has more capacity than other energy sources in Australia, it is not the largest single source of electricity generation.\n",

        "text": "Have you noticed that nobody seems able to behave properly any more? The pandemic, along with modern technology, has caused some of us to forget how to interact with others completely. See, for example, rising incidents of air rage.New York magazine has certainly noticed all this: the media outlet recently published a viral list of 140 rules of modern etiquette to help people navigate our brave new world. Unfortunately, a lot of the rules on the list were somewhat deranged and seemingly aimed at people who spend their days mingling with celebrities, attending \u201cironic birthday parties\u201d and dropping in on gatherings where the hosts put out large bowls of cigarettes as party favours. In other words, not very useful for those of us who lead rather more mundane lives. So, you\u2019ll be thrilled to know, I\u2019ve helpfully put together my own list of rules for modern life that everybody should follow.First, visitor etiquette. If you arrive at someone\u2019s house, what\u2019s the polite way to let them know you\u2019re there? While it seems like a straightforward enough question, customs vary wildly according to generation. People who grew up without phones often (shock horror!) knock or ring the doorbell. Millennials, meanwhile, will text to let you know they\u2019ve arrived. I\u2019m not entirely sure what Gen Z does \u2013 presumably they make a TikTok of themselves arriving. The correct option is to text. I\u2019m not just saying that because I\u2019m an elderly millennial; I\u2019m saying it because hearing someone knocking on your door is objectively terrifying. That\u2019s how a lot of horror movies start.Now for toilet paper orientation, another weirdly contentious issue. It should always hang over the top of the roll. If you are at someone\u2019s house and they\u2019ve made a terrible faux pas and hung it under the roll, then you are allowed to rearrange it for them. It\u2019s only polite.Travel. Having recently sat in a middle seat for several hours I think we all need to get on board with the fact that sitting in the middle means you deserve both armrests \u2013 there should be no debate about this. Also, if you watch something on your phone without headphones on you should be put on the no-fly list.Obviously, I\u2019ve got to mention masks. It seems to be an unpopular opinion these days but I reckon that if you\u2019re in a crowded place such as a plane you should probably just wear one. Is it really that hard? Also, if you\u2019re in a shop and the cashier is wearing a mask then you should put one on, too.Names. If you meet someone with a non-white name (such as, for example, \u201cArwa\u201d) do not ask them what it means. I know you\u2019re trying to be polite but it\u2019s othering and annoying. Do you ask people called Emily or Anna what their name means?OK, moving swiftly on: parenting. Unless they\u2019re harming the child don\u2019t ever, ever judge anyone\u2019s parenting. Believe me, your judgments will come back to haunt you. Pre-child I remember smugly looking down on parents who gave their babies pacifiers (dummies, if you\u2019re reading this in the UK or Australia). As soon as I had a baby, however, I couldn\u2019t get a dummy in her mouth fast enough: those things are magic. And don\u2019t be snobbish about screen time. Screens are a parent\u2019s best friend. Indeed, I think Miss Rachel should be nominated for the Nobel peace prize. (If you know, you know.)I shouldn\u2019t even have to put this next point on the list but, judging by the amount of dog poo on the streets near me, it seems it\u2019s a necessity. Pick up after your dog! I am firmly against the death penalty and the prison state, BUT I think that if you litter or if you don\u2019t pick up after your dog, no penalty is too high. Please do not @ me about this on Twitter: my mind is made up. Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",

Of course she needed long sleeves and closed shoes. The teacher explained that long sleeves provided better protection. If there were any cuts or nicks, a bit of coverage could make a difference.I never made that mistake again. There was a lot to learn at bush kinder, a kindergarten program held in the parklands of inner Melbourne. The theory behind it was great: nature play improves children\u2019s wellbeing, social and emotional development, cognitive language and physical skills \u2013 a string of nice words that I definitely wanted for my daughter. But really I was mainly glad she was outside. No screens. No toys. No equipment. Just what she needed after two years of lockdowns.Three-year-old bush kinder was three hours every week. She went, armed with snacks, gumboots and rain pants. She wore a sticker with a phone number on her back in case she wandered off. (I was told this was a precaution and not something that was likely to happen.) She learned to use a camping toilet even though there was a toilet block with actual plumbing. And she went there rain, hail or shine, recording a new personal best for putting on a rain jacket (hood first, arms in, zip up) in every session.When the fundamentals were mastered, her group did trail walks, exploring the creek, looking at different animals, insects and plants, and observing how they change over the seasons.It was a big step-up the following year. Four-year-old bush kinder was seven and a half hours a week. Every session was an adventure. Angus got a bloody nose and Oscar was stung by a bee. Once Ranger Pete came to talk about fire safety. They built a campfire, learning to read the direction of the smoke before each child placed a stick on the fire.Do yourself and other parents a favour \u2013 lower the bar | Emma WilkinsRead moreHer time outdoors has sparked a kind of curiosity, confidence and resilience that I had not expected.When she found a dead possum in our back yard, she hypothesised, as they did at bush kinder, what had happened. She was not perturbed by the discovery. Instead, she went looking for clues, concluding that it had been attacked by a naughty cat and not a watchful owl. She was certain that it was in fact a possum and not a rat or a mouse (because of its size). She said she would report it to Ranger Pete.Her confidence comes from being organised and prepared. The sticker on her back is a lesson in letting someone know where you are. When I forgot to put one on her she reminded me to do it. We checked the weather the night before every session and decided what to wear and pack together.On the eve of a 37C day, her dad and I weren\u2019t sure if we should send her. She was only four. It wasn\u2019t bootcamp. But we were assured by the teachers that the children learn to find shade and stay hydrated. We could call any time and parents whose child could benefit from an early pickup would be notified.So she went along with two frozen water bottles, watermelon and ice packs to keep her lunch cool. We got the call to pick her up an hour early. She had managed six hours. She didn\u2019t love it. She was cross with me for taking so long to get her. But by the time bush kinder came around again, it was already forgotten.I feel incredibly lucky to have had this for her. Her program is considered and well planned. There are policies and controls covering emergency evacuation, dog awareness, snake awareness and more. I had not read any of them at the start but I have read them all now. She is kept safe while still being exposed to unpredictability.She starts school next year and there is a lot of talk of \u201cschool readiness\u201d. Bush kinder hasn\u2019t taught her numbers or letters but it has given her stories, experiences and life skills that will ground her for years to come. She is ready no matter what path she takes, whatever the weather may be. Lucille Wong is a Melbourne writer and a mother of two",

They included plans to improve the quality of marine protected areas, reduce pollution and nitrogen runoff in the river system, and restore more than half a million hectares of wildlife-rich habitat outside protected areas by 2042.But documents obtained by Unearthed, Greenpeace\u2019s investigative journalism unit, show that the government\u2019s own adviser Natural England said ministers needed to agree a target of restoring 1.5m hectares of habitat outside existing protected sites, three times greater than the final target, if they wanted to meet a commitment to protect 30% of land and sea. They went on to suggest a minimum target of 750,000 hectares.BBC will not broadcast Attenborough episode over fear of \u2018rightwing backlash\u2019Read moreUK negotiators played a leading role in pushing for a global target to protect 30% of land and sea by 2030, known as 30x30, but conservationists say that documents, obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request, show the government ignored scientific advice on how to achieve it domestically while advocating for it elsewhere.At Cop15, the UK was accused of hypocrisy for not making the 30% target legally binding while pushing for it in the final text, which conservationists said was a missed opportunity to protect and restore Britain\u2019s rainforests, cold water coral reefs, chalk streams and peat bogs.\u201cWe all found absolutely extraordinary last year when the government didn\u2019t put forward a target for protected areas.

Many records were smashed in 2023, which will be the hottest year on record. Global heating means there is more energy in the atmosphere, making extreme weather events more frequent and more intense.Bar chart showing monthly average global temperature anomalies over timeThe consequences: rising sea levelsSea levels are inexorably rising as ice on land melts and hotter oceans expand.

The C-IRG has faced accusations of harassment, racism and excessive force \u2013 allegations the unit\u2019s leadership has denied.The unit is currently the target of a lawsuit alleging it used \u201cunlawful tactics\u201d to dismantle the Fairy Creek protest, and is also linked to a broader press freedom lawsuit after RCMP officers detained two journalists reporting on police efforts to tear down blockades against the Coastal GasLink pipeline on traditional Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territory.\u2018I felt kidnapped\u2019: Canada police sued for arresting photographer covering protestRead moreThe RCMP oversight body says it will assess whether the unit\u2019s operations are consistent with Canada\u2019s charter of rights and freedoms, as well as recently passed legislation on the United Nations declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples. The force has said it will also ensure the unit\u2019s actions align with recommendations from a national inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.The chair of the oversight group, Michelaine Lahaie, is not part of the RCMP.The C-IRG unit, staffed with volunteer RCMP officers, was originally formed in 2017 to help resource-extraction protests proceed by breaking up public protest and blockades. The unit has cost nearly C$50m over the past five years, according to CBC News.The CRCC has the ability to examine the conduct of individual officers to determine if policies or training need to change, the RCMP said.The RCMP said in a statement it had anticipated the investigation.\u201cWe knew about the possibility for a review and have been working cooperatively to ensure that the CRCC have comprehensive access and a fulsome understanding of the C-IRG\u2019s policies, procedures, practices, guidelines, training and deployments,\u201d Staff Sgt Kris Clark, a media relations officer, said.",

It was always a mistake to call it the green prosperity plan. A bunch of us are now saying to Rachel it should be used for capital spending even if it\u2019s not explicitly green.\u201dAnother Labour source said: \u201cOur industrial strategy and securonomics approach to the economy will mean that we will need to use available public capital more widely than just for net zero projects.\u201dGreen activists have pushed back on the idea of dropping the plan\u2019s focus on environmentalism however.Chris Venables, deputy director of politics at the Green Alliance, said: \u201cThe primary issue at the general election will be the cost of living, but the solution to an economic crisis driven by a volatile fossil fuel market is to get ourselves off gas.\u201dReeves first unveiled the plan to spend \u00a328bn a year on climate measures two years ago, promising to be the UK\u2019s \u201cfirst green chancellor\u201d, and it remains the party\u2019s biggest spending pledge. The party has already committed to using parts of the fund for a range of green schemes, including \u00a360bn to pay for home insulation and \u00a38bn to invest in green industries.Labour sources say that Reeves has indicated to colleagues there will be no additional money to pay for major infrastructure spending, leaving shadow ministers battling to claim a share of the green fund for their own projects.Labour is nervous about any suggestion of making uncosted spending pledges, with Paul Johnson, the head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, warning that any new Labour commitments are likely to require tax rises.One shadow minister said: \u201cWe are all competing for that capital spending at the moment because Rachel Reeves won\u2019t let any other spending happen and won\u2019t allow any other tax rises.\u201dA Labour spokesperson said: \u201cThe green prosperity plan, along with all of our policies, is subject to our fiscal rules being met and fiscal stability being maintained as we seek to tackle climate change \u2013 one of the biggest challenges of our time \u2013 in a way that cuts bills and creates good jobs and energy security in the process.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In December, imports from China were more than double a year earlier.The increase made China the fourth-largest import source, narrowing the gap with larger rivals. Cars sourced from Japan still dominate, making up just less than a third of the market of 1.1m vehicles even as sales declined almost 6% for the year.

By contrast, 2023 EV sales in Europe were headed for 3m and in the US only 2m.The chief executive of Australia\u2019s Electric Vehicle Council, Behyad Jafari, said Australians were increasingly comfortable buying Chinese-made cars, including EVs. Well known brands, such US-based Teslas, and Polestar, a Volvo offshoot, sourced the cars they sold in Australia from their Chinese factories.The rise of Chinese automakers will probably quicken the transition off petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles particularly as their lower-cost offerings enable more Australians to make the switch, Jafari predicted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the analysis examined the proportion of flood defences in disrepair rather than the number because thousands more assets have been built since 2018.Experts said the picture of disrepair was likely to worsen after higher costs and budget shortfalls forced the Environment Agency to axe a quarter of its new flood defence projects.Georgia Whitaker, Greenpeace UK\u2019s climate campaigner, said the analysis painted a \u201cgrim and desperate picture\u201d.Graph plotting state of district flood defences v level of flood riskShe said there was \u201cabsolutely no excuse for this lack of preparation\u201d from the government, and added: \u201cIf politicians fail to commit to crucial climate action, they risk being punished at the ballot box.\u201dIn total, 4,204 of England\u2019s most important flood defences were in a poor or very poor condition in 2022. This accounts for about one in 15 of the total, up from the one in 25 registered four years ago.Of these, 856 were judged very poor, meaning they had \u201csevere defects resulting in complete performance failure\u201d, essentially rendering them useless.The remaining 3,348 were in poor condition, meaning they have defects that would \u201csignificantly reduce\u201d their performance.The government\u2019s environment department (Defra) claimed that more than 61,500 flood defences met the required condition and that 2,400 did not, but the Guardian has not been able to verify this data.A spokesperson said mitigation measures, such as increased inspections, would be put in place when assets were not found to be in the right standard.Defra said: \u201cFlooding can be devastating to communities \u2013 which is why we are investing a record \u00a35.2bn between 2021 and 2027 to better protect hundreds of thousands of properties, including over \u00a3200m a year for maintaining of flood defences.\u201dThe Environment Agency has slashed the number of homes it expects to protect from flooding over the next five years as higher costs have forced it to scale back projects.A National Audit Office report last month said the agency had pledged to protect 336,000 properties from the risk of flooding by 2027 \u2013 but that this had been cut to 200,000 \u2013 a reduction of 40%.The Environment Agency also removed 500 of the 2,000 new flood defence projects originally included in its six-year flood and coastal erosion programme.",

Municipal utilities will be required to remove the compounds from drinking water, which could set off a wave of lawsuits directed at PFAS polluters, including the US military and chemical producers like 3M, DuPont and Chemours.Toxic \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 found in toilet paper around the worldRead moreThe new rules are \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d, said Erik Olson, senior strategic director for the Natural Resources Defense Council non-profit, which tracks PFAS pollution.\u201cWe have a five-alarm fire, and setting strong standards will help ensure the fundamental right of every family to have safe water flowing from their kitchen tap,\u201d he said.PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 14,000 chemicals often used to make products resist water, stains and heat. They are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down, and are linked to cancer, liver problems, thyroid issues, birth defects, kidney disease, decreased immunity and other serious health problems.By some estimates, PFAS are contaminating drinking water for more than 200 million Americans, and the EPA has said it has moved more quickly to regulate the compounds than any in the agency\u2019s history.Between 2016 and 2022, the agency worked off an advisory health limit of 70 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOS and PFOA, two compounds commonly produced and used for decades. Last year, after science showed virtually no level of exposure to drinking water is safe, the EPA set non-enforceable \u201cadvisory health limits\u201d of 0.02 ppt and 0.004 ppt for PFOA and PFOS, respectively.The new legal limits for PFOS and PFOA is 4 ppt each, levels that science shows are still dangerous to drink. Public health advocates say the discrepancy is likely the result of industry pressure on the EPA and an inability of PFAS tests that regulators use to check water for the chemicals at levels as low as 0.02 ppt.Though chemical manufacturers say they voluntarily phased out production of PFOS and PFOA about a decade ago, the compounds persist in large quantities in the environment and Americans\u2019 blood because they take decades to degrade.\u201cIs 4 ppt where we would like to be? Absolutely not, and that\u2019s why the EPA has much lower health advisories,\u201d said Linda Birnbaum, a former head of the US National Toxicology Program and EPA scientist. \u201cBut it is a heck of a lot better than the previous advisory of 70 ppt.\u201dWhat are PFAS, how toxic are they and how do you become exposed?Read moreAs industry phased out the chemicals, it introduced a new generation of PFAS it claimed were safe alternatives, including GenX and PFBS. However, an ever-growing body of scientific evidence has found those to be nearly as toxic as the first generation.The EPA set a variable \u201chealth hazard index\u201d that includes PFBS, GenX, PFHxS and PFNA. The approach requires the chemicals to be removed from water when one or more in the combination pose a health risk.Though public health advocates largely praised the limits, they note that it addresses only six out of about 14,000 PFAS compounds, and they called on the EPA to regulate the entire chemical class. The state of Maine and the European Union are moving to regulate the chemicals as a class. Federal class regulation \u201ccannot come soon enough\u201d, said David Andrews, a senior scientist with the Environmental Working Group non-profit.\u201cThese six PFAS stand out as some of the most well-studied PFAS, but the entire class of chemicals are a health concern,\u201d he said.",

But he cannot simply wave away the rules in his own ministerial code.\u201cLike every other member of the cabinet, when it is essential to travel by air he is supposed to use scheduled flights where possible because that is cheaper for the taxpayer and better for the environment. If those are still the rules, then he needs to explain why he has not followed them.\u201dIn recent months, Sunak has used a helicopter for an official visit to Southampton, and flown to London from Dorset by helicopter before returning to the south-west of England by plane the next morning. He has previously used private helicopters to travel from London to his constituency, at a cost of about \u00a316,000.",

It leaves the fund needing about $40m before the end of the year to formally launch, according to GEF rules.While the formal creation of the fund has been welcomed, countries including Japan, the US and EU states have been urged to contribute.The interim UN biodiversity chief, David Cooper, said: \u201cIt is encouraging to see the contributions already announced by Canada and the UK as well as the statements by a number of countries that further pledges will be forthcoming shortly.\u201cWe are off to a good start. We now call for further pledges from countries and from other sources so the first projects under the new fund can be launched next year ahead of Cop16.\u201dThe World Wide Fund for Nature said creating the fund was an important achievement as it would provide a new revenue stream for biodiversity conservation. However it warned that more money must be contributed before the biodiversity Cop16 next year, which still had an uncertain venue after Turkey said it could not longer host because of the impact of recent earthquakes.In the closing statement for the GEF summit, the activism organisation Avaaz said: \u201cWe are still wondering where France, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Japan, the US and the other major donor countries were. Why did they not step up when urgency is called for in every single meeting, session, speech?\u201dCanada\u2019s environment minister, Steven Guilbeault, told the Guardian support for the fund from developed countries was important for meeting this decade\u2019s biodiversity targets, which included restoring large areas of degraded ecosystems, reforming $500bn of environmentally damaging subsidies and urgent actions to halt human-caused extinctions of species known to be under threat and to promote their recovery.He said: \u201cIn Montreal, we overcame years of inertia to reach a historic multilateral biodiversity deal, including agreement that ambitious action requires greater financial support. Since then, devastating climate-related events that significantly impact biodiversity, including historic and destructive wildfires, have only strengthened our resolve.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

An attempt to include it as a late amendment to the recent Public Order Act 2023 failed to pass the Lords in January.Braverman told MPs on Wednesday the new powers would enable police to take quicker action against slow-walking protests and those that brought \u201cchaos to the law-abiding majority\u201d.But in its pre-action letter, the first step to a judicial review, Liberty said her move violated the constitutional principle of the separation of powers, because the measures had already been rejected by parliament.Katy Watts, a lawyer for the human rights organisation, said: \u201cThe home secretary has sidelined parliament to sneak in new legislation via the back door, despite not having the powers to do so.\u201cThis has been done deliberately in a way which enables the government to circumvent parliament \u2013 who voted these same proposals down just a few months ago \u2013 and is a flagrant breach of the separation of powers that exist in our constitution.\u201cWe\u2019ve launched this legal action to ensure this overreach is checked, and that the government is not allowed to put itself above the law to do whatever it wants. It\u2019s really important the government respects the law and that today\u2019s decision is reversed immediately.\u201dThe Home Office confirmed it had received Liberty\u2019s letter. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe right to protest is a fundamental part of our democracy but we must also protect the law-abiding majority\u2019s right to go about their daily lives. That is why have introduced a new definition of serious disruption, to give police the confidence they need to clear roads quickly. The was voted on by both the House of Commons and House of Lords, following proper parliamentary procedure.\u201dThe regulations, a response to daily roads protests by climate activists, lower the threshold for what constitutes \u201cserious disruption\u201d to the public from \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201cprolonged\u201d to \u201cmore than minor\u201d. One legal expert has suggested the change will give police \u201cnear total discretion\u201d over which protests to allow and which to curtail. Liberty says the regulations now give police \u201calmost unlimited powers\u201d to stop protestsBraverman said on Monday that the public had \u201clost their patience\u201d with Just Stop Oil, the climate activist group that has staged 156 slow marches in London in the past six weeks. \u201cThe police must be able to stop this happening and it\u2019s our job in government to give them the powers to do so,\u201d she told the Commons as it passed the measure.But the use of secondary legislation to push through a rejected proposal has prompted accusations that the government is flouting democracy by playing fast and loose with constitutional laws. A cross-party committee of peers recently said it was the first time a government had tried such a move.Secondary legislation is law created by ministers under powers given to them by acts of parliament. It is used to fill in the details of acts, so they can be swiftly adapted to changing circumstances. But increasing use of secondary legislation to fill in so-called \u201cskeleton bills\u201d has led to concerns of a shift in power towards the executive.On Tuesday night, peers accused the Home Office of authoritarian and disreputable behaviour as they backed, by 177 votes to 141, a so-called regret motion proposed by Labour that criticised the process and urged the withdrawal of the provisions.Vernon Coaker, Labour\u2019s home affairs spokesperson in the Lords, said: \u201cIt is an absolute fundamental constitutional outrage, what has actually taken place. Primary legislation was defeated. So what does the government do? It doesn\u2019t bring forward new primary legislation; it tries to sneak through, in an underhand way, secondary legislation without proper public consultation. They undermine the workings of our parliamentary democracy and, as such, it is shocking.\u201dA rare fatal motion brought by Jenny Jones of the Green party that aimed to kill off the regulations was defeated by 154 to 68. Labour had refused to back it, despite calls from Lady Jones and a 64,000-strong petition.The crossbench peer David Pannick KC also called the government\u2019s move a constitutional outrage. The leading constitutional lawyer added: \u201cAll we can do \u2026 is express regret: we are very sorry about this.\u201cWell, I express regret that the Labour frontbench is not prepared to see through the implications of its own view that this is a constitutional outrage. It is something that we should stand up against and vote against.\u201d",

Males can weigh up to 600g, and grow to the size of a small domestic cat.Researchers tracked northern quolls during seven weeks of the breeding season, using accelerometers contained in miniature felt backpacks.Their study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, found that male quolls rested for only about 8% of the time, while females spent three times as long (24% of the time) resting. The team retrieved data from seven males and six females.The male quolls also spent more time on the move. Two males the researchers named Moimoi and Cayless travelled 10.4km and 9.4km respectively in one night \u2013 the human equivalent of walking around 35 to 40km, they estimate.\u201cThe males are investing all this energy into \u2026 looking for the females, because that\u2019s how they maximise their reproductive output. But they\u2019re just not resting in between,\u201d said Dr Christofer Clemente, study co-author and a senior lecturer in animal ecophysiology at USC.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nBecause they measured time spent resting, the researchers cannot say for certain whether sleep deprivation is the culprit, but they believe it would account for the gradual deterioration and eventual die-off of males.It \u201ccould explain the causes of death recorded in the males after breeding season (eg they become easy prey, unable to avoid collisions, or die from exhaustion),\u201d they wrote.\u201cBy the end of the breeding season, these quolls just look terrible,\u201d Clemente said. \u201cThey start to lose their fur, they start to not be able to groom themselves efficiently, they lose weight and \u2026 they\u2019re constantly fighting with each other as well.\u201dPrevious research has shown that sleep-deprived rodents exhibit similar problems. In mammals, semelparity is rare and only known to occur in some marsupials, including the antechinus, a genus of mice-like native animals whose males experience a cortisol spike after breeding that results in organ breakdown.Male northern quolls do not show the same hormonal changes as the antechinus.Other semelparous animals include Pacific salmon, whose males and females die after swimming upstream to spawn at their birthplace, and some species of octopus.Unusual sightings of \u2018devil bird\u2019 across Melbourne raise migration mysteries for researchersRead moreDr Vera Weisbecker, an associate professor in evolutionary biology at Flinders University, who was not involved in the research, described semelparity as \u201ca really extreme mode of reproduction\u201d that yielded interesting evolutionary insights.\u201c[Natural] selection is easier to see in something that reproduces really, really quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when you have a semelparous species where the males constantly die off, that means we can expect to see evolution at work more easily.\u201dWeisbecker added that the northern quoll had an unusually large distribution, ranging from Queensland and the northern parts of the country to the Pilbara region in Western Australia.However, the animals are threatened by cane toad poisoning, competition with invasive predators and habitat fragmentation.\u201cWe have individual groups of animals that survive on their own but they\u2019re separated by really large gaps,\u201d Weisbecker said.The Groote Eylandt study forms part of broader research into quoll behaviour and predator-prey interactions, which Clemente hopes may inform conservation management planning.",

But a muddy piece of land in west Somerset was unveiled with a fanfare on Wednesday by the conservation charity, which sees this unassuming-looking plot as a pioneering project that could revolutionise the way some rivers are managed.Under the stage-zero restoration project at the Holnicote estate, a section of the River Aller has been liberated from its narrow artificial channel. This allows the water to find its own way, creating streams, pools and boggy ground, a landscape that is better for flora and fauna. Moreover, the slower flow makes flooding less probable downstream.\u201cIt\u2019s not neat and tidy. In fact, it\u2019s a bit of a squelchy mess,\u201d said the project manager, Ben Eardley, as he surveyed the spot. \u201cGood-quality habitat is a patchy kind of mess, but within it, there is diversity \u2013 life.\u201dThe project, which is said to be a first in the UK and was inspired by schemes in the wilds of Oregon in the north-west of the United States, involves a three-quarters-of-a-mile stretch of the Aller being set free. More than 4,000 tonnes of earth was moved to fill the channel and 700 tonnes of fallen timber harvested from the estate was placed within the floodplain.The area before work began. Photograph: National TrustIt has been three years in the making and has cost \u00a3650,000, about \u00a3200,000 more than was anticipated. \u201cThere were a few squeaky-bum moments,\u201d Eardley said. \u201cAfter all, we were filling in a river. It was quite nervy.\u201dBut he said that six weeks on from the \u201criver reset\u201d, there had been spectacular results on the 27-hectare (66-acre) site. Fields previously dry and barren are now wet and vibrant.Eardley said almost instantly, hundreds of swallows and house martins arrived to feast upon the insects that the scheme encouraged; white egrets have been spotted and buzzards and kestrels soar and hover above the site.A rapid increase in the number of bats has been noted, and dragonflies skim over the water. Fish, including eel, were temporarily removed during the works and have started to move back into their new home.\u201cIt\u2019s been staggering,\u201d said Eardley. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex, dynamic landscape. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve lost until you see what you can have. Wetlands are like rainforests in the amount of wildlife in them and their ability to store carbon.\u201dAn aerial view of the project under way. Photograph: National TrustThe site has been given a helping hand. Wildflower seeds, including wild carrot, devil\u2019s bit scabious, meadowsweet and greater tussock-sedge have been planted, along with 25,000 wetland trees, including willow, bird cherry and black poplar.Eardley said pressures on space in much of the UK meant it was almost impossible to bring back wildernesses. \u201cThis is about developing elements of wilderness in the landscape,\u201d he said, adding that the biggest challenge had been to tackle the desire to control. \u201cIt\u2019s almost going against human nature.\u201dThe project does not stop here. Holnicote has two families of beavers \u2013 12 in all \u2013 living in two large enclosures. The hope is one day to reintroduce the animals into the wild on this stretch of river.Matt Pang, the catchment coordinator at the Environment Agency, said there was some surprise when the scheme was mooted. \u201cAn application to fill in a river? That never happens,\u201d he said.Pang admitted it had been difficult, if not impossible, to model what would happen, but said it would be monitored closely and could inform later schemes. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important project,\u201d he said.Mike Stanton, the chair of Somerset Rivers Authority, said that if similar projects were introduced above the Somerset Levels, flooding could be alleviated there. \u201cThere are lessons to be learned here for other parts of Somerset and other areas of the UK. It\u2019s great to see it flourishing.\u201d",

Before the climate crisis, such an extreme event would have been expected only once in a least 40,000 years, making it statistically impossible on human timescales.The scientists said such heat early in the year was especially harmful to people, who were less prepared than in summer. Farmers were already suffering under a prolonged drought and the heatwave struck at an important time in the crop-growing season, particularly for wheat.Extreme temperatures in the region are increasing faster than predicted by climate models \u2013 a problem that worries scientists \u2013 and intensive research is in progress to understand the reasons.Human-caused global heating was already known to be increasing the severity and frequency of heatwaves. But the number of extreme events that would have been essentially impossible without the climate crisis is rising, destroying lives and livelihoods across the planet.In April, scientists showed that the devastating drought in the Horn of Africa would not have happened without global heating. A Guardian analysis in 2022 found that at least a dozen serious events, from killer heatwaves to broiling seas, would have been all but impossible without human-caused global heating.\u201cThe heatwave was a rare event in current climates, but an event of this extremity would have been almost impossible in the past colder climates, and we will see more intense and more frequent heatwaves in the future,\u201d said Dr Sjoukje Philip at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, one of the researchers who conducted the study as part of the World Weather Attribution collaboration.\u201cThe Mediterranean is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change in Europe,\u201d said Dr Friederike Otto, at Imperial College London, who was one of the study team. \u201cThese heatwaves are definitely not going away, so these kinds of conditions will occur ever more frequently until we stop emitting greenhouse gases.\u201dRevealed: how climate breakdown is supercharging toll of extreme weatherRead moreDr Fatima Driouech, at the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Morocco, who was also part of the research team, said: \u201cThe intense heatwave came on top of a multi-year drought, exacerbating the lack of water in the region and threatening 2023 crop yields.\u201dThe researchers used peer-reviewed methods to assess the influence of global heating on the 26-28 April heatwave, and the results are the fastest yet for such a study, produced in just a week. The heatwave brought temperatures never previously recorded in the four countries at that time of the year, ranging from 36.9C to 41.0C.The team used weather data and climate models to compare the likelihood of the high temperatures in today\u2019s warmer world with their likelihood before the climate crisis. They found that global heating had made the heatwave at least 100 times more likely, with temperatures up to 3.5C hotter than they would have been without global heating.Heatwaves tend to be the deadliest type of extreme weather, the scientists said. Mortality data from the April heatwave is not yet available, but heatwaves in 2022 led to nearly 4,000 deaths in Spain and more than 1,000 deaths in Portugal.Roop Singh, at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, said: \u201cThe results of the study indicate the need to work more urgently to put in place adaptations known to reduce heat-related mortality.\u201d Lisbon, for example, has reduced the city heat-island effect by increasing the area covered by green spaces and water features.",

Instead of throwing into the bin a pair of ripped trousers, a bag with a broken strap or a moth-eaten polo neck, the state will pay for them to be mended at your local cobbler or retoucheur (sewing workshops). From October and for the next five years, we will be able to claim back between \u20ac6-\u20ac25 of the costs of mending our clothes and shoes with artisans who have joined the scheme.The hope is to help create a virtuous circle, change habits for the planet\u2019s sake (700,000 tonnes of clothing is thrown away in France every year), sustain local artisans and even create jobs in what we now need to call the \u201crefashion\u201d sector.

Thick end of pork belly is one of my family\u2019s favourite roasting joints, with a strong ratio of crackling to meat; the meat itself is super-rich and fatty, so even a small portion satiates. The leftovers are delicious cold, and even just a couple of tablespoons can be turned into fancy sliders. If you are lucky enough to have any crackling left over, too, chop it up finely and turn that crisp goodness through the pulled meat.Leftover roast pork sliders with fennel, pear and gherkin slawThere\u2019s a fair bit of work involved with slow roasting and pulling meat, especially for sliders, but each one needs only a small amount of meat, so they\u2019re a great way to use up leftovers \u2013 just two tablespoons of leftover meat is enough to stuff a slider bun generously.Few supermarkets stock slider buns, so if you can\u2019t find any, use halved hot dog buns, or make your own. I make mine with whole wheat, using a standard bread recipe, and they\u2019re surprisingly quick to make if you use fast-action yeast.I made a fennel, pear and gherkin slaw to go with the meat, and used some of the gherkin brine as a dressing.

        "text": "The UK could pull out of the international energy charter treaty if attempts to reform it fail, the energy minister, Graham Stuart, has said.The energy charter treaty (ECT) is a system of secret courts that enables companies to sue governments over policies that would cut their future profits. Companies have sued over phasing out coal-fired power stations, ending offshore oil drilling and banning fracking, with some receiving large taxpayer-funded payouts.Critics of the ECT include the European Union, which says staying in the treaty would \u201cclearly undermine\u201d climate targets. France, Germany, Spain and eight other countries have already said they will leave and the EU is also set to pull out en masse. The UK and Japan are the only major economies not to have committed to exiting the ECT.The UK has been a \u201cstrong advocate\u201d of reforming the treaty but the intention to leave it by numerous countries has created an impasse. Stuart said that if the reforms were not passed by November, the UK would consider withdrawal.\u201cRather than being stuck indefinitely with an outdated treaty, the UK wants to see an agreement on a modernised treaty as quickly as possible,\u201d Stuart said. \u201cIn its current form, the ECT will not support those countries looking to make the transition to cleaner, cheaper energy sources and could even penalise our country for being at the forefront of those efforts.\u201dCleodie Rickard, trade campaign manager at Global Justice Now, said: \u201cIt is welcome to hear the UK is finally willing to review its membership of the climate-wrecking ECT. But putting off the decision until November looks like an attempt to keep the UK sitting on the fence.\u201d\u201cThe reform process to this treaty has failed,\u201d she said. \u201cEleven countries are voting with their feet and exiting, meaning there is not enough support to get the so-called modernisation through. Rather than more dither and delay, the UK should be joining a co-ordinated withdrawal now to maximise the benefits of leaving this damaging deal.\u201dThe UK\u2019s official advisers, the Climate Change Committee, said in July that the UK should quit the ECT because \u201ccontinued membership represents risks to both a timely climate transition and to the taxpayer\u201d. ECT critics have estimated the compensation to fossil fuel companies could rise to more than $1tn.Chris Skidmore, a former UK energy minister who led a net zero review for the government in 2022, has said the ECT was being \u201cweaponised by fossil fuel companies in order to sue governments for introducing climate policies\u201d and was a \u201cthreat to the UK\u2019s net zero ambitions\u201d. Skidmore has proposed an amendment to energy bill being considered in parliament next week requiring the UK to withdraw from the ECT.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Kevin Rudd has called for solar panels to be made compulsory on all new buildings and increased incentives to be offered to households that do not yet have them as part of a \u201cgenuinely green recovery\u201d from recession.Speaking at an Australian National University event on Monday, the former prime minister repeated his 2007 declaration that climate change was the \u201cgreat moral challenge of our time\u201d and accused the Morrison government of putting jobs and long-term living standards at risk by failing to deal with the issue as promised under the Paris agreement.Rudd said the government could have used the coronavirus pandemic as a spur to accelerate the shift to becoming a zero emissions economy, but had instead used it as an excuse to delay action further. It was evidence Australia had become \u201cthe complacent country\u201d on the issue despite the experience of last summer\u2019s catastrophic bushfires, he said.\u201cBesides the United States under [Donald] Trump and Brazil under [Jair] Bolsonaro, we in Australia are the only major economy that does not take the need for action on climate change seriously. Nor do we recognise the economic opportunities that will come with that action. I would argue this is bad company to keep,\u201d Rudd said as part of his keynote address at the Wilson Dialogue.\u201cI fear that seeking to untangle our carbon-intensive economy much later than the rest of the world could in fact be what causes the next recession in Australia as the global economy increasingly walks away from fossil fuel dependency.\u201d'Culture of fear': why Kevin Rudd is determined to see an end to Murdoch's media dominanceRead moreRudd said his vision for a green recovery from the pandemic included large-scale investment in renewable energy to position as a clean energy superpower, saying there was evidence it could create \u201cnew jobs, new industries, new wealth\u201d while providing clean energy at home and creating clean energy technology that could be exported.He said it should include investments in projects such as the Asian Renewable Energy Hub, which proposes a massive green hydrogen development in the Pilbara, and contrasted clean energy opportunities with what he said was the government\u2019s obsession with a \u201cgas-led recovery\u201d. He said it would \u201ckiss goodbye\u201d any hope of Australia meeting its commitments under the Paris agreement. \u201cIt is the modern-day equivalent of a defence plan to buy more horses and bayonets because they worked in the past,\u201d he said.Rudd backed a $20bn proposal by the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, to rebuild the power grid and invoked the advice of his former Treasury head, Ken Henry, during the global financial crisis to \u201cgo hard, go early and go households\u201d by also making solar panels mandatory on all new structures, offering increased incentives for retrofitting the three-quarters of existing homes without panels and considering subsidising the cost of insulation for social housing.\u201cIt would immediately put money in the pockets of our countries\u2019 most vulnerable by wiping out huge parts of their electricity bills,\u201d he said.Rudd joined the former Liberal prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in supporting a proposal by Beyond Zero Emissions, an energy and climate change thinktank, saying it could create 100,000 jobs over two years, 70% of them in regional areas, while increasing real wages. It would involve accelerating private and public investment in renewable energy, clean buildings, clean transport, manufacturing and land use that will happen in the years ahead anyway.The former Labor leader was accused of walking away from his commitment to tackle the climate crisis in 2010 when he shelved plans to introduce a carbon pollution reduction scheme after the Copenhagen climate conference failed and Tony Abbott, a climate denier, became Liberal leader. It played a part in his being ousted as prime minister by his Labor colleagues a short time later. A carbon-pricing scheme was later introduced under his successor, Julia Gillard, with crossbench support before being repealed by the Abbott led-Coalition in 2014.Rudd is waging a campaign against Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp, having launched a petition calling for a royal commission into the company\u2019s dominance of Australia media.By Monday night the petition had more than 330,000 signatures, but it is unlikely to be acted upon. Unlike other countries, including Britain, Australia has no threshold of signatures that requires a petition to be debated in parliament.In his speech, Rudd urged people to \u201claunch, collectively, a national fusillade against the Murdoch media\u201d, which he said had been the \u201cecho-chamber of climate change denialism for the best part of a decade\u201d.",

It is banned in the EU but the UK has provisionally agreed to its emergency use every year since leaving the bloc. In 2017, the then environment secretary, Michael Gove, promised to use Brexit to ban all neonicotinoids.Government scientific advisers said in September they were not able to support an authorisation for Cruiser SB, because the \u201cpotential adverse effects to honeybees and other pollinators outweigh the likely benefits\u201d.Now a group of businesses that depend on pollinators, including some farmers and those who use botanicals in their products, have said the government must heed their advice and not allow bee-killing pesticides to be used.In a letter to Mark Spencer, the farming minister, Anabel Kindersley, the chief executive of Neal\u2019s Yard Remedies, Tim Mead, the head of Yeo Valley, as well as the boards of Lush and the Body Shop have asked him to block Cruiser SB from use.\u201cWe need to listen to the scientists. Excessive pesticide use is killing our bees and other essential insect species that we rely on for a healthy, safe and clean environment,\u201d they wrote.\u201cA single teaspoon of neonicotinoid is enough to deliver a lethal dose to 1.25bn bees. One-third of the UK bee population has disappeared in the last decade, and since 1900 the UK has lost 13 out of 35 native bee species.\u201cMany UK businesses rely on a healthy pollinator population to uphold the high standards of our products. We need sustainable agricultural practices that don\u2019t harm our ecosystem.\u201dSugar beet has one of the highest profit margins of any crop grown in the UK but growers fear these could be hit by virus yellows, a disease spread by aphids, which can decrease crop production.Seeds are treated with Cruiser SB and this kills the aphids. However, the pesticide spreads into the soil, meaning any wildflower that grows in it is toxic to the bees that visit to pollinate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Campaigners are particularly concerned about the huge carbon majors it has as clients, including Total, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, ENI, Repsol and Equinor. These companies are involved in more than 200 new fossil fuel projects scheduled for approval by 2025, which would collectively produce about 8.6bn tonnes of carbon dioxide.The bank began planning an exit from coal in 2019 and now says its remaining thermal coal exposure is \u201conly residual\u201d. In 2021, it joined the UN\u2019s Net Zero Banking Alliance.But it has been slower to act on oil and gas. The bank has been in the spotlight recently as one of several banks to loan money to TotalEnergies for the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), despite deciding not to finance the hugely controversial project in 2021. EACOP would emit vast amounts of carbon and have a huge impact on the people living along its path.Lorette Philippot, the campaigner at Friends of the Earth France, accused BNP Paribas of \u201cignoring scientific truths\u201d.\u201cThe urgent warning professed by the scientific community and the International Energy Agency has recently been reiterated through repeated statements from the United Nations: a bank cannot claim to be committed to net zero while supporting new oil and gas projects.\u201dBNP Paribas had been served notice that the NGOs were prepared to take legal action last year if it did not change its policies, and in January the bank promised to cut financing for the extraction and production of oil by 80% and gas by 30% by 2030. It said it would focus on supply and low-emission gas power plants, in line with EU investment rules that are themselves subject to legal action.But campaigners were not satisfied. \u201cAt this stage, the bank still does not require its clients active in the oil and gas industry to immediately stop developing new fossil fuel projects and engage in a progressive exit from the sector,\u201d said Philippot. \u201cIt even underlines in its announcements its intention to bet on new gas infrastructures and power plants.\u201dIn a statement, BNP Paribas said it regretted that the NGOs had chosen to engage in litigation rather than dialogue.\u201cBNP Paribas, like other major international banks, is a longstanding financier of energy production. Approximately 10 years ago, 95% of our outstanding financing for energy production financed fossil energy projects. Today, already more than half of our financing for energy production is oriented towards low-carbon energies.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Indeed, it\u2019s been possible, on damp and squally, old-fashioned British July days (and provided you closed your ears and eyes to the unnerving news coming in from Rome and Xinjiang), to pretend that the climate crisis was no more than a fever dream. That\u2019s not been an option for southern European winemakers, of course, who have once again been battling with the brutal effects of extreme heat, which range from the dramatic (wildfires) to the quietly devastating (much-reduced crops and quality). Those winemakers know that some grape varieties cope better in a heatwave than others: the vermentino of central Italy and southern France, for example, has a remarkable ability to yield breezily fresh, gently floral, citrussy dry whites such as Ecclesa in the dazzle and blare of a Sardinian summer.Taste the Difference Garnacha, Campo de Borja, Spain 2021 (\u00a38, Sainsbury\u2019s) Vermentino\u2019s capacity to retain freshness and acidity will be sorely tested this year when the temperature across its traditional production zones has soared far above 40C at times. That it can thrive in the heat has made it an attractive choice for growers looking to plant in warm regions all over the world, with particularly successful examples emerging from Australia. The same is increasingly true of another white variety that has developed over centuries in hot, arid, windy conditions: the assyrtiko of the Greek island of Santorini, prized for an electric acidity and mouthwatering mineral quality that is more commonly found in northern European whites such as riesling and the chardonnay of Chablis, can now be found in South Australia, California, Lebanon, South Africa and the South of France \u2013 the sort of places where another sun-and-wind-loving variety, the red garnacha (aka grenache), makes abundantly, vividly berry-juicy reds such as Sainsbury\u2019s northern Spanish bargain.Real Companhia Velha Quinta das Carvalhas Tinto, Douro, Portugal 2018 (\u00a318.99, dbmwines.co.uk) With growing season temperatures having increased by an average of 2C over the past half century and set to jump another 2C in the next 50 years, growers all over the world are asking tough questions about whether and how long their existing grape varieties can cope with the changed circumstances. In the UK, there\u2019s been a certain amount of excitement about the newfound ability to ripen such varieties as Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. In a region such as Bordeaux, however, serious thought has been given to the long-term viability of their favoured merlot and cabernet sauvignon, which has led the French wine governing body to authorise the planting of a bunch of new heat-resistant varieties. Among them was the Portuguese touriga nacional, one of the key grapes of Port and the powerful red wines of the Douro Valley. Which raises the intriguing if \u2013 for lovers of the traditional, lighter, fresher Bordeaux style \u2013 heart-breaking possibility that such sumptuous, richly fruited reds as Quinta das Carvalhas might be the shape and taste of claret to come.Follow David Williams on Twitter @Daveydaibach",

The protests also spread to storage and packing facilities belonging to Amazon, where workers have recently demonstrated against allegedly poor working conditions, and the discount supermarket chain Aldi, in what were seen as expressions of broader feelings of discontent towards the government.Why Europe\u2019s farmers are protesting \u2013 and the far right is taking noteRead moreThe far-right populist Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland has been blamed for contributing to the angry mood. Its accusations towards the government of cronyism, embezzlement and war-mongering were reflected in many of the banners and speeches visible on Monday.A tractor decorated with dummies with images of (from left) the German chancellor Olaf Scholz, the economy minister Robert Habeck, and  foreign minister Annalena Baerbock.

Others held up the slogans: \u201cEmpty tanks \u2013 the game\u2019s over\u201d, \u201cWithout farmers there\u2019s no future\u201d, and \u201cTransport made in Germany \u2013 but for how much longer?\u201dAbout 1,300 police were in attendance.The agriculture minister, Cem \u00d6zdemir of the Greens, who has largely sided with the farmers, and blamed Lindner, of the pro-business Free Democratic party, for a poorly communicated policy switch, told German television before the rally: \u201cThe problem is not just the question of agricultural diesel. The problem is that no one spoke to them about it.\u201dHe said the protesters had finally achieved the feat of putting issues such as the pivotal role of farmers in the food supply chain at the top of the political agenda.Some protesters had arrived with vehicles piled high with manure that they planned to dump at the door of the Bundestag, the parliament building close to Brandenburg Gate. But they were dissuaded from doing so in last-minute negotiations between police and organisers.",

        "text": "Ecological collapse is likely to start sooner than previously believed, according to a new study that models how tipping points can amplify and accelerate one another.Based on these findings, the authors warn that more than a fifth of ecosystems worldwide, including the Amazon rainforest, are at risk of a catastrophic breakdown within a human lifetime.\u201cIt could happen very soon,\u201d said Prof Simon Willcock of Rothamsted Research, who co-led the study. \u201cWe could realistically be the last generation to see the Amazon.\u201dThe research, which was published on Thursday in Nature Sustainability, is likely to generate a heated debate. Compared with the long-established and conclusively proven link between fossil fuels and global heating, the science of tipping points and their interactions is relatively undeveloped.The United Nations\u2019 top science advisory body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has been more cautious. In its latest report, it said there was a chance of a tipping point in the Amazon by the year 2100.However, several prominent Brazil-based scientists, including Carlos Nobre, have warned that this may come much sooner. The new study underlines that alarming prospect. It observes that most studies until now have focused on one driver of destruction, such as climate change or deforestation. But when you combine this with other threats, such as water stress, degradation and river pollution from mining, the breakdown comes much quicker.Lake Erhai in China collapsed sooner than most observers expected. According to Willcock, this was because projections had been based on one factor \u2013 agricultural runoff that was loading the water system with excess nutrients \u2013 but other stresses compounded and accelerated this degradation. When climate variation, water management and other forms of pollution were added into the mix, the lake system quickly lost its resilience.Overall, the team, comprising scientists from Southampton, Sheffield and Bangor universities, as well as Rothamsted Research, looked at two lake ecosystems and two forests, using computer models with 70,000 adjustments of variables. They found that up to 15% of collapses occurred as a result of new stresses or extreme events, even while the primary stress was maintained at a constant level. The lesson they learned was that even if one part of an ecosystem is managed sustainably, new stresses such as global warming and extreme weather events could tip the balance towards a collapse.While the scope of the study was limited, the authors said the results showed the need for policymakers to act with more urgency.\u201cPrevious studies of ecological tipping points suggest significant social and economic costs from the second half of the 21st century onwards. Our findings suggest the potential for these costs to occur much sooner,\u201d the co-author Prof John Dearing noted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Although the study focused on the negative aspect of straws breaking the back of ecosystems, he said the opposite could also be true. Lake Erhai, for example, has shown signs of recovery.\u201cThe same logic can work in reverse. Potentially if you apply positive pressure, you can see rapid recovery,\u201d he said, though he emphasised time was running out faster than most people realised.",

She lives and works in mid-Wales where she rescues, keeps and paints owls.How did you feel in the days and weeks after George flew away?I had this huge bird-shaped hole in my life. I had my painting and my poetry, but my third marriage was crumbling and all the attention I had paid to George really had nowhere else to go. I also had this vast aviary I had built, so I set about determinedly trying to find occupants for it. You can go and buy a bird but that wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do. The birds had to be unwanted and they had to need care \u2013 birds that could not otherwise fly free. The first bird I took in was an elderly crow named Oscar, who couldn\u2019t fly. But he died after 46 days.Animals and nature generally are a constant reminder to me of what really mattersDescribing Oscar\u2019s death, you write: \u201cThe sense of emptiness and loss was so profound, so deep, it seeped through my veins like a sticky ink.\u201d Why do you think it hit you so hard?I felt that Oscar\u2019s death, coming when it did, linked me to all the other deaths and losses in my life: my mother\u2019s death, my father\u2019s death, my brother\u2019s death, my collapsing marriage, George\u2019s departure and all the other deaths. Somehow for the first time I felt the weight of them all. On top of that, when a creature needs you and is totally dependent on you and then, inevitably, it dies, the bereavement process is always really hard. Some days I felt I would never stop crying. I cannot help it, I do anthropomorphise: I kept thinking about Oscar\u2019s lack of family and how he might feel about dying in my house.You went straight out and bought yourself a motorbike. Did that help your state of mind?Oh, yes. I have loved motorbikes all my life, ever since I was 15. And it did help because it enabled me to get away and escape. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I absolutely love my home but it is full of work, and obligations, and things crying out to be done. To be able to go out on a motorbike is to be free. I don\u2019t need anybody else with me, all I need is a folder full of poetry, so I can go and sit in a cafe and write, completely unencumbered.One of Frieda Hughes\u2019s illustrations from George: A Magpie Memoir.What role do birds and animals play in your life now?I now have 13 owls, two rescue huskies, one royal python, six chinchillas and an ageing ferret called Socks. I live by myself in the middle of nowhere so they are my little feathered and four-footed family, really. One of the owls, Wyddfa, a male snowy owl with a damaged wing, lives in the kitchen and utility room and has his little places to perch. And I let the little ones out of the aviary for bit of time flying around inside during the day, too. So, they form the household. If you took them all away, it would be really cold and empty and still and silent. When you have all these little creatures to run around after, cleaning up, and feeding them, it gives a structure to your day. They\u2019re very grounding. The world can go mad, but they\u2019re very consistent. Animals and nature generally are a constant reminder to me of what really matters.Would you say that George changed your life?Well, he certainly kicked my life in a completely different direction. He and his magpie presence had a very powerful effect on me. He left me with a love of birds that I just hadn\u2019t expected. If you had told me, a few years before, you\u2019re going to fall in love with a magpie and be completely crackers about it, I would have laughed at you. If you\u2019d told me I was going to end up with 13 owls in an aviary, I wouldn\u2019t have believed you. I\u2019d looked after birds before but with George it was different because we really related to each other. We had such a connection. I never knew that having a magpie would be so much fun. It was like having a whole little person in the house but with wings \u2013 and a really mischievous brain.\nGeorge: A Magpie Memoir by Frieda Hughes is published by Profile Books on 27 April (\u00a316.99).

The project lies on the largest known undeveloped silver deposit in Australia, identified as one of three significant projects by the NSW Resources Regulator alongside the McPhillamys gold mine and Narrabri gas project.Silver has the highest electrical and thermal conductivity of any known material, making it an irreplaceable item in the production of crystalline solar panels, smartphones, medical appliances and household switches.Cadia goldmine: Newcrest pleads guilty to breaching clean air regulationsRead moreBut the extraction of silver relies on drawing out the precious metal from highly toxic lead, to which there is no safe level of human exposure.The neurosurgeon Dr Peter Bentivoglio told the inquiry that exposure to lead dust from mining can be \u201cdeleterious to human health\u201d.\u201cWe know chronic exposure to lead in children results in IQ levels drops of 10 to 15 points,\u201d he said in the hearing. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t know about the rest of you but I don\u2019t have 15 points to throw away,.A spokesperson for Bowdens Silver told Guardian Australia that the mining project presented no health risk to the community.\u201cComprehensive risk assessments were independently peer-reviewed and assessed by multiple government agencies including NSW Health, the Environment Protection Authority and the Department of Planning and Environment,\u201d they said.\u201cThese all showed the project presents no health risks to the local community and no agency raised objections to this conclusion.\u201dThe inquiry is looking into the current and potential impacts of gold, silver, lead and zinc mining on human health, land, air and water quality.Despite assurances, Bentivoglio told the hearing that he had his doubts.\u201cThe statement that says there\u2019s no health impacts as a result of the Bowdens lead mine, if it goes ahead, would have to be seriously tested.\u201dBentivoglio described a comprehensive air monitoring system and blood testing program, similar to those in Broken Hill and Mount Isa, where elevated lead levels have been found in children as young as two.\u201cThe cost should be borne completely by the mining companies,\u201d he told the inquiry. \u201c[Testing] will have to go for a long time with children because it\u2019s going to be all their life.\u201dMother of two Jade Miskle speaks at the NSW upper house inquiry on Wednesday.

The company could meet those targets by cutting emissions or buying carbon credits to offset its pollution.Opponents said the condition covered only a fraction of the total pollution expected from the extension as the vast bulk would be \u201cscope three\u201d emissions released after the gas was exported and burned overseas. \u2018Our ancestors are in the rocks\u2019: Australian gas project threatens ancient carvings \u2013 and emissions blowoutRead moreWoodside has estimated the development\u2019s scope three emissions would be about 80m tonnes a year. Climate campaigners said it suggested it could be responsible for more than 4bn tonnes of additional carbon dioxide over 50 years \u2013 more than eight times Australia\u2019s annual emissions.The head of clean transitions at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, Jess Panegyres, said the North West Shelf extension would undermine Australia\u2019s emissions reduction efforts and add to a worsening climate crisis if allowed to go ahead.She said the EPA recommendation could lead to Woodside tapping a long-promised new gas field, Browse, off the WA coast, and showed \u201chow fossil fuel companies can exploit our weak environmental laws in their own self-interest\u201d.\u201cBoth the UN and International Energy Agency have been very clear that there can be no new gas developments to limit global warming to 1.5C, but Woodside continues to aggressively expand its operations, even with the global gas market set to shrink as the world switches to cleaner, safer renewables,\u201d Panegyres said. \u201cThis dangerous company does not have Australia\u2019s economic or environmental best interests at heart.\u201dWoodside said the release of the EPA recommendations marked an important step in the North West Shelf extension. Its executive vice-president, Fiona Hick, said the company would carefully consider the conditions proposed by the EPA.\u201cAt a time of heightened concern around energy security, the North West Shelf project has an important role to play in delivering natural gas to local and international customers, providing energy that can support their decarbonisation commitments,\u201d she said.Woodside recently dramatically expanded its fossil fuel footprint by merging its petroleum assets with those of the global miner BHP, a step that made it one of the world\u2019s Top 10 oil and gas companies. It is proposing several new developments in Western Australia, including a $16bn development of the untapped Scarbrough gas field.It has been criticised for failing to explain how it would meet what it has described as its aspiration to reach net zero emissions by 2050. At an annual general meeting in May, 48.97% of shareholders voted against the company\u2019s climate report.Federal government emissions data shows the North West Shelf development emitted more than 6.7m tonnes of carbon dioxide in the 2020-21 calendar year, more than any other Australian industrial facility.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morningThe executive director of the Conservation Council of Western Australia, Maggie Wood, said the plant was one of the oldest and least efficient gas processing plants in the country, and the plant\u2019s extension could undermine efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050.She said it would continue Western Australia\u2019s role as the laggard state on climate. Its emissions have increased 20% since 2005, largely due to the rise of a large liquefied natural gas export industry.\u201cExtending the life of this giant fossil fuel facility is not going to reverse the trend that has made WA the worst performing state on climate action in the country. We not only can do better, we must do better,\u201d she said.The EPA\u2019s recommendations included additional conditions to prevent damage to Murujuga rock art on the Burrup Peninsula, some of which is believed to date back nearly 50,000 years. They included reducing emissions of nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds by at least 40% by 2030.The authority\u2019s report on the development is open for appeal until 21 July after which the state environment minister, Reece Whitby, will make a final decision.",

        "text": "The UK is lagging far behind France and other EU countries in installing heat pumps, research has shown, with less than a tenth of the number of installations despite having similar markets.Only 55,000 heat pumps were sold in the UK last year, compared with more than 620,000 in France. Twenty other European countries also had higher installation rates than the UK.Heat pumps, which are powered by electricity and work rather like fridges in reverse, are considered the most efficient way for the UK to shift to low-carbon heating and away from the gas-fired boilers that heat the majority of homes. With gas prices still at high levels, heat pumps are cheaper to run than gas boilers, though more expensive to install, and could be cheaper still with further changes to the electricity market.At current rates, the UK has little chance of meeting the government\u2019s target of 600,000 heat pump installations a year by 2028. However, according to analysts from the MCS Charitable Foundation, which approves low-carbon certification standards, gearing up to do so could create 50,000 new jobs, up from only about 2,000 jobs in the industry today.Heat pumps: more than 80% of households in Great Britain \u2018satisfied with system\u2019Read moreThe MCS report, titled Heat Pump Rollout in France and the UK 2023, called on the government to make heat pumps mandatory for all new homes, scale up and extend grants to install heat pumps in existing homes, introduce new loan schemes for homeowners, and embark on a countrywide awareness campaign to explain heat pumps and the incentives on offer.The existing boiler upgrade scheme must be extended to be effective, the report said, and ministers must bring in the long-awaited future homes standard from 2025, with a clear end-date for the sales of gas boilers.David Cowdrey, the director of external affairs at MCS, said: \u201cHeat pumps are an extremely efficient technology for cutting carbon and bills, but the UK has so far not capitalised on their potential. With other countries such as France surging ahead, the race is on for the UK to step up. We need a much more comprehensive set of policy measures to meet the government\u2019s targets.\u201dThe UK\u2019s market for heat pumps grew by about 40% in 2022, but from a very low base, with only 1.9 heat pumps installed for every 1,000 households last year, compared with 20 for every 1,000 households in France, and nearly 70 in Finland.MCS said it was not too late for the government to meet its targets, pointing to an 80% increase in France from 90,000 installations in 2018 to 175,0000 in 2019 after the introduction of a grant scheme available to all households.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company\u2019s representatives acknowledged the rather ungreen image of superyachts, admitting that the 300 biggest boats in the world cause as much emissions as 10 million people.\u201cWe have to realise at first that yacht-builders have a bad reputation in general in the area of all things sustainable,\u201d said Artur Poloczanski, the PR director of Sunreef.The emissions from yachts were \u201cscary\u201d, Poloczanski admitted, but \u201cit\u2019s fair to say the yachting environment is very diverse. We are here to discuss the alternatives.\u201dSeveral Sunreef yachts contain a solar \u201cskin\u201d that can generate power, stored by batteries. Some can run on hydrogen fuel cells, too. However, the company also sells extremely large vessels that contain private spas, gyms, outdoor cinemas and space for jetskis, powered by tanks holding up to 5,200 gallons of fuel.

        "text": "The dreadful scale of the loss of life on the Hawaiian island of Maui has emerged day by day, as search and rescue teams scour ash and rubble. But it is already clear that the wind-fuelled blaze which last week ripped through the historic town of Lahaina was the deadliest wildfire in the United States for more than 100 years.Hundreds are still missing, and the sheer intensity of the fire means that the identification of bodies and the notification of relatives will be a difficult and slow process. The west Maui town itself, the former capital of the Hawaiian kingdom, is a charred wasteland in which close to 3,000 structures were burned to the ground at terrifying speed.Along with the grim process of recovering the dead, finding viable accommodation for the survivors is the immediate priority. In the weeks ahead, tourists will hopefully heed pleas from the Hawaii Tourism Authority and stay away from the rest of the island. Hotel space and Airbnb accommodation will be needed for first responders and evacuees, not holidaymakers. Reconstruction will then be a laborious process costing many billions of dollars.Lessons will also need to be learned in the wake of the worst natural disaster in Hawaii\u2019s history. As climate-related disasters become more frequent, more unpredictable and intensively destructive, a step change is needed in how governments and societies respond to the threat. In this regard, state authorities in Hawaii appear to have been badly behind the curve. An emergency management plan, published by state officials last year, identified tsunamis, earthquakes and volcanic hazards as potentially deadly threats, but described the risk of wildfires to human life as \u201clow\u201d. That judgment now looks culpably complacent.Record-breaking temperatures in recent years, combined with forest loss and abandoned farmland featuring more combustible non-native grasses, had turned parts of Maui into a virtual tinderbox. A previous report stated that a 2018 brush fire, which forced residents to evacuate homes and burned more than 2,000 acres of land, should be a \u201creal world wake-up call\u201d. As was the case in last week\u2019s catastrophe, that blaze occurred in drought conditions, amid high winds from a hurricane traversing the Pacific Ocean. Yet when the worst came to pass in Lahaina, warning sirens failed to work and the island\u2019s firefighting force was ill\u2011equipped and overstretched.Hawaiian Electric, the utility which oversees electricity provision to the vast majority of Maui residents, also has questions to answer. The immediate cause of the fire is still under investigation. But in states such as California, where a catastrophic wildfire destroyed a mountain town in 2018, electricity is now cut off altogether to areas where wind risks triggering a conflagration. Hawaiian Electric has previously acknowledged the effectiveness of this precautionary approach. But it chose last week to keep power lines energised despite weather warnings, a decision which is now the subject of a class-action lawsuit.Global heating has inaugurated an era of climatic instability and volatility. Proactively analysing and preparing for worst-case scenarios means acting to anticipate disasters that may not happen, and persuading the public that such caution is worth the cost \u2013 both financially and in terms of disruption. The rest of the world, not just Hawaii, needs to wake up to this new and deeply challenging reality.",

Revenues at the company increased to \u00a3257.5m, up from \u00a3251.3m the previous year.Its profits were also hit by soaring operating costs, which jumped from \u00a3184m the previous year to \u00a3228m in the latest results.Its annual report said shareholders were paid dividends of \u00a39m for the last financial year, the same amount as the year before. That contrasts with the 2020-21 financial year, when such payouts totalled \u00a3147m, including a special restructuring dividend of \u00a3136m.The company said it had been unable to achieve its annual leakage targets for the first time in more than a decade, but added that it had implemented a recovery plan to \u201cmake up the ground\u201d.South East Water said: \u201cWhilst we acknowledge that the climate is changing, we have seen an exceptional combination of extreme weather events this year that has significantly impacted on our business operations and financial performance.\u201dLast month, the firm imposed the first UK hosepipe ban of the summer, blaming the move on more people working from home during the warmest June on record.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Freddy is forecast to inflict much more damage.Estimates suggest winds are reaching 140mph, comfortably within category 4 cyclone intensity, or Very Intense Tropical Cyclone status. Despite forecasts of a slight reduction in intensity over the coming days, by the time Freddy makes landfall in Madagascar, gusts are likely to be about 100mph, making it a category 2 cyclone. With destructive winds and significant rainfall of 100-200mm possible, there will also be a severe risk of deadly landslides.Freddy has had a long journey across the Indian Ocean over the past few weeks, having developed into a category 1 cyclone on 6 February, just south of Indonesia. Since then it has travelled almost 4,000 miles across the ocean over the past 14 days to where it is now, about 1,000 miles off the east coast of Madagascar.Only two other cyclones are known to have crossed the Indian Ocean: Eline and Hudah, both in 2000. Despite Freddy seeming like a significantly long-lasting cyclone that will have travelled the span of an ocean, it is a long way off from the farthest travelled and longest-lasting.In 1994, Hurricane John, also known as Typhoon John, tracked more than 7,000 miles in 31 days. The hurricane started off in the eastern Pacific and reached so far west that it was also considered a typhoon because it existed in the east and west basins of the Pacific Ocean.Once Freddy makes landfall, its interaction with the elevation of the land and reduction in a moisture source will make it weaken fairly quickly, with winds reducing to about 50mph by the time the cyclone clears the western side of Madagascar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Still, it was almost 80% higher than for the final three months of 2021.Household solar boom back on track after severe weather and supply disruptions lead to 14% drop in capacityRead moreRenewable energy from wind, solar and hydro supplied an average of 40.3% of power in the NEM, a record for any quarter since the NEM started in 1998.It exceeded the previous high, set a year earlier, of 35.8%, AEMO said.The tail end of the third La Ni\u00f1a event in as many years trimmed power demand for daytime air-conditioning.A 16% increase in electricity output from rooftop solar panels, or 410MW on average, also decreased demand from the grid.As a result, operational demand fell 2% from a year earlier to an average 19,431MW, the lowest December quarter reading. New record lows for a quarter were set in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales, while the 11,892MW use on 6 November was a new low for the NEM in the December quarter.The government hailed the early signs of a retreat in wholesale power prices as early proof that its price caps were having an effect on household bills. However, wholesale prices make up only about a third of retail costs and are subject to external events, such as an extended fault at coal-fired power plant, or heatwave-driven spikes in demand that could erase price falls.Wholesale costs may also have been lower due to a drop in gas prices from record highs in June and July. At an average of $17.79/gigajoule, though, the price remained two-thirds higher than a year earlier.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Plans were submitted by hundreds of cities across five continents for a new prize that aims to promote sustainable travel \u2013 and it seems the appetite for active transport has truly gone global.Ten months after cities around the world were offered the chance to bid for up to $1m (\u00a3800,000) to build or expand new cycling and walking schemes, the money has been awarded to designs in Brazil, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, New Zealand and Albania, among others.The money was put up by Bloomberg Philanthropies, the philanthropic arm of the media conglomerate set up by Michael Bloomberg, during whose terms as mayor of New York the city sprouted a rapidly expanding network of cycle lanes.Bids were assessed in conjunction with Global Designing Cities Initiative (GDCI), an urban design NGO founded by Janette Sadik-Khan, who was New York\u2019s traffic commissioner under Bloomberg.As well as the money \u2013 $1m for the winner and $400,000 apiece for the other nine cities \u2013 GDCI will help the cities with things such as design and local engagement.The top prize went to a plan to build more than 110 miles of protected cycle routes in Fortaleza, a city in Brazil\u2019s tropical north-east, with a focus on helping children and older people use bikes, and promoting cargo bike delivery.Fortaleza, in the north-east of Brazil, won the top prize for its plan to get more children and older people cycling. Photograph: Paulo WinzOther bike lane-focused winners included Ethiopia\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, which is aiming to build Africa\u2019s largest network of urban cycling routes; Mombasa in Kenya; the Albanian capital, Tirana; Pimpri-Chinchwad in Maharashtra state, western India; and Wellington, the capital of New Zealand.Quelimane, a major seaport in Mozambique, won funding for a plan that covers bike lanes and pedestrian spaces, but also proposals for parking and loading zones for the city\u2019s ubiquitous bicycle taxis, as a way to reduce congestion.Two of the winners are especially focused on active travel for school pupils. Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, aims to connect 20,000 students to schools with protected bike lanes, while Milan in Italy submitted a proposal to connect 40 schools with a radial network of bike routes.The plan for Bogot\u00e1 is specifically aimed at the mobility of children in a low-income part of the Colombian capital, based around a programme known as a ciempi\u00e9s, or centipedes \u2013 organised walking caravans that help students get to and from school safely.James Anderson leads the government innovation programme at Bloomberg Philanthropies. He said the prize received entries from 275 cities across 66 countries, arguing this was a sign of the global interest in active travel.\u201cDemand and interest in urban cycling is skyrocketing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe need to offer residents more sustainable mobility options is also urgent and critical. But we all know that city infrastructure has not kept pace.\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the level of innovation, we haven\u2019t seen the level of ambition that the moment demands.\u201dThe judges, he said, were not just looking for plans with coherent networks, but ideas that engaged with local communities, particularly ones seen as traditionally hard to reach for active travel schemes, such as Wellington\u2019s focus on the city\u2019s M\u0101ori population.\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition now in city halls everywhere that expertise comes from lots of places, and a lot of it comes from the community,\u201d he said.\u201cIf you want people in communities that have not typically participated in some of the sustainable mobility options, you need to go there and you need to work with them, need to get their thoughts on how to make cycling infrastructure useful in their day-to-day lives.\u201d",

He refused and on Wednesday, he said they informed him his contract had been terminated.\u201cIfW seems to ignore that we have entered the Anthropocene era and that the most important Earth ecosystems are close to collapse, if not already collapsed,\u201d Grimalda said.\u201cIn this era, wasting 4.5 tonnes of CO2 (the difference between the flight emissions and the slow-travel emissions) to comply with the absurd request to be physically present in Kiel at such short notice is morally unacceptable and epitomises the ultimate privilege of the global elites.\u201cIt is the sign that IfW is still living in an era that will be wiped out by the incoming climate collapses.\u201dWriting in the Guardian\u2019s opinion section on Thursday, Grimalda said the carbon that would be emitted by his one-way flight to Europe from Solomon Islands archipelago is more than the average person living there uses in an entire year.Grimalda said he intended to appeal against the IfW\u2019s decision to sack him, and said he had asked for the help of his trade union. But, he added: \u201cIn this case, the initial impression is that IfW actions are justified legally.\u201dA spokesperson for IfW said that it stood by its policy of not discussing or commenting on staff issues in public. \u201cIn general, the institute encourages and supports its staff to travel climate-friendly,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe are committed to do without air travel in Germany and in other EU countries as far as we can. When flights are unavoidable, we pay to Atmosfair to offset flight emissions through climate protection projects.\u201cWhat is public and obvious: Dr Grimalda planned his trip to Papua and his research stay with our support. We supported a second \u2018slow travel\u2019 trip of his before. So we have no general reservations about slow travelling.\u201d This article was amended on 13 October 2023. Bougainville is an autonomous island of Papua New Guinea in the Solomon Islands archipelago, but is not part of the country of Solomon Islands, as an earlier version implied.",

The larvae of the flies contain proteins and other nutritious compounds so are being raised for animal feed, and they break down waste so are being bred for that, too. However, adult flies are less useful and are discarded after their short life span. Wooley\u2019s team has been trying to use these carcasses to make useful materials from a waste product.The researchers found that chitin, a sugar-based polymer, is a major component of the flies and it strengthens the shell, or exoskeleton, of insects and crustaceans. Shrimp and crab shells are already used for chitin extraction. Researchers said the fly-sourced chitin powder seemed purer than that from crustaceans and obtaining chitin from flies could avoid concerns over some seafood allergies.From the fly products, the team created a hydrogel that can absorb 47 times its weight in water in just one minute. This product could be used in cropland soil to capture flood water and then slowly release moisture during droughts.Wooley said: \u201cHere in Texas, we\u2019re constantly either in a flood or drought situation, so I\u2019ve been trying to think of how we can make a superabsorbent hydrogel that could address this.\u201dThe scientists hope they will soon be able to create bioplastics such as polycarbonates or polyurethanes, which are traditionally made from petrochemicals, from the flies. These plastics will not contribute to the plastic pollution problem.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Workers in the UK\u2019s offshore oil, gas and renewables sector have called for public ownership of energy companies to ensure that the country\u2019s transition to net zero protects jobs, communities and the environment.The call comes amid a series of demands to government from a coalition of offshore workers, unions and climate campaigners that aim to shift the industry from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy sources.A survey of 1,092 offshore workers for the wide-ranging report, Our Power: Offshore Workers, found that 90% of respondents backed its demands, which also include: government-backed jobs guarantees; an offshore training passport that supports workers to retrain in the renewables sector; a commitment to incentivise investment in ports and factories making products such as wind turbines; and equal pay for migrant workers.Concerns are growing over the pace of Britain\u2019s transition away from fossil fuels and its ability to create green jobs in manufacturing, production and operations. Data from the consultancy PwC shows the number of jobs being created in the renewable energy industry is growing four times faster than the overall UK employment market. But more than one-third of these roles are based in London and the south-east, particularly in professional and scientific roles.The report argues that public ownership of energy firms would help to ensure a \u201cjust energy transition\u201d offering greater job security and conditions. It paints a picture of long stints at sea and low pay in the face of the cost of living crisis, with British workers paid three times as much as migrant staff.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has said that, if his party gains power, it will create a publicly owned energy company called Great British Energy to invest in clean UK power. Labour is yet to flesh out details of the plan.Julie*, who handles transport and accommodation for workers heading into the North Sea off Aberdeen, said: \u201cPublic ownership would mean decent contracts, permanent work, and that workers would be treated with respect. It\u2019s less of a danger to our working environment than having someone who is cowed, stressed or worried about their livelihoods.\u201dIn January, Chris Skidmore, head of the government\u2019s net zero review, said the government should consider replacing the windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas with a net-zero fund that ringfences the proceeds for investment in offshore wind and other low-CO2 projects.The workers\u2019 demands have been backed by the unions RMT, Unite Scotland and Unison Scotland and climate groups Platform, Uplift and Friends of the Earth Scotland. They also call for a windfall tax to be made permanent; strengthened grievance processes; and a sovereign wealth fund.Friends of the Earth Scotland\u2019s head of campaigns, Mary Church, said: \u201cFailure from politicians to properly plan and support the transition to renewables is leaving workers totally adrift on the whims of oil and gas companies, and the planet to burn.\u201dThe National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog, warned last week that ministers\u2019 efforts to tackle the energy bills crisis have left the UK at risk of missing a target to source all electricity generation from low-carbon sources by 2035.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This adds to growing evidence that the health harm from air pollution accumulates through our lifetime.The researchers concluded that current legal standards for air pollution are not sufficiently protective. Our health would be improved by further reducing air pollution, even when it met current standards. Additionally, people with lung conditions need extra protection from exposure.The health of 266,000 adults was tracked for an average of 12 years. These adults were all volunteers from England, Wales and Scotland who took part in the UK Biobank project.To date, most studies have looked at links between air pollution and single health outcomes; the first diagnosis of asthma for example, admissions to hospital or to death. In the new study researchers tracked people\u2019s heath lung health from being illness-free, to having long-term lung conditions and to early death.By the end of the study, 13,863 people developed either asthma, lung cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 1,055 then developed multiple lung illness.Fourteen per cent of the people who developed one chronic lung problem then went on to to die during the study, as did 31% of people who developed multiple lung diseases. The study also collected information on lifestyle, including smoking, obesity, occupation and income, so this could be allowed for in the analysis.The impacts were strongest for particle pollution, even though average concentrations near the volunteers\u2019 homes were close to the 2040 target for England and that proposed for the EU for 2030. This suggests that these do not give sufficient levels of protection.Similar patterns were seen for nitrogen dioxide but the method for working out the pollution that people breathed was more complex and less certain.Although the research focused on lung illnesses, 10,562 people in the study in died from other causes, about 4% of the total. This risk of death was also greater for people who had more air pollution in their home neighbourhood, consistent with the large body of research that shows air pollution also shortens lives and increases death rates from many diseases.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Those from lower income households had approximately twice the decline in lung function and three times the risk of COPD compared with those on higher income who had the same air pollution exposure. International studies have also shown that air pollution increases the chances of getting lung cancer and subsequent survival rate.Prof Stephen Holgate from the University of Southampton, who was not involved in the new studies, said: \u201cResearchers have shown that not only is particulate and nitrogen dioxide pollution causally associated with common lung diseases, but air pollution also drives the worsening of disease to premature death. At a time when National Health Service operates more like a national illness service, we need to better recognise the massive contribution that air pollution is making to poor lung-health and stronger actions that drive down exposures to toxic pollutant emissions.\u201d",

In a separate report published on Tuesday, Climate Action Tracker (CAT) raised its projections slightly for future warming above the estimates it made at a conference in Glasgow two years ago.Graphic\u201cTwo years after Glasgow, our report is virtually the same,\u201d said Claire Stockwell, an analyst at Climate Analytics and lead author of the CAT report. \u201cYou would think the extreme events around the world would be sparking action but governments appear oblivious, somehow thinking treading water will deal with the flood of impacts.\u201dAs carbon clogs the atmosphere, trapping sunlight and baking the planet, the climate is growing more hostile to human life. The growth in CO2 emissions had slowed substantially over the past decade, the Global Carbon Project found, but the amount emitted each year had continued to rise. It projected that total CO2 emissions in 2023 would reach a record high of 40.9 gigatons.If the world continued to emit CO2 at that rate, the international team of more than 120 scientists found, it would burn through the remaining carbon budget for a half-chance of keeping global heating to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial temperatures in just seven years. In 15 years, the scientists estimated, the budget for 1.7C would be gone too.00:02:34Cop28 president hits back after outcry over remarks on fossil fuels \u2013 video reportThe researchers reported big regional differences in emissions. They expected fossil fuel emissions to have risen this year in India and China, the biggest and third-biggest polluters, and to have fallen in the US and the EU, the two biggest historical polluters. The average of the rest of the world\u2019s emissions was expected to have fallen slightly too.GraphicEmissions from deforestation and other land-use changes were also projected to have fallen slightly, though not by enough for current levels of tree-planting to make up for it, the researchers found.For the first time, the scientists also teased out the growth in emissions from flights and ships abroad. The two together were expected to have grown 11.9%, driven by soaring emissions from aviation.Pierre Friedlingstein, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter\u2019s Global Systems Institute and lead author of the study, said: \u201cThe impacts of climate change are evident all around us but action to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels remains painfully slow.\u201cIt now looks inevitable that we will overshoot the 1.5C target of the Paris agreement, and leaders meeting at Cop28 will have to agree rapid cuts in fossil fuel emissions even to keep the 2C target alive.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Gascoyne-Cecil is a Conservative politician, once an MP and minister, and now sits in the Lords as a hereditary peer.Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, which was built by Gascoyne-Cecil\u2019s ancestor the 1st Earl of Salisbury in 1611, is one of the UK\u2019s biggest country homes. Some of its gardens are open to the paying public, and prices to visit start at \u00a38 for the day.View image in fullscreenRobert Gascoyne-Cecil, the seventh Marquess of Salisbury, opposed the application to register the area of land as a common. Photograph: Tim Scrivener/ShutterstockHowever, some land on the estate is now freely accessible after Hertfordshire county council granted a request to register it as common land. The area was determined to be common because it counts as \u201cwaste land of a manor\u201d and under the law this means the public has access rights. The land, which comprises a mixture of grass, shrub and trees, has now been added to the common-land register, and the public has the right to walk there.Although it is almost 4 miles (6km) from his home, Gascoyne-Cecil objected to the application.Frances Kerner, the OSS\u2019s commons re-registration officer, said: \u201cI am delighted that the land at Wildhill Road has been added to the register of common land and that the public will be able to enjoy its beauty.\u201cIronically, the marquess recently hosted Future Countryside, an important conference tasked with discussing the many challenges faced by people who live in, work in and visit the countryside. Disappointingly, the society was not invited to the conference, but we hope that any future events held by the organisation will include the society and others who champion access to our splendid countryside.\u201dIn 1969, the land was provisionally registered as common but, according to the OSS, following an objection that year, the provisional registration was cancelled. It then was too late to register the land under the Commons Registration Act 1965.However, the Commons Act 2006 reopened the opportunity to rescue lost commons. Under paragraph 4 of schedule 2 to the Commons Act 2006 the excluded land became eligible for re-registration. The application, made by the society, to register the land duly provided evidence that the excluded land is waste land of a manor, which means that it can be registered as common land. According to the OSS, waste land of a manor is land of poor quality, which the lord or lady of the manor could not cultivate, and under the law this has been counted as common land.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Rainforest conservation projects are not suitable for carbon offsetting and a different approach should be used to effectively protect critical ecosystems such as the Amazon and Congo basin, a report has concluded.New research by UC Berkeley Carbon Trading Project looking into rainforest carbon credits certified by Verra, which operates the world\u2019s leading carbon standard, found that the system is not fit for purpose.It generates highly inflated environmental impacts and some projects fail to provide safeguards for vulnerable forest communities, according to the report, making them unsuitable for companies to use for carbon offsetting claims as they are not equivalent to fossil fuel emissions.Halting the destruction of the world\u2019s rainforests is an urgent task for meeting UN climate and biodiversity targets, and supporters of carbon markets say they could direct billions to climate change and biodiversity mitigation if they work as intended.Through offsetting, companies and people say their own emissions have been cancelled out by paying for greenhouse gas removal or reductions elsewhere, often in developing countries.But a new assessment by a team of 14 UC Berkeley researchers, funded by the NGO Carbon Market Watch, found that the current system of generating rainforest protection carbon credits was not fit for purpose and was open to exploitation.The researchers assessed five quality factors of Verra\u2019s rainforest carbon credit system, known as Redd+ projects: their durability, forest carbon accounting, community safeguards, deforestation leakage and baselines, finding widespread shortcomings in all areas.Carbon credit speculators could lose billions as offsets deemed \u2018worthless\u2019Read moreThey found that the majority of credits did not represent a positive impact on the climate, that projects had routinely underplayed the risk of displacing deforestation elsewhere, and that auditors often failed to enforce Verra\u2019s own rules on generating credits. The report said some Redd+ projects had led to the displacement or dispossession of vulnerable communities, despite safeguards that were meant to prevent harm.\u201cOur research shows that the project type with the most credits on the voluntary carbon market, avoided deforestation, generates highly inflated credits that put forest communities at risk. An entirely different approach is needed to reduce deforestation and cut emissions,\u201d said Barbara Haya, the director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading project who led the report.The report recommended that governments and businesses should focus on curbing the drivers of deforestation around the world, support plans designed to help Indigenous communities conserve forests, and said companies should support a contributions approach to supporting rainforest conservation instead of buying offsets.In response, Verra said it welcomed the scrutiny of the scientific and environmental community on its work, saying that many of the issues highlighted in the report would be dealt with in the new methodology for generating carbon credits, which it will be publishing in the next few weeks. It has published a technical response to the study.\u201cWe are committed to transparency, and have built an ecosystem of processes and relationships to develop consensus standards and methodologies that support climate action,\u201d Verra said in a statement. \u201cIt is important to note that the vast majority of findings and recommendations from this research align with extensive and systematic work to update the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) Program that has been carried out by Verra over the last two years,\u201d it added.Earlier this year, the Guardian published an investigation that found that a vast numbers of rainforest carbon offsets were worthless. Several large companies have moved away from claims based on offsetting in recent months.\u201cThe research shows that the current rules governing Redd+ projects seriously lack credibility and cannot be trusted to generate high quality carbon credits. Businesses are offsetting their emissions on the cheap by buying low-quality carbon credits connected to forest protection projects in the Global South,\u201d said Inigo Wyburd, a policy expert on global carbon markets at Carbon Market Watch.Carbon Market Watch said it would be writing to Verra highlighting projects they thought were issuing illegitimate credits.\u201cBiodiversity, the climate and Indigenous people or local communities are losing out on what should have been a system to drive meaningful financial flows to the forest conservation projects that so desperately need it,\u201d said Gilles Dufrasne, policy lead on global carbon markets for CMW.\u201cOffsetting should be axed.

It has the potential to produce 500m barrels of oil and its final approval is expected to reach the energy secretary, Grant Shapps, in the next few weeks. It is expected to be approved after Rishi Sunak hinted last month that it would be \u201ceconomically illiterate\u201d not to invest in UK oil and gas because Britain will remain reliant on fossil fuels for \u201cthe next few decades\u201d.Reducing its potential emissions will play a major part in the approval process for Rosebank, with its main backer vowing to develop the \u201clowest possible carbon footprint\u201d for the project. The environmental statement drawn up by the project\u2019s backers suggests that they are exploring the option of sourcing clean energy from a forthcoming onshore windfarm in nearby Shetland.\u201cElectrification connected to the electrical grid on Shetland has the greatest potential for [greenhouse gas] reduction with the proposed windfarms on Shetland providing a low carbon source of energy via cable,\u201d it states.The Rosebank field is being developed by the Norwegian state-owned energy company Equinor, which is now under pressure from campaigners not to monopolise the energy produced by Shetland\u2019s new 103-turbine Viking windfarm, which is being completed.Construction of a section of the Viking windfarm on Riven Hill near Laxo on Shetland. Photograph: SJ Images/Alamy\u201cRosebank is oil for export and will do nothing to boost the UK\u2019s energy security,\u201d said Tessa Khan, executive director of the campaigning group Uplift. \u201cIf it also ends up taking vast amounts of cheap, clean energy that could be used to power hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses, it will end up actively reducing the UK\u2019s energy security. This would be laughable if it wasn\u2019t so serious.The project has already faced claims that without such electrification plans, the oilfield will blow a hole in the UK\u2019s carbon budgets that should come from oil and gas production, from 2028 onwards. In response, Equinor pointed to a statement from earlier in the year by the oil and gas regulator, the North Sea Transition Authority, in which it stated: \u201cNew oil and gas fields in the North Sea can absolutely be in keeping with the UK\u2019s commitment to net zero.\u201dThe conflict exposes the controversies that are being created as fossil fuel producers attempt to alter their plans in order to reduce their emissions. Rosebank is just one of several projects that are exploring the use of renewable power for their fossil fuel extraction operations. Last year, a group of North Sea operators met energy minister Graham Stuart and agreed to look at electrification.Three new oilfields \u2013 Clair South, Rosebank and Cambo \u2013 are exploring options for electrification. Analysts from Uplift found that the three would require up to 200-250MW of electricity to power their rigs, equating to at least three-quarters of the energy produced by the Viking windfarm \u2013 enough energy to power more than 450,000 UK homes.\u201cWe know that without electrification, Rosebank will bust the industry\u2019s already weak climate targets,\u201d said Khan. \u201cShetlanders and the UK public at large need to know that this option for decarbonising Rosebank is off the table, before and not after any decision is made on Rosebank.

Brown said this \u201cspeed-dating\u201d was important to ensure the genetic health of bat populations.Among the creatures that are found there are the rare serotine and barbastelle bats. The caves are also used for winter hibernation for some of the UK\u2019s rarest bats, such as the greater horseshoe.The land forms the eastern half of St Aldhem\u2019s Head, and will extend the existing trust-owned \u201cPurbeck Wares\u201d, an important habitat for orchids and other wildflowers. The coastal strip includes ancient \u201cstrip lynchet\u201d terraced field systems.Brown added: \u201cWe aim to create a landscape that is richer in nature, so there\u2019ll be no chemical inputs or regular ploughing on any of the land and life will be restored to the soil using natural regenerative farming methods. As the land is given time to rest and recover, the ground will store more carbon and streams flowing off the land will be cleaner and healthier.\u201dOver the coming years, the farm, which has been in the same family for more than 100 years and through three generations, is to be transformed into a mosaic of species-rich grasslands, wildflower meadows, scrub and woodlands.Conservation grazing of the grasslands sloping down to the coast should bring back plants such as the green-winged and early spider orchids.Restored meadows on the former arable fields will hopefully bloom with cowslips and knapweeds, and these flower-rich grasslands will become home to rare butterflies such as the Lulworth skipper and adonis blue. This will also open up nesting sites for endangered skylarks.Hedgerows, scrub and small woodland patches are intended to give refuge to voles and other mammals, and create breeding sites for birds including yellowhammers and linnets. This stretch of coastline is also the summer pit-stop for visiting birds such as whitethroats.As well as being good for bats, the trust says it will improve access for human visitors. Brown said: \u201cIn the future people will enjoy fantastic uninterrupted access along a 7km stretch of some of the UK\u2019s best coastline, and be free to explore some its most diverse and ecologically rich grasslands.\u201d",

        "text": "Last summer, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) delivered a 600-page assessment of the United Kingdom\u2019s journey towards net zero targets. The scathing conclusions could be summed up in a single sentence: Westminster continues to talk the talk, but a lack of follow-through means the country is failing to walk the walk.In too many areas, the CCC found, goals were being undermined by failures in delivery programmes. There was a \u201cshocking gap\u201d, it reported, in policymaking to drive better insulation of homes. Progress on reducing farming emissions had been \u201cglacial\u201d. The bald conclusion was that the \u201ccurrent strategy will not deliver net zero\u201d by 2050, as legally required.Given Rishi Sunak\u2019s failure to include the government\u2019s net zero strategy in his five key priorities for this year \u2013 and the prime minister\u2019s reluctance to turn up at the November Cop27 summit in Egypt \u2013 it is perhaps no surprise that the sense of drift continues. At the weekend, it emerged that cabinet ministers have been warned they risk court action over the failure to produce policies to meet binding targets. Civil servants at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \u2013 the worst laggard of all \u2013 are reportedly pleading with the current environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, to publish a viable decarbonisation plan for farms. The CCC has been calling for one since 2018; but successive ministers have shied away from radical change in a sector that is a traditional bastion of Conservative support.Across the board, the evidence is of inertia, short\u2011termism and a reluctance to use the state to drive a transition that is imperative for the environment and the economy. The future of Britain\u2019s electric car industry, for example, has been jeopardised by a failure to sufficiently incentivise leading battery manufacturers to build gigafactories in the UK.The absence of clarity and certainty in planning is startling. Last week, the National Audit Office criticised the absence of any long-term government strategy to meet its pledge to deliver low-carbon electricity by 2035. The government has failed properly to invest in a mass housing retrofit, and an aspiration that 600,000 heat pumps would be annually installed in households by 2028 has proved to be for the birds; last year the number was 50,000.On wind, the chief executive of ScottishPower, Keith Anderson, on Monday condemned the protracted planning process required to build offshore farms. Those now coming online, he pointed out in an interview, had originally been given the green light when Gordon Brown was in Downing Street. An effective ban on onshore wind is, absurdly, still largely in place after a recent public consultation. This despite huge public support \u2013 including among Conservative voters \u2013 for onshore farms and solar projects, in order to lower bills and speed the move away from fossil fuels.Meanwhile, the race to use the green economy to create new jobs and stimulate growth accelerates elsewhere. Across the Atlantic, President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has unleashed a gamechanging $369bn worth of federal subsidies and tax breaks to drive clean energy investment. In response, the EU is planning a new package of financial assistance and incentives. Yet, other than criticising Mr Biden over the IRA\u2019s \u201cprotectionism\u201d, Britain\u2019s new business and trade secretary, Kemi Badenoch, does nothing and sits on her hands.The high court has ruled that the government must clarify, by the end of this month, how its net zero strategy targets will in fact be met. A blizzard of figures and projections will no doubt be forthcoming. Given the track record, it will be hard to give them any credence. On climate policy, the government is demonstrably failing to make good on its promises to the world.",

        "text": "The world\u2019s largest grain trader, Cargill, is facing a first-ever legal challenge in the United States over its failure to remove deforestation and human rights abuses from its soya supply chain in Brazil.ClientEarth, an environmental law organisation, filed the formal complaint on Thursday, accusing Cargill of inadequate monitoring and a laggard response to the decline of the Amazon rainforest and other globally important biomes, such as the Cerrado savannah and the Atlantic Forest.The case, which was submitted under the guidelines of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, argues that Cargill\u2019s \u201cshoddy due diligence raises the risk that the meat sold in supermarkets across the world is raised on so-called \u2018dirty\u2019 soy\u201d. ClientEarth says this breaches the international code on responsible business conduct.The lawyers behind the complaint have stressed the urgency of the issue because Amazon degradation is approaching a tipping point, after which scientists say the rainforest will turn into dry grassland, emitting vast amounts of carbon dioxide. The Amazon\u2019s sister biome, the Cerrado, has already lost half of its tree cover.The lawyers say they hope the legal challenge will raise standards at Cargill \u2013 which is the biggest privately owned company in the US, with revenues last year of $165bn (\u00a3131bn) \u2013 and set an example across the industry.Laura Dowley, a lawyer at ClientEarth, said: \u201cCargill has vast resources at its disposal to implement due diligence. The technology is already there. We aren\u2019t asking it to do anything it doesn\u2019t have the resources to do. We hope it will show leadership.\u201dCargill has promised to be \u201cdeforestation-free\u201d in the Amazon and Cerrado by 2025 and completely eradicate deforestation from all its supply chains by 2030. The company says it has put in place a sophisticated monitoring operation at ports, warehouses and other points in its supply chain. ClientEarth said it identified several shortcomings in this system, including a lack of environmental due diligence on:\nSoya beans bought from third-party traders, which make up 42% of all Brazilian soya Cargill purchases.\nSoya beans owned by other companies that passes through Cargill ports.\nIndirect land use change.\nSoya sourced from the Cerrado savannah.\nSoya sourced from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.\nClientEarth also cites reports alleging Cargill suppliers have been involved in rights violations of Indigenous, Afro-Brazilian and other forest-dependent communities.Cargill told the Guardian it had not seen the full complaint but it had an \u201cunwavering commitment\u201d to eliminate deforestation and conversion in South America. In line with this, it added: \u201cWe do not source soy from farmers who clear land in protected areas and have controls in place to prevent non-compliant product from entering our supply chains. If we find any violations of our policies, we take immediate action in accordance with our grievance process.\u201dThe company\u2019s website notes: \u201cCargill is committed to transforming our agricultural supply chains to be free of deforestation by 2030. Our policy on forests lays out our overarching approach to achieving this target globally across our priority supply chains. It is founded on our belief that farming and forests can and must coexist.\u201d A spokesperson added that Cargill was also \u201cstrongly committed\u201d to protecting human rights in its operations, supply chains and communities.However, journalists revealed last year that one of Cargill\u2019s soya suppliers grows crops on land deforested and burned in the Brazilian biome. In 2020, the Guardian and partners uncovered evidence that Cargill supplied Tesco, Asda, McDonald\u2019s, Nando\u2019s and others with chicken fed on imported soya linked to thousands of forest fires and at least 300 sq miles (800 sq km) of tree clearance in the Cerrado savannah. Similar reports were broadcast this year by Sky News.",

There, I attended an on-a-shoestring riding school, which made my toy \u201ccarpet farm\u201d a reality. It was in Whitchurch-on-Thames, on the opposite bank of the River Thames to my childhood village, the other side of a magnificent, white-painted ironwork toll bridge that cost tuppence to cross on foot.With a deepening scent of autumn in the air, we begin along Hartslock Bridleway, part of the modern Thames path and the ancient Tuddingway packhorse route, heading to the inland ports of Wallingford, Goring and Crowmarsh. Much of the view is now blocked by an 8ft-high fence around Coombe Park estate.The path enters the wood on a cliff above the river. Either side are numerous shouty \u201cPrivate \u2013 Keep Out\u201d signs that have been scrawled over.

After a series of accidents, the council removed its rotting steps and handrail in 2011, without replacing them, rendering this part of a national trail unusable to everyone. Wet chalk makes for a treacherous surface. Thanks to a sustained campaign by Eric Hartley, a local access champion, the steps were replaced.

Photograph: Nicola ChesterWe climb Hartslock Hill in warm sunshine, above the wide Thames, ribboning between the rounded hills of the Goring Gap that separate the Berkshire Downs from the Chilterns. There seems a ruby glow behind the green of everything, intensified in pockets, and seemingly carried in the colours of the red kites (beech leaf, willow and sweet chestnut) and buzzards (oak tannin, sycamore).Descending to Old Reading cart track, the remembered freedom of Beech Wood is now a shoulder-width shuffle, flanked by a chestnut fence. Where it has collapsed, we walk, one behind the other, as if between the ribs of a wrecked ship.Then suddenly, there is the farm. Hidden now by 40-year-old conifers, it is the whaleback swell of the old barn roof I remember, and the hayloft, where we ate\u00a0our lunch above the ponies eating theirs. There is the old metal field gate, with its flattened curlicue scroll. With it all comes the feeling of mutual cosiness: of keeping in safe from storms. All the ponies I led through it come cantering back, nuzzling my pockets for sugar among sticky tuppences, for\u00a0the\u00a0toll\u00a0crossing back. Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",

The government is due to publish a new chemicals strategy this year that is expected to contain a system for dealing with long-lasting \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, but campaigners are also asking ministers to crack down on harmful mixtures.Of 1,006 river and lake sites with data, 814 were found to have these toxic mixtures, according to analysis of data collected by the government\u2019s Environment Agency.The data analysis, by Wildlife and Countryside Link and the Rivers Trust, found that more than half (54%) of the sites contained three or more of the five harmful chemical cocktails investigated, and up to 101 chemicals were identified in river samples.The rivers with the highest numbers of chemicals included the Mersey, Stour, Colne, Thames, Trent, Yare, Irwell, Medway, Humber and Avon.Six chemicals in five different mixtures were found across the sites, which included four toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d: PFOS, PFOA, PFBS and PFHxS. The pesticide 2,4-D and the commonly used painkiller ibuprofen were also identified.In laboratory conditions, these chemicals mixed together have been found to have disastrous impacts on water species including amphibians, fish, insects, nitrogen-fixing bacteria and algae.The adverse effects on these creatures included stunted growth, reduced cell function and lower survival rates. Some campaigners also fear they may have negative effects on human health but this has not been proved.Some sites contained all five chemical cocktails, including the Chelt in Cheltenham, the Derwent in Yorkshire, the Trent in Staffordshire, the Exe in Devon, the Ouse in East Sussex, the Wansbeck in Northumberland and the Yare in Norfolk.Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: \u201cA harmful chemical cocktail is being stirred up in UK rivers, putting wildlife and public health at risk.

The new chemicals strategy must make sure harmful substances are regulated not just for individual risks, but for their effects in combination.\u201dRob Collins, the director of policy and science at the Rivers Trust, said: \u201cWe need to stop pumping poison into our rivers. Hazardous chemicals are flowing into our waters, derived from every aspect of our lives. On the small-scale from the toiletries, food packaging, clothing and other goods we use individually, to large-scale industrial, medical and food production, we are creating an ever-growing chemical cocktail in our rivers.\u201cThe fact that these known toxic chemical combinations are found so widely across the country is deeply worrying.

This builds on work since the 2000s to increase monitoring and either ban or highly restrict a number of PFAS, both domestically and internationally.

It is available for hire for events including AGMs, awards ceremonies, conferences and screenings.In June, it emerged that the museum had decided that no further exhibitions or other activities would be sponsored by BP. It said there were \u201cno other contracts or agreements in effect between the museum and BP\u201d.The Tate, National Portrait Gallery, Royal Shakespeare Company, Scottish Ballet and Royal Opera House have ended funding partnerships with the energy firm in recent years.BP has been a sponsor of the British Museum since 1996.

Over-ripe stock was being sold by the bagful at the local market, which I turned into a celebration of tomatoes. Ideally, eat alfresco on a late summer\u2019s evening; I like to serve this with a spoon of aquafaba mayonnaise.Last of the summer tomato paellaThis simple dish is a brilliant, plant-based centrepiece. Paella is an original one-pot wonder, an epic platter of deliciousness, and I came up with this recipe to celebrate the last of the summer tomatoes while they\u2019re cheap, ripe and plentiful, and before they go out of season. Before you start cooking, prepare all the ingredients and have them ready to go; lay the table, too, so you\u2019re ready to eat. A paella takes only about 18 minutes to cook, and is best eaten fresh and without delay, not least so the rice doesn\u2019t overcook. Also, remember that the flavours will intensify as the stock is absorbed and reduces, so don\u2019t over-season the rice during the cooking.

Dong changed its name to \u00d8rsted in 2017 when it divested of fossil fuels to focus on renewables.By signing the contract, which was obtained by the investigative journalism organisation Point Source and shared with the Observer, the Natural History Museum agreed to refrain from making \u201cany statement\u201d that would \u201cdamage the reputation\u201d of the company.The company has sponsored the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition since 2016, and its current agreement runs until September 2023.One wall text at the 2016 exhibition stated: \u201cDrilling for oil is not generally considered beneficial for wildlife, yet oil rigs can provide shelter and a rich food supply for many animals including Brandt\u2019s cormorants.\u201dThe text was for an image titled \u201cRig Diver\u201d, taken by the British photographer Alex Mustard and showing a bird hunting fish beneath an offshore oil platform. The exhibition did not provide any context about the oil industry\u2019s negative environmental impact on marine ecosystems.In 2016 Dong operated an oil and gas business in the North Sea worth more than $1bn (\u00a3830m).Under the current contract, the Natural History Museum is not permitted to \u201cmake any statement or issue any publicity which may reasonably be foreseen as discrediting or damaging the reputation\u201d of the company.The use of the gagging clause has led to accusations of greenwashing by environmental groups and raised concerns about how large corporations can use sponsorship money to influence public discourse about environmental issues.The campaign group Fossil Free London is calling for all British museums and art institutions to stop signing contracts with large corporations that contain this kind of gagging clause. Robin Wells, a spokesperson, said: \u201cIt is totally unacceptable that, when the public walk through the doors of British museums, the information they consume is being controlled by large corporations.\u201dIn a statement, the Natural History Museum said it retains editorial control over all its exhibitions and denied the suggestion that sponsors have any influence over its content. \u201cClauses such as this are standard for corporate partnerships but, as they can be open to misinterpretation with regards to the absolute editorial control we retain, we no longer include them in new agreements.\u201dA spokesperson for \u00d8rsted said: \u201cWe would not seek to influence the Natural History Museum\u2019s views or limit its ability to provide its usual high standard of independent, critical, fact-based commentary on any aspect of the energy industry sector, should it choose to do so.\u201d This article was amended on 8 January 2023. A previous version inadvertently omitted details of \u00d8rsted\u2019s divestment from fossil fuels in 2017, and to state that the image \u201cRig Diver\u201d was exhibited in 2016; references to a \u201cgagging order\u201d in the text and headline were changed to \u201cgagging clause\u201d; and part of a statement from the Natural History Museum, clarifying that such clauses were no longer used in new contracts, was restored having been omitted owing to a production error.",

It then increased to 1.6% in 2021, but remained below the level seen almost a decade earlier..The report highlighted cuts to government support for green projects under Cameron, who was reported to have told aides in November 2013 to \u201cget rid of all the green crap\u201d from energy bills.At the time, his team said they did not recognise the phrase, but did not issue an explicit denial, and it came to symbolise the sea change from his previous claim to be leading \u201cthe greenest government ever\u201d.The government then went on to scrap or cut the funding for a wide range of green policies, including support for onshore wind, solar power subsidies and help for homeowners to bring down their energy bills by installing insulation.The report said the fall in green job opportunities \u201ccoincided with removal of funding for various supply-and-demand-side energy schemes from 2012-13 and the decline in broader climate policies during this period.\u201cWhile our analysis cannot attribute a causal link between these trends and policy developments, the decline in the earlier part of the sample period coincides with a decline in policy support for renewables and broader climate initiatives.\u201dIt said the more recent increase correlated with renewed government focus on green policies, including Theresa May\u2019s pledge to hit net zero carbon emissions by 2050, her industrial clean-growth strategy and Boris Johnson\u2019s 10-point green plan.Rishi Sunak is under pressure over his support for greening the economy, amid accusations that he lacks the commitment of his predecessor.

        "text": "There has been keen interest over recent weeks in the much-anticipated sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) event, which only began this week but is now well under way. The SSW phenomenon is linked to the polar vortex, an area of low pressure across the North Pole that forms within the stratosphere during autumn, as temperatures plummet in the absence of solar radiation.SSW events are very common and occur two in every three winters. It remains unclear how climate change will affect these events in the future. As the vortex develops during autumn and into winter, westerly stratospheric winds increase in strength. But in the event of a SSW episode, stratospheric temperatures rise rapidly in the space of only a few days, leading to the weakening or even reversal of these winds. The zonal mean winds at 10hPa pressure \u2013 about 30km high \u2013 turned to an easterly direction on 15 Wednesday February, significantly displacing the polar vortex away from the North Pole. The vortex and zonal winds are forecast to stay much weaker than normal for the remainder of February and into the first half of March.The consequences of this warming will spread slowly into the troposphere and can, over time, disrupt the jet stream that influences our weather on the surface. A weakened jet stream can help in the development of large \u201cblocking\u201d areas of high pressure. Should high pressure build across Scandinavia, it can feed very cold polar air from the east into western Europe and towards the UK. However, it is important to note that not all SSW events are the same, and not all will lead to cold conditions in Europe. The eventual effects of such SSW events are not usually experienced until two to three weeks after they begin.Meanwhile, intense heat affected large parts of Argentina during the first half of February, in what was the country\u2019s eighth heatwave this summer. This followed the warmest November to January period since 1961, with the National Meteorological Service of Argentina reporting that average temperatures were 1.7C higher than normal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "A figure in green walks towards the summit of Mount Everest. There\u2019s the elemental clamour of winds buffeting a range stretching across 1,500 miles and five countries. Snow spins lightly. Clouds roll like giant tumbleweeds over the peaks. \u201cThis is the most fantastic day of my life. Over,\u201d the figure announces breathlessly as she approaches the top of the world.This is how Chris Terrill\u2019s haunting feature-length documentary The Last Mountain (BBC Two) opens. We see archive footage of the moment on 13 May 1995, when Alison Hargreaves became the first woman to reach the top of the 8,849m (29,031ft) mountain without bottled oxygen or Sherpas carrying her gear. However you feel about the brief, vexed history of the human (mostly male, western, white) obsession with conquering the world\u2019s apexes, it\u2019s astonishing to witness. I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about The Last Mountain since I watched it. Or Googling the Mummery Spur on Nanga Parbat, also known as Killer Mountain. But I\u2019ll come back to that.Three months later, Hargreaves did it again, reaching the summit of K2 on 13 August. It was to be her final ascent. Hours later, she and five others died when they were engulfed by a storm. She was 33 years old. Back home in Fort William, her husband, Jim Ballard, had to tell their children, then four and six. Jim recalls 25 years later that Kate \u201ccried and shouted\u201d, and Tom asked if he could go and see \u201cMum\u2019s last mountain\u201d. Unbelievably they did, and Terrill went with them. Their grief-stricken expedition to K2\u2019s base camp formed the backbone of Terrill\u2019s first documentary about this extraordinary family of adventurers. Footage from it, such as the heartbreaking moment when Tom sees a wisp of cloud caressing K2\u2019s tip and asks his dad \u201cis that Mummy?\u201d, reappears here.Except this time the subject is the life and death of that very boy, Tom Ballard, who became a climber as gifted and committed as his mother and died at almost the same age as she did on a mountain, Nanga Parbat, 100 miles from where her body lies forever encased in ice. His body was never recovered either. So there are two documentaries embedded in Terrill\u2019s beautiful film, two journeys, and two last mountains.Parents: Alison Hargreaves, unfit mother?Read moreSix months later, Terrill films Kate, also a climber, as she makes another trip to Pakistan, this time to pay her respects to her brother. To walk where Tom walked, see what he saw, and be close to where he died. In one of the most moving moments, she is reunited en route with \u201cBig Ibrahim\u201d, the porter who carried her on his back 25 years ago and will now accompany her to Nanga Parbat\u2019s base camp. As soon as they see each other they burst into tears. So did I.The film is intimate but never heavy-handed. We are permitted to see the moment when Jim takes the call from Kate telling him a rescue helicopter has spotted the bodies of Tom and his climbing partner, Daniele Nardi. Nardi, we learn, was obsessed with reaching the summit via a never-completed route plagued by serac (falling blocks of glacial ice) and up to five avalanches a day in winter, known as the Mummery Spur. It\u2019s sensitively suggested that Nardi may have got inside Tom\u2019s head because attempting a climb this treacherous was out of character for him. \u201cIt\u2019s best not to go to that place,\u201d says veteran mountaineer Reinhold Messner, whose brother died on the Mummery Spur in 1970. \u201cBut everyone has the right to choose where they kill themselves.\u201dThere are as many ways to tell this story as there are routes up a mountain. Terrill doesn\u2019t touch on the media frenzy that followed Hargreaves\u2019 death when she instantly went from national hero to reckless mother who chose to abandon her children: a backlash no male mountaineer ever had to endure. He doesn\u2019t explore the grim commercialisation of Everest, or the colonial history. This is a film about climbers, and the best footage is of Tom Ballard doing what he did best. Thriving in conditions that would break most of us in moments. \u201cWhen I\u2019m climbing I become a part of the mountain and it becomes a part of me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a moving rock or piece of ice.\u201d The Last Mountain has a purity and simplicity that is somehow in keeping with the philosophy of its subjects. It\u2019s a film about the inarticulacy of grief and the magnetic pull of the mountains. This article was amended on 27 September 2021 to remove a reference to Alison Hargreaves being \u201cthe second climber in history\u201d to reach the Everest summit without bottled oxygen or Sherpas.",

It was the first time they had ever been mentioned in the text of a Cop agreement \u2013 officially recognising the taproot of a human-led climate emergency. Two years is a long time in geopolitics. This year\u2019s Cop28, which begins on Thursday in Dubai, will be presided over by Sultan Al Jaber, the chief executive of the state oil company of the United Arab Emirates, which has the largest net-zero-busting expansion plans of any fossil fuel business in the world.It was already doubtful that Mr Al Jaber was fit to lead global climate negotiations while responsible for planet-wrecking activities. This week\u2019s revelations that he planned to lobby on oil and gas deals during meetings with foreign governments ahead of Cop28 further damage his credibility as an honest broker in climate negotiations. Mr Al Jaber had a hard enough job without hustles making a mockery of his\u00a0independence.Despite running the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Mr Al Jaber\u2019s appointment as Cop28\u2019s president-designate was welcomed by the US and the EU, and backed by the G77 bloc of developing countries. Fossil fuel lobbyists have campaigned to torpedo the global climate agenda. There is something to be said for forcing them into the open to account for their actions rather than letting them operate in the shadows.The world is not doing enough to prevent global temperatures increasing beyond the \u201csafety\u201d threshold of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. At last year\u2019s climate summit, nations agreed to reduce \u201cinefficient fossil fuel subsidies\u201d. But such state handouts worldwide reached a record high of $1.7tn in 2022, emphasising the conflict between Mr Al Jaber\u2019s day job and his role at Cop28.In Dubai, there needs to be a shared zeal for achieving current climate targets, if not producing new, better ones. Mr Al Jaber must also seek agreement over further carbon cuts, payments for damage caused by global heating, and a fairer system of climate finance for poor nations, the majority of which comes as punitive high-cost loans.Bridging differences will be tricky. Developed countries want Cop28\u2019s focus to be phasing out \u201cunabated\u201d fossil fuels \u2013 eliminating dirty power that cannot be equipped with carbon dioxide removal technologies, the effectiveness of which is disputed. Many poor nations argue, justifiably, that to rely on unproven, expensive solutions is not only risky but also unjust.Had the developed countries achieved the targets set under the Kyoto protocol, developing nations say they could have taken up their \u201cfair share\u201d of greenhouse gas emissions while transitioning away from fossil fuels. Instead, five rich countries \u2013 the US, Canada, Australia, Norway and the UK \u2013 will contribute the majority of planned expansion of new oil and gas fields through to 2050.Cop28 is a critical moment of danger \u2013 and opportunity. It could provide a much-needed reality check and a push to upgrade the scale, and the urgency, of the actions required to keep climate goals within reach. Mr Al Jaber needs a quid pro quo, where the global south agrees not to stall \u2013 or sink \u2013 talks if the global north is held accountable for its fossil fuel-driven growth. Whether Cop28 is successful, or fails, is crucial for the planet. Its fate depends partly on Mr Al Jaber, who must know that a favourable result would be bad news for the industry he represents. Unfortunately his behaviour so far inspires more trepidation than hope.",

While the FCNSW initially asked the EPA for extra site-specific conditions it then began implementing its own measures a year later.\u201cUnlike the [specific conditions], the EPA was unable to undertake enforcement activities for breaches of voluntary measures,\u201d the report said.Greens\u2019 environment spokesperson Sue Higginson said: \u201cNative forest logging costs NSW tens of millions [of dollars] just in the harvesting and haulage.\u201cIf we add the expenses of the EPA having to monitor all of the non-compliant operations, then the bill blows out even more.\u201dCarmen Dwyer, an EPA executive director, said her agency had already implemented two of the report\u2019s recommendations.\u201cStrong and effective regulation is critical to ensuring our state forests are protected for future generations,\u201d Dwyer said.\u201cBy December this year, we will have documented and explained our approach to risk assessments in the Western Integrated Forestry Operations approval areas.\u201dEnd of native logging in Victoria \u2018a monumental win for forests\u2019, say conservationistsRead moreForestry Corporation said it accepted the audit office\u2019s recommendations and \u201cwas committed to making continued improvements to our operations where necessary.\u201cOur staff care passionately about the forests they work in and, over the last three years, we have significantly increased our efforts around compliance,\u201d a spokeswoman said, adding that included \u201cinvestment in technology solutions, putting more staff on the ground and a regular program of internal audits\u201d.",

        "text": "Rishi Sunak has come under fierce attack from UK climate experts for the Conservative government\u2019s failure over the past 18 months to appoint a new chair of the independent committee that advises ministers on emissions targets.In a letter to the prime minister leaked to the Observer, the UK\u2019s leading organisation working on the economic effects of global warming condemned the \u201cexcessive delay\u201d in finding a replacement to the previous chair, Lord Deben.Bob Ward, the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change\u2019s head of policy, warned Sunak that the delay is harming efforts to control carbon emissions and damaging the UK\u2019s reputation as a climate change leader.\u201cGiven that the recruitment of the new chair began 18 months ago it is inexplicable that the appointment has still not been announced,\u201d wrote Ward. The work of the committee is at a \u201ccritical stage\u201d, he added. \u201cIt is not helpful that it does not yet have a new chair as it carries out this work.\u201dThe economist Lord Stern, who is chair of the institute, said: \u201cIt seems to be yet another signal that the government does not take climate change policy seriously enough. All this is damaging the confidence of other countries and of investors in the UK\u2019s commitment to climate action.\u201dThe failure to find a new committee chair is the latest example of a lack of consistency displayed by Sunak towards his party\u2019s green commitments. This year, he dismayed environmentalists when he announced legislation for an annual system of oil and gas licensing in the North Sea which followed a scaling back of other measures including delays to a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.The Climate Change Committee is a body of experts set up under the 2008 Climate Change Act to guide national policies for controlling emissions and for helping the country prepare for the impact of global warming. In the past, it has been highly critical of Britain\u2019s poor performance in areas including the nation\u2019s flood defences and domestic energy efficiency.In July 2022, it was announced that Lord Deben \u2013 who was due to stand down \u2013 would continue in the post for an extra nine months while a new chair was sought. A year and a half later, the post is still vacant with Prof Piers Forster acting as interim head.Ed Miliband, shadow secretary of state for climate change, said it was critical that the UK became a clean energy superpower in order to cut power bills for families and to make the nation energy independent.\u201cThis is yet another sign that the Conservatives have given up in the fight for lower bills, energy independence and climate leadership,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cRishi Sunak should end the delay and make this crucial appointment as soon as possible.\u201dA key role of the committee is to set out the future amounts of greenhouse gases the UK can emit. The next carbon budget \u2013 the UK\u2019s seventh \u2013 will delineate how much can be emitted for the period 2038 to 2042.\u201cThe budget must be agreed by the first half of 2025 and be built on robust analysis and rigorous involvement by the committee,\u201d added Ward. \u201cThe fact it will still not have a chairman in place by 2024 to direct this work is deeply concerning.\u201dLord Deben agreed that a replacement was needed as soon as possible. \u201cIt is very important that a successor be appointed because they have to start work on the seventh carbon budget. That takes a couple of years.\u201dGovernment sources said the new chair needed to be approved not only by ministers in London, but also by the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, and the devolved government in Northern Ireland. This process is understood not yet to be complete.One of the front runners for the job is said to be former Tory minister and president of the Resolution Foundation think tank David Willetts.A government spokesperson said it remained committed to existing climate change targets and is on track to meet net zero in 2050.

Photograph: James Dobson/National Trust ImagesThe installation of the pipework involved drilling 32 vertical boreholes in an overflow car park, with each hole 180 metres deep.Specialists spent two years conducting extensive archaeological and ecological surveys to ensure the protection of the historic parkland, which includes iron age hillforts, heathland and water meadows.As well as saving approximately 57 tonnes of carbon a year, the new heating system will remove the danger of oil spills from the previous boilers and storage tank.The trust also says the heat pump will improve conservation of the building and its collection by stabilising the temperature and humidity levels.Known as the \u201cpalace of art\u201d, the house has an extravagant Spanish Room that the estate\u2019s 19th-century creator, William John Bankes, designed from exile after he was forced out of Britain because of his gay relationship with a soldier, and his collection of ancient Egyptian artefacts, the largest private collection in the UK.Owen Griffith, the lead renewable heat project manager for the National Trust, said: \u201cEven in the most historically significant settings like Kingston Lacy, it\u2019s possible to integrate these modern technologies.\u201cNot only will the heat pump reduce the property\u2019s dependency on fossil fuels, but it\u2019ll create a safer environment and improve conditions for the collection items here.\u201cMagnificent buildings like these have been around for centuries, but their heating systems have evolved \u2013 from open fires to coal boilers and then oil boilers, with many energy innovations along the way. This is simply the next step in Kingston Lacy\u2019s history and preservation.\u201dGriffith added: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found when we\u2019ve moved from fossil fuel conservation heating to heat pump conservation heating is that extending the heating time means that we have a longer duration of lower-grade heat coming into the building so it\u2019s a lot gentler. We\u2019re able to stabilise the internal environment over a longer period so daytime/night-time fluctuations, for example, are balanced out.\u201cYou don\u2019t get the spikes in heat from that you get from fossil fuels. It means we have a more stable environment that reduces the likelihood of mould growth and insect infestation.\u201d",

Many studies have shown that urban greenery levels reflect socioeconomic inequality, with people on low incomes less likely to live within a five-minute walk of green space or to live on green streets.The thinktank is also calling on the prime minister to declare a national mission to regreen all Britain\u2019s towns and cities, including a national competition to celebrate the best examples, support for commemorative tree schemes, and spreading resources and guidance on greening.Create Streets conducted a cost-benefit analysis into building small new parks in an urban area, finding a positive impact valued at \u00a36,495 per person living within 500 metres of the green space. This includes a combination of lower depression (\u00a3750), higher cognitive development (\u00a3150), reduced mortality (\u00a32,999), reduced crime and a higher house price (\u00a33,375).The report authors say there is an \u201cunconscious bias\u201d against greenery and plants in local planning, despite the benefits to areas and people. It says the government should encourage local authorities to adopt a \u201cgrow don\u2019t mow\u201d policy to create biodiverse verges instead of clearcut lawns.One approach praised by Create Streets is called \u201cthe 3-30-300 rule\u201d: that everyone should have sight of three trees, every neighbourhood should have 30% canopy cover, and everyone should live within 300 metres of a park or green space.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But we see no woodworker. We continue cautiously and the sound becomes louder and more complex. It\u2019s only when we emerge at the shore that we understand it is the lough itself speaking.

        "text": "Postponing action and taking a slower route to net zero emissions by 2050 will worsen the climate crisis even if the goal is still reached by that date, the new chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned.Prof Jim Skea also said that approving new oil and gas fields only increased the already large amount of reserves that will have to be kept in the ground if global heating limits are to be reached.The IPCC is the world\u2019s foremost authority on climate change, under which thousands of the world\u2019s best experts give advice to the 195 nations that founded the body. It does not comment on the climate policies of individual nations, but Skea\u2019s comments on Monday clearly indicate that the recent actions of the UK government has slowed climate action, despite IPCC scientists warning of \u201ca rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all\u201d.Rishi Sunak weakened or abolished a number of green measures recently, including pushing back a ban on the sale of new petrol cars from 2030 to 2035. The UK also approved the exploitation of the large Rosebank oil field near Shetland on Wednesday.Asked about these changes, Skea said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on individual country\u2019s policies, but, obviously, the more [oil and gas] you add to the reserves, the greater the percentage you would need to leave in the ground to stay within carbon budgets.\u201d\u2018He is making the UK a climate villain\u2019: MEPs denounce Sunak\u2019s net zero retreatRead more\u201cThe conclusion [of the IPCC\u2019s 2022 report] was that to limit warming to 2C [above pre-industrial levels], 30% of oil, 50% of gas reserves and 80% of current coal reserves would need to remain in the ground,\u201d he said. To keep below 1.5C and avoid the worst climate impacts, 60% of oil and gas and 90% of coal reserves need to remain unburned, according to a 2021 report.Postponing climate action leads to bigger increases in global temperature rise, Skea said: \u201cWhat determines global warming is not the timing of net zero, but the pathway by which you get there. It is the cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide over time that are the main factor.\u201cThe longer you put off action, the greater will be the cumulative CO2 emissions that have gone into the atmosphere, and therefore the higher the level of the warming. That\u2019s the global point.\u201d\u201cEvery fraction of a degree matters\u201d, Skea said, emphasising both \u201curgency and agency\u201d in terms of climate action. \u201cThe situation we are in is urgent, we are in dire circumstances. But we can also do something about it if we choose to do so.\u201dSunak\u2019s decisions were widely criticised by businesses that need stable policies in order to invest in green technologies, scientists and campaign groups.The prime minister said the changes would save households money, but this has been rejected by scientists and consumer groups. Prof Joeri Rogelj, director of research at the Grantham Institute for climate change at Imperial College London, said on Friday that the \u201cabrupt rollback\u201d was \u201cthe opposite of visionary [and] looks set to disappoint citizens, businesses and the world\u201d.Analysis from Carbon Brief concluded that Sunak\u2019s actions \u201cwill undoubtedly throw the UK even further off course from its legally binding emissions targets\u201d and some changes, such as scrapping minimum energy efficiency standards in privately rented properties, \u201cwill cost consumers billions\u201d in higher energy bills.The IPCC is beginning its new six-year cycle of reports, which will include a special report on cities and the climate crisis. Skea said it would also seek to address gaps in understanding of the impacts of overshooting the 1.5C and then reducing global temperature by removing CO2 from the atmosphere. How this would affect the losses and damage suffered by populations will be examined, as will the consequences on the natural world.",

They are believed to have come from shipping containers lost in the Atlantic Ocean.On France\u2019s north-west coast, dozens of volunteers turned up at the weekend to sift through sand at Pornic in the department of Loire-Atlantique to collect some of the beads, formally called industrial plastic granules (IPG), measuring less than 1.5mm. Environmental activists admit it is a hopeless task.\u201cIt\u2019s more symbolic than anything else: I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to pick up the whole container,\u201d said Annick, a retiree who had filled the bottom of a yoghurt pot with a few dozen pellets.Another local, Dominique, who had turned out to help, said: \u201cI wanted to pick them up but it\u2019s endless.

Photograph: Lo\u00efc Venance/AFP/Getty ImagesLionel Cheylus, a spokesperson for the Surfrider Foundation Europe, the campaign group that organised the clean-up operation, said: \u201cThese pellets are often lost [off the French coast] but I\u2019ve never known it this bad.\u201d Surfrider estimates that every year about 160,000 tonnes of the beads are lost in the EU and 230,000 tonnes are lost worldwide.Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Grandsart, of Surfrider, said: \u201cThe beads are so small that we can\u2019t do anything about them. We can try to clean them up by hand, but it\u2019s just a drop in the ocean.\u201d He said the plastic would break down into nanoparticles and be ingested by fish, oysters and mussels, eventually ending up on people\u2019s plates.Jean-Michel Brard, the mayor of Pornic, said he had filed a legal complaint along with two other politicians in the area \u2013 Yannick Moreau, mayor of another beachside town, Les Sables-d\u2019Olonne, and the president of the Pays de la Loire region, Christelle Moran\u00e7ais.

He told investors at the New York stock exchange that he wanted to \u201creward our shareholders today and far into the future\u201d. While saying he wanted to lower emissions, he also repeatedly emphasised his belief that oil and gas would be required for the long term.In its strategy in 2021, Shell said it would aim for \u201can expected gradual reduction in oil production of around 1-2% each year, including divestments and natural decline\u201d.However, Shell argued on Wednesday that the previous strategy did not constitute a commitment to cutting oil production steadily.It said it had in fact hit the target within seven months of announcing it because of the $9.5bn sale later in 2021 of its interest in al project in the Permian Basin, Texas. Shell\u2019s output was 1.9m barrels of oil a day in 2019, and dropped to 1.5mls a day \u2013 a 21% decline.A Shell spokesperson: \u201cOur target of a reduction in oil production by 2030 has not changed. We\u2019ve just met it eight years early.\u201dShell\u2019s announcement came on the same day that the International Energy Agency, a respected global energy watchdog, said the peak for global demand for oil would come before the end of the decade. In 2021, the agency said development of new oil and gas fields had to stop immediately to meet the goal of global net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and avoid climate breakdown.Climate campaigners criticised Shell\u2019s renewed commitment to fossil fuels. Carla Denyer, the co-leader of the UK Green party, said: \u201cFor Shell to target more fossil fuel production and to increase payouts to shareholders is pure climate vandalism, and a sign that fossil fuel companies will not steer us to the greener future we all crave without political leadership from national governments.\u201dSawan announced a strategy update in New York in which Shell would focus on cutting costs and targeting its most profitable areas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They told the Guardian they went from vehicle to vehicle drilling holes in the sidewalls of all four tyres on each, so they must be replaced.The Tyre Extinguishers claimed responsibility for the sabotage in online posts several hours later, saying that an independent cell had carried out the attack in their name. A grainy video showed at least one person on the forecourt of the dealership. The sound of a power drill could be heard as they crouched beside vehicles.The attack was a significant escalation in tactics for the campaign, whose supporters have previously limited themselves to letting the air out of tyres by jamming lentils in the tyre valves. Thousands of vehicles in upmarket districts of cities around the world have been targeted since the campaign began last spring.In an email circulated on Monday morning, the Tyre Extinguishers said the attack was in response to an incident in which a Land Rover crashed through a school fence into an end-of-year tea party at the Study Prep school in Wimbledon, south-west London, killing eight-year-olds Selena Lau and Nuria Sajjad, and injuring 16 others.\u201cThis act of retaliation is intended as a peaceful and non-violent demonstration to draw attention to the presence of grossly inappropriate private vehicles in our towns and cities,\u201d the Tyre Extinguishers said in a statement.\u201cTyre Extinguishers firmly believes that their action is a necessary escalation to try and stop these vehicles from wrecking further lives and continuing to push the worsening climate crisis off the cliff edge.\u201dIn light of the escalation of tactics, the statement added: \u201cWe are not responsible for individual actions, but simply publicise them.\u201dAnswering the Guardian\u2019s questions by email, an activist responsible for the action said studies had shown SUVs were eight times more likely to kill a child in a crash. \u201cThe deaths of the two young girls, in the safety of their school grounds, needed an escalation in action,\u201d the activist, going by the pseudonym Climate Protector, said.The activist confirmed all the vehicles targeted had been SUVs, and that they had drilled holes through the side walls of all four tyres on each vehicle targeted. \u201cWe would love to see others take up similar actions,\u201d they said.A spokesperson for Vertu Motors said: \u201cTrespass and damage to private property are not acceptable.

Similarly, the New England zone will now start in 2029 compared with an initial 2027 goal.Labor warns NSW facing a \u2018momentous task\u2019 in transition to renewables Read moreThe two zones account for the bulk of the new generation capacity laid out in the renewable energy roadmap, drawn up by the previous Coalition government.The central-west Orana area covers almost 21,000 square km, with the new network able to accommodate 4.5 gigawatts of capacity for new wind and solar farms at a cost of $3.2bn. The New England zone, covering almost 15,500 square km, will provide an initial network capacity of 2.4GW and cost $4.2bn.Initial costings in 2020 had put the cost of $400m-$800m for the central-west Orana alone, Sharpe said, adding \u201cthere was not a lot of information\u201d about the network details before she took over the portfolio.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\u201cThis is the detailed work for the first time that\u2019s been done, rather than what I would call a bit of a \u2018back of the envelope\u2019 and a bit of guessing that went on in 2020,\u201d she said.The delays add to other hurdles in the race to build sufficient new generation capacity and storage in NSW and others states to replace coal-fired power stations as they close. This month Snowy Hydro admitted its giant pumped hydro plant would be delayed until as late as 2029 compared with a 2025 initial target.Sharpe, though, said the snags would not put the state at risk of power outages.\u201cIt\u2019s very challenging as the incoming minister to be told that things are going to cost more and take longer,\u201d she said.

How the rare palm \u2013 named Pinanga subterranea \u2013 has survived is a mystery, as most plants have evolved to develop their flowers and fruit above ground to facilitate pollination and the dispersal of seeds.\u201cPinanga subterranea is the only known species of palm to flower and fruit below ground,\u201d said Dr Benedikt Kuhnh\u00e4user, a future leader fellow at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, who was part of the research team that collected specimens and ascertained that it was a new species. \u201cFlowering and fruiting below ground is mind-boggling and seemingly paradoxical because they appear to prevent pollination and dispersal. We now know bearded pigs eat and disperse Pinanga subterranea\u2019s fruits, but we\u2019ve yet to find out how and by whom the flowers are pollinated.\u201dOnly a very small number of plant species have evolved to flower or fruit underground. But only one other plant is thought to do both. Exclusive flowering and fruiting below ground, as discovered in Pinanga subterranea, is incredibly rare,\u201d said Kuhnh\u00e4user. \u201cWe\u2019re only aware of one other plant that does that: the small underground orchid genus rhizanthella.\u201dThe fruits of Pinanga subterranea are eaten and dispersed by bearded pigs but the means of fertilisation are unclear. Photograph: Royal Botanical Gardens, KewKew\u2019s research team were first alerted to the plant\u2019s presence by Dr Paul Chai, a Malaysian botanist, who encountered the palm in 1997 during a visit to Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary in Sarawak. As well as studying the plants, Kew\u2019s team reviewed extensive reference collections of palms in botanical institutions in Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as at Kew. \u201cPinanga subterranea has separate male and female flowers in little clusters,\u201d said Kuhnh\u00e4user. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve only seen the female flowers, which are greenish-white and inconspicuous. The fruit is pale white when young, but bright red when ripe and up to two centimetres in size.\u201dNative to the tropical island of Borneo in south-east Asia, the one-of-a-kind palm was also found in Kalimantan in Indonesia.Agusti Randi, an Indonesian researcher at the National University of Singapore and lead author of a new report in Palms (the Journal of the International Palm Society) and Plants, People, Planet, first saw the palm in Kalimantan in 2017. \u201cI realised the stems, flowers and fruit were underground after the soil was dug up by boars, so it was as if the boars guided me to find this palm,\u201d Randi said.After meticulously comparing specimens with every other known Bornean species of the genus, Randi, an expert on Pinanga palms, helped to make the case that it was a novel species, later flying to the UK to collaborate with Kew. All the researchers from Indonesia, Malaysia and Kew then teamed up to describe the palm as new-to-science and publish their findings together.The palm was already known to local people but it had remained unnoticed by scientists. Photograph: William J Baker/Royal Botanical Gardens, KewThe palm was already known to local people but it had remained unnoticed by scientists, who believe the case highlights the need to collaborate more closely with Indigenous communities. \u201cLocal people in a remote village in central Kalimantan eat the fruits as a snack when doing activities in the forest,\u201d said Randi. \u201cIt has a sweet taste, with quite thick flesh and a soft and juicy texture. We still don\u2019t know about other uses of the plant, and there are many things that are still a mystery \u2013 for example, the process of pollination and who the pollinator is, and what causes this plant to produce flowers and fruit underground.\u201d\u201cCurrently, most botanists focus on the above-ground life of plants,\u201d added Kuhnh\u00e4user. \u201cThey rarely search for flowers and fruit below ground, partly because the phenomenon\u2019s thought to be so extremely rare. This new underground palm, together with the recent discovery of the first underground pitcher plant, Nepenthes pudica, is a wake-up call for scientists to look beyond the immediately visible and expect the unexpected.\u201dTo date, scientists have described about 300 different species of palm found on Borneo. Pinanga subterranea joins more than 2,500 species of palm known to science, up to half of which may be threatened with extinction.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

        "text": "International air fares are likely to keep climbing from their current highs over the next 10-15 years, with the cost of sustainable fuels expected to drive up ticket prices, according to the global airlines body Iata.Extraordinary demand for travel since the Covid pandemic has led to steep fare rises on many routes, and Iata said consumers could expect to pay more as airlines increase the usage of scarce \u201cgreener\u201d jet fuels in response to government mandates to cut aviation\u2019s carbon emissions.Willie Walsh, the director general of Iata and former chief executive of British Airways, said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to require more and more SAF [sustainable aviation fuel], and that means more and more expense.\u201dWhile Walsh said that some economists believed sustainable fuels could eventually become cheaper than kerosene, he added: \u201cI see certainty in the next 10-15 years that we\u2019re looking at a significant increase in fuel costs. Unless there\u2019s some compensating reduction in other costs \u2013 and I don\u2019t see that \u2013 then people have to expect that there will be an increase in in average fares as we go forward.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt will mean higher fares, because sustainable aviation fuel is more expensive than your traditional jet kerosene. And as we transition to net zero, it is going to cost some money.\u201dAirline costs have been driven up significantly as oil prices soared after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, as well as higher labour costs. Walsh also pointed to constrained capacity due to a lack of spare parts, which have left some airlines unable to operate their full fleets.Despite the much higher fares passengers are having to pay on many routes this summer, Iata said its analysis showed fares worldwide were still around 2019 levels in real terms at the start of 2023, having lagged behind inflation over the course of the pandemic.Last year, Ryanair said the era of ultra-cheap flying was over. The coming impact of SAFs was suggested in a recent update of the UK\u2019s sustainable aviation roadmap to net zero by 2050, which relies largely on offsetting and SAFs and replacing fleets with more fuel-efficient aircraft to slash net emissions.It projected that fewer people would fly in coming decades as a result of being priced out \u2013 a \u201cdemand reduction impact\u201d that would account for about 14% of the required cuts to hit the target.However, airlines are reporting rising custom despite higher prices.The president of Emirates airline, Sir Tim Clark, said the \u201ceye-opening\u201d demand for air travel, even in premium cabins at high fares, defied economic wisdom. He added: \u201cIn winter last year, for every seat we sold another five people wanted it \u2026 We could have put it out to auction if we\u2019d wanted to.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All I know is that we\u2019re moving \u2013 so we\u2019ll take it.\u201dClark, whose airline was a notable opponent of the capacity cuts imposed at London Heathrow last summer, warned the British government it needed to do more to support international aviation.Clark said: \u201cThe UK needs all the help it can get. If it\u2019s going to work with Brexit, and you\u2019ve said yah-boo Europe, it\u2019s not where we need to be, we need to be in China, India, Australia, America, then you\u2019ve got to move people and goods to those places.

independently and makes recommendations to the WA government about whether new developments should be granted environmental approval, said on Thursday it was setting a \u201chigher bar\u201d for how it would assess the impact of major projects on the climate.Australia's marine heatwaves provide a glimpse of the new ecological orderRead moreThe authority\u2019s chairman Tom Hatton told reporters in WA the move was necessary because Australia was not on track to meet its Paris targets and the current policies of the federal government \u201care not going to deliver the outcomes as currently applied that are necessary for Australia to meet its international obligations under the Paris agreement\u201d.Under the guidelines developers proposing projects with direct emissions of more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per annum would be required to demonstrate they have taken all \u201creasonable and practicable design measures\u201d, including use of renewable energy, to reduce or avoid emissions.They will also have to offset all net direct emissions associated with the project.The EPA\u2019s guidelines note that the Australian government\u2019s key climate policy, the emissions reduction fund and its safeguard mechanism, lacks \u201can effective carbon restraint or rate\u201d.The EPA also expressed concerned about the trajectory of WA\u2019s emissions, which had increased by 27% from 2000 to 2016.\u201cWestern Australia has the second highest per capita emissions of all Australian states and territories, with emissions per capita well above those of other developed economies, including resource-based economies such as Canada,\u201d the guidelines state.Environment groups have welcomed the policy as a \u201cbalanced approach\u201d that would bring environmental benefits and require polluters to make greater effort to reduce their carbon pollution.'Now' is the time for new coal plants, resources minister saysRead moreThe Wilderness Society said

of projects going forward, particularly LNG (liquefied natural gas) and, potentially, also fracking.\u201dSainsbury said it was an example of states stepping in, in the absence of effective federal policy to combat climate change.Australia\u2019s emissions continue to increase and the federal government has faced criticism this week for suggesting the opposite, based on one particular measurement of data from a single quarter.Much of the increase has been attributed to rising emissions associated with the LNG industry, particularly WA\u2019s Gorgon LNG plant.Australia's annual emissions continue to rise, driven by LNG productionRead moreThe Conservation Council of Western Australia said the new policy would deliver jobs and environmental benefits for the state.\u201cWhile this policy does not explicitly rule out new fossil fuel developments, it is a big step forward that could make a huge contribution to controlling pollution growth while helping to drive new sustainable industries for WA,\u201d the council\u2019s director Piers Verstegen said.The guidelines could have implications for major developments proposed for WA, including Woodside Energy\u2019s proposed $11bn Scarborough offshore gas project.A spokeswoman for Woodside said tackling climate change \u201cwhile providing the energy the world needs\u201d was a complex challenge.\u201cThe projects that Woodside is proposing in WA will not only underpin jobs, investment and gas supplies \u2013 they will also make a significant contribution to emissions reduction by offering countries the opportunity to switch to cleaner burning natural gas,\u201d she said.\u201cTo make investments like these, business needs stable, national \u2013 preferably international \u2013 policy frameworks,

associated emissions trajectory, raises further potential for conflict between regulation and jobs, and may perversely penalise investment in cleaner fuels such as natural gas which have a big role to play in global emissions reduction.The spokeswoman said the EPA had not consulted with proponents of projects that might be affected.The WA government said the guidance, released by the EPA as an independent authority, was not a government policy but set the EPA\u2019s expectations when considering greenhouse gas emissions related to a proposal.\u201cThe McGowan Government is fully supportive

Without action against the mice, the albatross is predicted to become extinct on the island, along with 18 of the 28 seabird species currently breeding there.\u201cThe need is urgent and clear for Marion Island\u2019s globally important seabirds which include the iconic wandering albatross, other albatrosses, petrels and prions,\u201d said Keith Springer, the operations manager for the Mouse-Free Marion project.The sooty albatross, which returns to the same breeding grounds each year, is an endangered species. Photograph: Otto Whitehead/Marion Island\u201cWhile the removal of mice from Marion Island brings clear benefits to the birds and other animal and plant species that live there, the value of this conservation intervention reaches far beyond the island\u2019s shoreline. Marion Island\u2019s seabirds are members of a regional seabird community innately connected to the functioning and health of the sub-Antarctic region.\u201dA fleet of helicopters will first be brought by sea from South Africa across the \u201croaring forties\u201d, the notoriously strong westerly winds in the Southern Ocean. In the southern hemisphere winter of 2025, these will be used to spread rodenticide bait across all 30,000 hectares of the island. This is the only method that has proven successful in eradicating rodents from large islands, such as South Georgia.Removing invasive species from small islands has been shown to be one of the most effective ways of restoring island ecosystems and boosting biodiversity, with humanity\u2019s spread of rodents, cats and foxes one of the key drivers of extinction for the unique species often found there.The Marion Islands are home to a quarter of the world\u2019s wandering albatross population.

        "text": "When the government controversially scrapped its discount on the purchase of electric cars last summer, the move was justified on the grounds that its work was done. After 11 years of subsidies, said ministers, the electric vehicle revolution had been \u201ckickstarted\u201d. As Britain strives to meet a 2030 target to end the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles, that judgment is beginning to look a little complacent.Amid ongoing economic headwinds, data has emerged that suggests a drop-off in current demand for electric cars, despite notable public enthusiasm for their adoption in principle. Auto Trader, which hosts the country\u2019s largest car sales website, reported this month that inquiries in relation to new electric vehicles had fallen significantly compared with last year.A number of factors are likely to be involved. As interest rates and inflation remain high, the upfront cost of a new electric car makes it more expensive in the short term than a petrol or diesel one. Falling oil prices may have diminished the immediate incentive to switch. At the same time, despite repeated pledges by Whitehall, the rollout of charging infrastructure continues to be too slow and is not keeping pace with sales.Under Boris Johnson, the government forecast that 300,000 publicly available chargers would be needed by 2030. Reaching that number would require the installation of 100 chargers a day, but the current rate is estimated to be around a fifth of that. For lower-income families without the option of charging their cars in garages or driveways, the problem is compounded by current electricity prices and the substantially higher VAT rate paid at public charging points.The net result is that while sales of electric vehicles are growing in absolute terms and company fleet sales are strong \u2013 partly as a result of specific incentives to employers \u2013 the electric share of the new vehicle market is not accelerating as it needs to. For mass adoption to take place in tough economic times, the government needs to do much more to make electric cars affordable through creative grants and subsidies. Loans should be cheaper and easier to access, offsetting upfront costs. The 20% VAT rate imposed on public charging points should be cut to match the 5% domestic energy tariff. The decision by the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, to end the exemption of electric cars from road tax from 2025 should also be rethought.A major societal transformation of this kind should not be attempted on the cheap, with the risk of creating losers along the way. Looming on the horizon, alongside the imperative of achieving environmental sustainability goals, is a question of social equity. If popular buy-in to the green transition is to be safeguarded, the choice of owning an electric vehicle must not be confined to more well-off early adopters and those fortunate enough to be entitled to a company car. Manufacturers must do more to develop affordable options if they are to meet mandated targets on the way to 2030. But the government should do more than simply wave a big stick and threaten punitive action from the sidelines if those targets are missed.The government\u2019s climate change committee has described the full transition to electric vehicles as one of the key actions in achieving the UK\u2019s net zero targets. Ministers risk failing to ensure that everyone is along for the ride.",

        "text": "The expansion of the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) to cover all of London means that from Tuesday travellers setting off for Heathrow airport will have to pay the daily charge for the first time if they use an older, more polluting car to get there.While people who regularly drive into the capital will probably be aware of the rollout of the scheme, the motorists most likely to be caught out are those making a rare visit to the airport when they go on holiday or those dropping off and picking up friends and family.Next week the zone will roughly double in size to include all 32 London boroughs. This means the same rules will apply at Heathrow, which is just off the M4 motorway near its interchange with the M25, as in central London.Ulez expansion: what you need to know \u2013 and how to get a charge-free carRead moreThose using vehicles that do not comply can still drive in the zone but must pay a \u00a312.50-a-day charge to Transport for London (TfL), which manages the scheme. The Ulez day runs from midnight to midnight every day, except on Christmas Day.Diesel cars and vans that do not meet Euro 6 standards (those typically bought new before 2015) do not comply. Nor do petrol cars and vans that are not Euro 4 or better (those typically bought new before 2006).Drivers can check their car\u2019s status by going to TfL\u2019s vehicle checker and inputting the registration. Don\u2019t assume that your vehicle does or does not comply. Some cars registered earlier than those dates above do, while others bought later don\u2019t.If you are visiting the airport in a noncompliant vehicle you will be expected to pay the charge via the TfL website or by using its phone service. Enter the zone at 11.30pm and leave an hour later and you will have to pay for both days you were in the zone.Road signs warn drivers that they are entering the Ulez zone and if you are required to pay the charge and fail to do so you can expect a \u00a390 penalty charge in the post.On top of this, for drivers going to Heathrow there is a \u00a35 drop-off charge and a minimum of \u00a36 charge at short-stay car parks (or free for up to 30 minutes at long-stay car parks). Previously, there was no charge. Drivers have to either log on or phone up with their registration number to pay. It must be paid by midnight on the day after your visit and nonpayment will result in an \u00a380 notice, reduced to \u00a340 if paid within 14 days. This article was amended on 29 August 2023. An earlier version said it was \u00a35 to drop off or pick up passengers at Heathrow airport. That is the charge for dropping off, but for picking up there is a minimum charge of \u00a36 at short-stay car parks and free for up to 30 minutes at long-stay car parks.",

        "text": "In a scene from the Oscar-winning best short documentary The Elephant Whisperers, Bellie instructs a young elephant calf to lie down in front of her. \u201cI\u2019ll beat you if you lie down on me,\u201d she says. As if telepathically connected, Raghu responds by gently folding into a heap and quietly placing his head in her lap. It is a miraculous moment that illustrates an astonishingly deep and unlikely maternal bond between a young elephant and his human caregiver. Raghu is at the heart of this documentary directed by Kartiki Gonsalves that uses a tender family dynamic in the middle of an Indian forest reserve to comment on climate change, shrinking animal habitats and our warped perception of the wild.\u201cI just found it beautiful that this little family had this unusual bond, especially in a time when we are struggling to coexist,\u201d Gonsalves says over a call from the US. In 2017, while driving back from Bengaluru to her hometown Ooty, a hill station in the Western Ghats of southern India, Gonsalves saw a caregiver giving a young calf called Raghu a bath. That\u2019s when it all began. She did not, however, begin shooting in earnest until she had earned the trust of both Bomman and Bellie, the middle-aged couple looking after young calves on the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve.The 42-min film has a warm, sunny texture but also operates in the shadow of tragedy and grief. \u201cRaghu is the living embodiment of climate change and shrinking habitats for Asian elephants. He lost his mother to an electrocution when their herd meandered into a nearby village. To me this bittersweet aspect of the story was crucial to what I wanted to say,\u201d Gonsalves says. Human-animal conflict is a huge problem in the southern Ghats of India, where migrating elephants and civilisation regularly come into contact to calamitous, often disastrous, effect. A government report last year found that more than 550 elephants had died of electrocution in the country over an eight-year period. There has obviously been a human cost as well.The elephant is considered both a religious figure in Indian folklore and a marauding wild animal. As a result, Gonsalves admits, her documentary might have become an exercise in dystopian speculation. \u201cI never wanted to take that route,\u201d she says. \u201cI think this is our opportunity, as humans, to think of animals as something more than the \u2018other\u2019. And it is also an opportunity to, as living beings, think of our place in this world\u201d.It\u2019s a question that the humans in The Elephant Whisperers embody. In one scene, Bellie tells a young girl a folktale about just how misunderstood the wild elephant has been. The caregivers belong to the indigenous Kattunayakan tribe, one of the many designated scheduled tribes of India. Tribal culture and lifestyle have historically been intertwined with the wild, curating a careful balance that Bomman summarises in the film as \u201cliving off it and with it\u201d. This doggedcommitment to the forest feels all the more perplexing and life-affirming considering the couple have also suffered because of wild animals. Bellie, for example, lost her ex-husband to an animal attack.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Film WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "As the impacts of the climate crisis multiply across the US, from intensified drought and wildfires in the west to stronger hurricanes in the east, a question is echoing ever louder: who should be held responsible?According to an unprecedented number of lawsuits filed by US cities and states that are currently making their way through the court system, the answer is fossil fuel companies.The lawsuits marshal a sweeping array of well-established facts that detail how for decades, major petroleum corporations knew that burning fossil fuels wreaked havoc on the environment. Industry elites heard dire warnings from their own scientists who predicted the urgency of the climate crisis nearly 60 years ago. But instead of taking swift action, the oil conglomerates staged a coordinated disinformation campaign to suppress political action and public awareness around the growing scientific consensus pointing to a climate emergency.Now, the lawsuits conclude, fossil fuel companies should pay for the damage they have helped to cause to the planet.The Guardian\u2019s new series, Climate crimes, launched in collaboration with the global media consortium Covering Climate Now, will examine these attempts to hold the industry accountable and investigate the tactics used by the companies to elide their own role in global heating. It will also interrogate the central question that emerges from these lawsuits: is the climate crisis in fact a crime scene? Much of the content produced for the series will be made available for Covering Climate Now\u2019s 400-plus partner news outlets to publish.There is a good reason to think we will know more soon. The legal process for the roughly two dozen climate change lawsuits currently pending in the US is likely to reveal more damning information that could further detail the extent of the oil industry\u2019s deceptions. Investigative reporting has already revealed that the companies undertook their own climate change research decades ago \u2013 in 1979, for instance, an Exxon study said that burning fossil fuels \u201cwill cause dramatic environmental effects\u201d in the coming decades, and concluded that \u201cthe potential problem is great and urgent.\u201d By copying the playbook utilized by big tobacco, the firms were able to sow doubt about the existence of the problem that persists to this day.The legal headaches for the industry are only likely to get worse. As the lawsuits move through the courts and reveal in greater detail what the oil companies knew and when, other states and cities can be expected to join the litigation. That in turn could add to the popular and political pressure on the petroleum giants to take the climate emergency seriously \u2013 and, perhaps, to make restitution.In addition to the lawsuits, there are other signs that the tide is turning for the fossil fuel industry. Over the course of a single day in May, the industry faced a series of embarrassing rebukes, as a Dutch court ordered Shell to cut its emissions by 45% and activist investors won seats on the ExxonMobil board of directors.At the same time, after decades of denying the true nature of the threat from global heating, the oil industry now says it is committed to a greener future through renewable energies and zero-carbon targets. Is this a sincere attempt to ameliorate a global crisis \u2013 or just one more public relations move by the petroleum giants to stave off the regulations and policies the planet urgently needs?To help raise awareness around the climate crisis and the role of fossil fuel companies, and to amplify the project\u2019s impact and reach, the Guardian and Covering Climate Now will be rolling out stories for the next year, especially in the lead up to the crucial COP 26 global climate summit in November. We also want to hear from fossil fuel insiders who can help us tell the story of the industry\u2019s role in climate change. Get in touch with us here.",

The global stocktake is a process mandated under the Paris agreement, intended to check every five years on countries\u2019 progress on meeting their emissions-cutting goals.Simon Stiell, the UN\u2019s climate chief, said the report offered a range of actions for governments to consider. \u201c[These are] clear targets which provide a north star for the action that is required by countries,\u201d he said.Greenhouse gas emissions are still rising but there is broad agreement they must peak by 2025 at the latest if there is to be a chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C.\u201cThis is a major opportunity being presented for the course correction that is so urgently called for,\u201d Stiell said. \u201c[The report] lays out elements that can be incorporated into a response.\u201d But while most countries agreed on the need to change direction, he said, there was \u201csignificant divergence\u201d on how to achieve the changes needed.Other proposals in the report include a tripling of renewable energy capacity and a doubling of energy efficiency globally by 2030. It was the second of two documents that will underpin discussions at Cop28. The first also contained proposals to phase out fossil fuels \u2013 a highly contentious issue that was sidelined at the last two UN climate summits, Cop27 in Egypt last year and Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021.However, there is no guarantee any such proposals will make it into any final outcome from the two weeks of negotiations at Cop28 or even that they will be on the official agenda for the summit.The global stocktake papers will be discussed next week at technical meetings of UN nations, and again at a \u201cpre-Cop\u201d meeting in Abu Dhabi at the end of this month. Stiell said it was for governments to determine what they would put on the agenda at Cop28, and for the host country, the United Arab Emirates, to \u201cshape what form this takes\u201d.Many campaigners are concerned that the UAE, as a major oil and gas producer, will not push for the phase-out of fossil fuels that more than 80 countries want.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Members of the public are asked to spend 15 minutes in a local park, garden or green space recording the butterflies they see.So far this year, numbers of common butterflies including small tortoiseshells and peacocks whose caterpillars were feeding on nettles late last summer are significantly lower than normal.Dr Zo\u00eb Randle, a senior surveys officer at Butterfly Conservation, said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re really concerned about is the survival rates of caterpillars from last summer. Small tortoiseshells have had a dreadful year so far, as have peacock butterflies, and the whites are doing quite poorly as well.\u201cWe want people to take part in the count to generate really important data so we can get a handle on how last summer\u2019s drought affected butterfly species.\u201dThere are fears that grass-feeding species have been struck particularly severely by last summer\u2019s heatwave, which turned the grass brown in meadows, fields and parks. Many experts are reporting lower numbers of ringlets than usual, but apparently good numbers of meadow browns and marbled whites have emerged earlier than normal. The Big Butterfly Count will help establish whether or not these species are bouncing back.Randle said that after the 1976 drought it took many of these widespread butterfly species a decade to recover their numbers.With many butterfly species in Britain at the northern edge of their European range, a warming climate should boost their numbers, but data shows that 80% of Britain\u2019s 59 species are declining in either abundance or distribution, with butterflies vanishing from half the places where they once flew since 1976.Last year\u2019s Big Butterfly Count produced the lowest abundance of butterflies in the 13 years of the popular survey. Conservationists attribute these declines to a combination of habitat loss, industrial farming and climatic changes. As temperatures rise, many butterflies cannot move north across inhospitable farmland to find suitable new sites, although a few more mobile species such as the purple emperor and the comma are managing to do this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Invasive species are increasingly likely to come to Britain because of lax post-Brexit trade rules, experts have warned.The EU has banned the import of soil in pot plants from the UK since Brexit, partly because invasive species such as the Asian hornet can travel undetected in soil. The UK has not put reciprocal bans in place, however, meaning damaging species from the continent could be transported in soil.Last week, it was revealed that this year has been the most prolific in England for Asian hornets, which kill native bees. There have been 45 Asian hornets, including 29 nests, seen in the country since the species was first observed in 2016, and this year there have been 22 sightings. This is a large increase since 2022, when only two Asian hornets were seen, and 2021, when there were also two sightings.The Asian hornets first came to Europe in 2004 when they were spotted in France, and it is thought they were accidentally transported in cargo from Asia. They rapidly spread across western Europe and have crossed the Channel to Britain, probably also in cargo.Thirty invasive animal species and 36 invasive plant species of concern have been identified by the government because of their ability to spread across Europe and the UK, and the harm they could cause to the environment.Matt Shardlow, the CEO of the insect charity Buglife, said that while domestic efforts to tackle invasive species such as Asian hornets had been commendable, post-Brexit biosecurity rules had not been up to scratch.He explained: \u201cOn biosecurity the government has left the door ajar. Asian hornets can arrive in growing material in imported potted plants and soil. Since Brexit the EU has banned the import of soil in pot plants from the UK; however, the UK has put no reciprocal biosecurity measures in place and indeed has recently again delayed addressing control of inward trade.\u201cSo as the Asian hornet spreads and proliferates on the continent, we are allowing their continued importation as stowaways into the UK.\u201dWhile it is possible for large insects to fly across the Channel, experts say it is more likely at least some have arrived in soil from potted plants. A recent study found that the dominant pathway for species invasions is the horticulture trade.The Windsor framework, which the government put in place to ease trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, also provides an avenue for invasive species to spread.Shardlow said: \u201cThe Windsor framework reduces the level of control of the importation of horticultural materials into Northern Ireland, meaning that should Asian hornets colonise the UK the door is open for them to cross the Irish Sea and colonise Ireland.\u2018Rewiggle\u2019 room: Lewes river channel project will create new wetlandRead more\u201cThe framework states that measures to ensure biosecurity of imports of various biological products into Northern Ireland from UK \u2018did not reflect any real-world biosecurity risk\u2019 \u2013 which is patent nonsense.\u201dA spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: \u201cThe UK operates one of the toughest borders in the world in protecting the nation from the introduction of pests and diseases.\u201d\u201cWhilst our analysis shows the arrival of Asian hornets on imported potted plants is very unlikely, we continue to work at speed to locate and investigate any reports of Asian hornets, and urge the public to continue to play their vital role in identifying and reporting them.\u201d",

I had crocheted rugs, a bean bag, a small seat and a floor covering.From the tent I felt and heard the beauty in many small things: the way the light came through the fabric walls; the birds, so close to me, feeding in the wet soil; the magpies singing all morning from high up in the dry branches of the gumtree; tiny wrens of yellow and grey, a mass of them flitting in the tea tree; wattlebirds clacking; and the lift and lilt of the currawongs carolling.Currawong whip! There was the symphony of the other birds behind them, but the sense of presence, the uplift and the swirl, the heft and weight of existence, that came from the currawongs.Why I\u2019m voting No 1 galah in the bird of the year poll | Tracy SorensenRead moreThe pied currawong (Strepera graculina) are named for their onomatopoeic song. They nest in a bowl of sticks, lined with grasses and other soft material, usually high up in a eucalyptus trees.Black, with flashes of white under their tails, their habitat is eastern Australia, distinct from some species of currawong that live in Tasmania, the grey currawong, and the black currawong which inhabit southern areas of Australia.Known to raid other birds\u2019 nests, these beady-eyed, bulletproof birds are not always appreciated. They stamp their claim on places and spaces as they land with a thud on the protea limb, with a clattering on the corrugated iron roof and with a clunk on the wood paling fence.When I ask urban ecologist Darryl Jones his opinion of currawongs, he muses: \u201cHmmm. Evil-eyed marauders or simply clever characters?\u201dA woman tells me her family calls them \u201ccaravan park birds\u201d, and I think that suits them, for they are birds that sing to me of escape and travel. They are an adaptive species, moving through changing landscapes and climes. Once a bird mainly found in the highlands, who visited the lowlands in winter, they now have a significant presence in the urban zones of the eastern states.Jones, author of the book Getting to Know the Birds in Your Neighbourhood, says of the currawong: \u201cThey are indeed on the move but it is more altitudinal than longitudinal. It\u2019s still \u2013 at least partially \u2013 climate related. In recent decades they have found that towns provide lots of resources they can use and a lot have opted to stay low and even breed at the lower latitudes. And because they are incredibly efficient nest predators, [and] some are now breeding in the same locations as other birds, they are having a huge impact on the smaller species in particular.\u201d\u2018Evil-eyed marauders or simply clever characters?\u2019 A currawong nests in a tree in Canberra. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPBut they are not all displacement and destruction.The currawong also has a role to play in the raising of other birds\u2019 eggs, playing foster parent to the chicks of the channel-billed cuckoo, who lay their eggs in the currawong\u2019s nest and then rack off to let the currawong raise their babies. Currawongs\u2019 own chicks may perish in the process, but this is nature: brutal, adaptable and interlinked.As David George Haskell, author of The Songs of Trees, writes:\u2018Tiny little balls of pure joy\u2019: why the superb fairywren took our 2021 Australian bird of the yearRead more\nWe\u2019re all\u2013trees, humans, insects, birds, bacteria\u2013pluralities.

During radiotherapy treatment, while the blasts of 40 gray targeted my breast and chest wall, I had asked for a soothing soundtrack to lift me through the fear. The radiologists had served up birds.Each time I had to hold my breath against the blasts, the birds held me safe until I was able to breast the oxygen wave and breathe again on the shore.When I hear the currawong\u2019s song, it is to me an invitation to travel through time, space and hopefulness; it\u2019s a flight path that speaks to me of safely coming home, to build my nest and notice life and all its songs around me.From the high ranges to the cities, from the lowlands to the caravan parks, the currawong\u2019s songs have been one of my sustaining soundscapes.

That stark warning surely applies to southern Europe as a whole, as the prospect of another summer crisis looms, following a disastrously dry winter.An absence of melting snow from the Alps has left Italy\u2019s Po River as shallow as during last year\u2019s searingly hot summer. In January and February, France recorded the highest number of rain-free days since records began, and water restrictions are in place in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales region. About 90% of mainland Portugal is suffering from drought, judged to be severe in one-fifth of the country. In Spain, from Catalonia to Andaluc\u00eda, unseasonable heat has contributed to reservoirs drying up and a disastrous drop in olive oil production. By the middle of this month, southern Spain had received barely 30% of expected rainfall. As temperatures continue to rise, and Europe warms faster than the global average, drought across vast swathes of territory is simply becoming the norm.There are obvious moves that can be made to alleviate water shortages. A quarter of drinking water in Europe is lost because of leaky pipelines. In Italy \u2013 one of the worst offenders in this respect \u2013 a drought taskforce has been created to improve water infrastructure. In France, Emmanuel Macron has set a 10% water savings target for all sectors of the economy by 2030 and demanded far greater reuse of wastewater. New, low-energy desalination techniques will be key to guaranteeing future supplies of water for human consumption.There is, however, no foreseeable technical fix that will allow difficult decisions over an increasingly scarce resource to be evaded. The politics of a new, parched reality will be fraught and contested, particularly in relation to food production in transformed terrain. In France, plans for new reservoirs to irrigate farmland have led to violent clashes between police and environmental protesters, who argue that agricultural practices need to become less water-intensive.In Andaluc\u00eda, regional proposals to legalise irrigation in part of the Do\u00f1ana Natural Space \u2013 one the world\u2019s most important wetlands \u2013 have become a wedge issue ahead of local elections this weekend. Vox, a far-right party which has made political gains through downplaying the severity of the climate emergency, has positioned itself as a champion of the strawberry farmers who would benefit from the plans. In Seville, thousands have demonstrated against the project, which has been condemned by both Madrid and the European Commission.Global heating will eventually force rural economies such as those in Andaluc\u00eda to diversify to survive. They will require substantial assistance from both national governments and the European Union to do so. More needs to be done to help those who find themselves at the sharp end of an emerging crisis for agricultural production. An absence of proper economic support will breed dangerous resentment in regions that have traditionally prided themselves on supplying Europe\u2019s fruit, vegetable and cereal needs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Experts argue various tax perks are incentivising the uptake of larger vehicles and Australians are paying billions of dollars extra at the bowser each year to fuel these cars.Dr Jennifer Rayner, the head of advocacy at the Climate Council, said \u201cwhile it\u2019s true that electric vehicles and utes might not be accessible in the near future for everyone\u201d, there needs to be an interim solution to address the emissions impact.SUVs dominate the new vehicle market\u201cIf people really need a ute for work today, there are much more efficient and cheaper-to-run utes out there than most Australians are buying,\u201d Rayner said.\u201cPeople who want to cut their fuel bill and emissions can do that without waiting for any new technology. There are vehicles on the market right now.\u201d\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe report found the two top-selling utes in Australia, the Toyota HiLux and the Ford Ranger, are among the most expensive to run and have poor tailpipe CO2 emissions, while other popular utes such as the Toyota LandCruiser are considerably worse.However, the report highlights some readily available models that are fuel efficient, such as the Mazda BT-50.Emissions and fuel costs for the top ten selling ute models\u201cIf in the next five years everyone in the market for a ute bought the most efficient 2022 model, this would cut collective fuel bills by $210m over that period and avoid 436,600 tonnes of harmful CO2 emissions being pumped into our atmosphere,\u201d the report said.Rayner also said consumer choice would play an important role in decarbonising Australia\u2019s transport industry and Australians should only be buying utes and large vehicles if they require them.However, she noted demand for electric and more efficient vehicles in Australia is already high, but a lack of government policy means there is insufficient supply for the local market.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This provides an incentive for manufacturers to supply low and zero-emissions vehicles to a country, Rayner said, and penalises companies for failing to do so.\u201cRight now manufacturers have no incentive to bring cleaner vehicles here because they lose out on incentives if they don\u2019t take them to other markets that do have standards. That\u2019s why they\u2019re bringing their most polluting cars to our market,\u201d Rayner said.\u201cFuel-efficiency standards can put Australia at the front of the queue for those zero and low-emissions vehicles.\u201cIf we don\u2019t make any policy interventions, we\u2019re just going to keep getting the high emissions and high-polluting vehicles we currently are.\u201dRayner also noted a Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries study this week that found emissions from utes and large SUVs have exceeded the body\u2019s voluntary emissions targets. Carbon emissions from heavy SUVs and light commercial vehicles, including utes, rose to 212.8 grams per kilometre in 2022, far exceeding the industry target of 189 grams.\u201cThese results highlight why Australia needs strong mandatory fuel-efficiency standards to save Australians money on their petrol bills and drive down transport emissions. Car manufacturers set themselves a weak voluntary standard and still missed it by a mile last year for some types of vehicles,\u201d Rayner said.",

The fundamental problem that we have right now in the market, which is both preventing it from being a force for good and preventing it from scaling to a level that matters for the climate, is that it\u2019s very hard to tell the difference,\u201d he said.\u201cThe role of the integrity councils is to say what good looks like and we\u2019re going to let the chips fall where they may. We are going to do it in a way that listens to all stakeholders and takes into account feasibility, but we are going to come out with what high integrity looks like,\u201d said Keohane.This month\u2019s new standards only cover the organisations that certify carbon credits, with a separate process going on to develop guidelines for the claims that businesses can make about their use of offsets. Many firms that buy offsets then label their products \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d or tell their consumers they can fly, buy new clothes or eat certain foods without making the climate crisis worse.\u201cWe are really pushing the market on best practice,\u201d said William McDonnell, chief operating officer of the ICVCM. \u201cIn any well functioning market, scrutiny and enabling scrutiny is absolutely vital.

With careful management he believed the island could navigate the next two months, after which rain was expected.\u201cWe are not complacent. We are trying to solve the situation. We don\u2019t want the provincial or upper [administration] to announce that Koh Samui is a disaster zone,\u201d he saidSamui, famous for its white sandy beaches, scenic temples and luxury resorts, often struggles with a lack of fresh water during the dry season between March and May. It\u2019s feared the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, which is associated with less rain, will result in more severe shortages this year.Jutharath, who works in a massage parlour in the Bo Phut area, and who asked to give only one name, said that for the past three months, taps had worked only one or two days a week. \u201cThere was a time when it was gone, no water coming out at all for the whole week,\u201d she said.She was buying water from pick-up trucks, and had tanks and a small pool to save supplies.\u201cMy neighbour, sometimes they even need to walk to the temple nearby, just to use the bathroom because there is no water,\u201d said Jutharath, who said she had never experienced such bad shortages.\u201cI have a massage shop and rooms for rent. It\u2019s really affected the business,\u201d she said.Ratchaporn Poolsawadee, the president of the Tourism Association of Koh Samui, said that rather than benefiting from a resurgence in tourist arrivals this year, businesses were instead having to use their profits to buy water. Not only was this costly, but supplies were also scarce, he added.\u201cWhen you run out of it you can\u2019t just purchase it immediately, you need to plan ahead,\u201d he added. \u201cEveryone needs water at the same time.\u201dThe number of rooms available on the island, including in hotels and villas, fell to just 5,000 during the pandemic. It has since recovered to 25,000, the same level as 2019, according to Ratchaporn.As a result, problems such as water and waste management are also re-emerging.Dr Kannapa Pongponrat Chieochan, an assistant professor at Thammasat University who has researched water-saving initiatives in Koh Samui, said the shortages of fresh water were rooted in poor planning.Infrastructure had struggled to keep up with the size of the population on the island, which had grown substantially as people moved from across Thailand to work in its growing tourism industry, said Kannapa.At the same time, the island had also witnessed a rapid development of resorts, hotels, golf courses and spas, she said.\u201cSamui has so many spas, with pool villas, and based on my research we found it\u2019s the big corporates, big hotels, the 4 or 5 star resorts, the luxury ones, where there is a lot of water [consumption] \u2013 and the communities around that kind of property suffer from insufficient water because it\u2019s all pumped into the resort,\u201d she said.While big businesses were able to pay for supplies from water trucks, smaller operators and local people were more vulnerable, said Kannapa.Sutham said Samui needed 30,000 cubic metres of water a day. The majority, 24,000 cubic metres, would be brought to the island through an underwater pipeline from Surat Thani on the mainland, while reservoir supplies would be used for the remaining amount.An additional 30,000 cubic metres would also be brought in on Monday to boost the reservoir supplies, according to the Provincial Waterworks Authority.\u201cI would like to ask people to save water, use it sparingly. If we help each other, we can go through this,\u201d said Sutham.",

We found that activity is higher in the areas with wolves.\u201d said Dr Francesca Brivio, who co-authored the study with colleagues at the University of Ferrara.In conjunction with findings of similar studies, the research supports the hypothesis that increasing night-time activity may be a common strategy for mammals to deal with heat stress caused by global heating.Brivio said: \u201cWe can expect that during the night when the temperature is lower other animals will shift their activity towards the nocturnal hours. If during the day it is too hot to eat or to be active, they will prefer to perform all their activities, like foraging, at night\u201dHigher levels of nocturnal activity among Alpine ibex could affect the animal\u2019s population dynamics.Brivio said: \u201cAs they are animals adapted to diurnal activity, being active during the night is probably harder. Their movement in the rocky slopes where they live is probably more difficult, which could make the foraging efficiencies and foraging strategies less efficient. Although we did not collect data on this, we can conjecture that their capacity to acquire food will be lower [during the night] and this will have consequences on fitness and population dynamics.\u201cA shift towards nocturnal activity will also increase their overlap with night-time predators; that again has consequences on population dynamics\u201d.Increased nocturnal activity among animals to deal with heat stress caused by global warming could also have consequences for how animals are recorded in the future.\u201cGenerally census activities are conducted with direct observation during daylight areas \u2026 In the future animals will be more active during the night \u2026 so we will have to find other techniques to count animals.\u201d",

However, there is only \u00a3110m up for grabs and it will be doled out on a first-come, first-served basis, with car drivers having to vie with van, motorbike and minibus owners for the money.It is just the latest scrappage scheme to resume in the UK, joining others in Birmingham, Bristol and Scotland, which all have their own low emissions zones.German visitor fined \u00a33,150 for driving in London\u2019s Ulez zoneRead moreSince 2019, drivers of most petrol cars first registered before 2006 (those with Euro 3 engines and below) and most diesel cars bought up to 2015 (not Euro 6) have been deemed too polluting to drive in London\u2019s Ulez, which was expanded to include all roads within the north and south circulars in October 2021. Noncompliant vehicles can still drive in it but must pay a \u00a312.50 daily charge.With the zone to be expanded again on 29 August, TfL has relaunched its scrappage scheme, in part to counter claims that the Ulez adversely affects the poorest households. It is thought that about 15% of vehicles in the newly enlarged area will not comply.To be eligible for the scrappage payments, drivers have to live in one of the capital\u2019s 32 boroughs, have a disability, or be in receipt of one of a long list of benefits. These include universal credit, carer\u2019s allowance, child tax credit, income support and jobseeker\u2019s allowance.The applicant must have owned the car they want to scrap on 30 January 2022. This is to stop people going out and buying old bangers and then applying. The car in question also has to be insured.Applicants can\u2019t have received payment under the previous TfL scrappage scheme when 15,000 older vehicles were taken off the road.Once the owner has been accepted, produced all the evidence, and a certificate from the scrapyard to show that the vehicle was destroyed, they will receive a \u00a32,000 cash payment for a car, or \u00a31,000 for a motorcycle.Interestingly, users can also opt for a part cash payment and one or two adult annual bus and tram passes instead. Car scrappers can receive \u00a31,600 in cash and one annual bus pass, or \u00a31,200 cash and two passes, which TfL says is worth \u00a33,000.London-based sole traders, registered charities and small businesses of up to 10 employees may also apply for the van and minibus scrappage scheme, which includes grant payments of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a39,500.Owners of older, specially converted, wheelchair-accessible cars or vans have the option of scrapping it and taking \u00a35,000 cash, or the same amount towards retrofitting a new engine or an electric conversion that will make the vehicle compliant. The retrofit payment only applies to vans, not converted cars.It is not only in the capital that drivers are being paid to scrap their old cars. In Birmingham, drivers can get \u00a32,000 in public transport travel credits, or \u00a32,000 towards the purchase of a compliant car through Motorpoint. In that case you need to live outside the low emissions zone and earn less than \u00a330,000 a year.There is a similar scheme in Bristol, while in Scotland there is up to \u00a33,000 in help, provided you live within a 20km radius of such a zone and are in receipt of benefits.

This is despite classification standards for bathing waters being made stricter in 2015, it claims.The announcement follows the publication last week of the government\u2019s Plan for Water, which said water companies could face unlimited fines for dumping raw sewage in rivers, and outlined proposals that could see wet wipes containing plastic banned.Labour said the plan amounted to a rehash of old policies and claimed the measures would not stop sewage being dumped.The water minister, Rebecca Pow, said: \u201cThese popular swimming spots will now undergo regular monitoring, starting this May, so bathers have up-to-date information on the quality of the water. The regular monitoring also means that action can be taken if minimum standards aren\u2019t being met.\u201cWe now have more bathing waters than ever, and we\u2019ve worked hard in recent years to boost their status \u2013 with an incredible 93% now classed as good or excellent \u2013 and our new Plan for Water will help us go further and faster on our targets.\u201dThe Environment Agency will take regular samples at the newly designated sites during the bathing season, which runs from 15 May and 30 September.

It also runs counters to the US voters\u2019 political views based on new polling shared exclusively with the Guardian and Floodlight.floodlight embedThe power plant rules, first proposed in May, would force power providers to clean up certain large coal- and gas-fired plants, either by installing new greener technologies or shutting the projects down. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is asking states and utilities to submit plans on how they choose to limit those emissions within 24 months of the rules\u2019 final approval.Public comments must be submitted by 8 August.EEI is circulating a draft comment on the rule to its member groups which were described by first-hand sources to Craig Segall, vice-president of policy at Evergreen Action. The draft says EPA\u2019s proposed transition timelines are too strict and that the technology it would require is difficult to install, Segall said.EEI has previously asked the EPA to exclude these power plants from its emission-reduction rule in a series of white papers submitted to the agency.\u201cEEI is working with our members to finalize extensive comments that are intended to help EPA develop final rules that support the ongoing clean energy transition, prioritize customer affordability and are legally durable,\u201d EEI spokesperson Brian Reil said in an email. \u201cThere are elements of the proposal that are favorable, and we are making recommendations to strengthen them; elements that are fixable with additional flexibilities; and elements that miss the mark.\u201dThe proposal would serve the White House\u2019s goals to zero-out power sector emissions by 2035 and achieve a net-zero economy by 2050.Power plant emissions made up roughly one-quarter of the carbon emissions in the US last year, federal data shows. Electric companies have been closing older, less-efficient coal-fired plants over the past decade, and 50 EEI members have announced carbon-reduction goals, according to the lobbying group.Utilities from the west coast to the south-east began announcing emission-reduction goals towards the end of the last decade. Edison International, owner of Southern California Edison Co, has set a 2045 net-zero greenhouse gas emission goal, which aligns with California\u2019s climate targets economy wide, according to the company\u2019s website.Alliant Energy, which serves Iowa and Wisconsin, wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions 80% from 2005 levels by 2040 on its way to becoming net zero a decade later.The companies\u2019 objectives often are nuanced, with some stating that their goals are \u201caspirational\u201d. Some include a broader range of emissions, including those that the utility cannot directly control.Floodlight and the Guardian contacted 10 of EEI\u2019s member utilities that have publicly discussed climate or carbon-reduction goals. Of the ones that responded, most deferred to EEI for comment or said they would make their comments available after the filing deadline.\u201cEEI members are in the middle of a profound, long-term transformation in how electricity is generated, transmitted and used,\u201d the trade group said in a February paper submitted to the EPA.But Evergreen Action\u2019s Segall said EEI\u2019s opposition to the new proposal, which he described as \u201cmodest\u201d and \u201ca bare minimum regulation\u201d, indicates that they are broadly resistant to enforced change.EEI\u2019s resistance to the new standards clashes voters\u2019 beliefs, new polling from Evergreen and Data for Progress suggests. A majority of all likely voters support EPA proposed pollution standards and also want utility companies to prioritize renewable energy like wind and solar over fossil fuels, according to the data.A bipartisan majority also opposed utility companies using money from energy bills to fund political activities such as lobbying and issuing public comments, according to the poll, which was based on an online survey of 1,216 diverse likely US voters conducted in late July.\u201cRegardless of your politics, you probably don\u2019t think it\u2019s your utility\u2019s job to express their private corporate interests,\u201d said Segall.\nThis story is co-reported with Floodlight, a news nonprofit  that partners with local outlets and the Guardian to investigate the corporate and ideological interests holding back climate action.\n",

As Keir said in his conference speech in September, this means there will be good Labour things we want to do but won\u2019t be able to promise.We face a huge deficit of trust in politics too. It\u2019s a far bigger problem for us than it is for the Tories. As Britain\u2019s progressive party, Labour is where people turn when they believe things can get better.

Wood and smokeless fuels are being sold in local DIY shops and garages, and once again my neighbourhood is filled with the smell of smoke.A fire may look cosy but it comes with a wider cost. Last year\u2019s chief medical officer\u2019s report recognised that solid fuels are by far the most polluting way to heat a home.A study, by Ricardo Energy and Environment, has estimated that 284 Londoners are now dying early each year due to outdoor air pollution from solid fuel heating. They also estimated about 90 new cases of asthma in children, 60 new cases of stroke and 30 new lung cancer cases each year.This creates annual health and economy cost of \u00a3187m, or \u00a324 per Londoner, regardless of whether they burn solid fuels or not. Taking a polluter-should-pay perspective, this is an average burden of almost \u00a3800 a year created by each person in London who uses a fireplace or stove.The London study is broadly in line with a European-wide estimate of \u20ac760 (\u00a3650) yearly societal-health cost for each household that uses a wood stove.Prof Fay Johnston, from the Menzies Institute for Medical Research, Tasmania, who was not involved in the London research said: \u201cGiven the high health and economic burden of pollution from this type of heating, interventions to reduce wood heaters in densely populated areas will be highly cost effective. Even small reductions in outdoor wood smoke will reduce the community burden of chronic heart and lung diseases, and increase the average life expectancy of people living in London.\u201dAccording to UK government figures, home use of solid fuels is the second largest source of airborne particle pollution in the UK. Although some burning takes place outside, such as patio heating in summer, solid fuel pollution is mainly measured during winter evenings when people are heating their homes.This problem is not confined to London nor to big cities.In Chorley, Lancashire Mark Tebbutt has worked with friends and neighbours to install measurement equipment across the town. Their data shows frequent breaches of World Health Organization guidelines and reveals the burning habits of the residents.Tebbutt explained: \u201cChorley has a high number of older terrace houses with fireplaces and the smell of burning often wafts through my home. Solid fuel burning mainly takes place during the weekend evenings, Fridays to Sundays, from October to April but has increased in the cost-of-living crisis.\u201dThe new study was part of the London Wood Burning Project, which is funded by Defra and has 18 councils taking part.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Researchers also walked about 125 miles (200km) of streets with backpacks loaded with sensors.The main indoor exposure happened when fires were first lit or fuel was added, although this was often less than the indoor particle pollution when people were smoking cigarettes or cooking. The researchers also found particle pollution immediately outside homes that burned solid fuel, including outside a home with the most modern type of stove.Persistent wood burning hotspots were found in residential streets. The existence of hotspots is reflected in national surveys of complaints from people who find that their homes are being polluted by neighbours\u2019 fires.John Casey from Imperial College London, who led the fieldwork investigation, said: \u201cIn the end our noses proved a pretty good detector for wood and coal burning.

Some conservationists say not enough space was reserved for the cheetahs while others complained that the project was set up too hastily.However, project scientists insisted that several fatalities were to be expected at the start of the project, and forecast that the death toll would stabilise in the near future.\u201cIf you are going to reintroduce an animal to the wild, you have to do it very carefully,\u201d said Professor Sarah Durant, of the Zoological Society of London. \u201cAnd it is clear that things are not going well. The programme seems rushed.\u201dView image in fullscreenA male cheetah on a reserve in South Africa. Photograph: Sylvain CORDIER/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesCheetahs are the world\u2019s fastest land animals and can run at speeds of up to 65mph. There are five subspecies and all have suffered major drops in numbers caused by climate change, hunting by humans and habitat destruction. As a result, surviving populations of East African, South African and Northeast African cheetahs are now vulnerable, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The other two \u2013 the Northwest African cheetah and the Asiatic cheetah \u2013 are critically endangered.India\u2019s own population of cheetahs \u2013 made up of the Asiatic subspecies \u2013 was wiped out last century, with the last documented native animals being shot by Maharajah Ramanuj Singh Deo in 1947. The Asian cheetah now survives only in Iran.By contrast, there are about 6,500 African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), and there have been successes in restoring numbers in semi-managed wildlife reserves in South Africa. With the eradication of its own cheetahs, India launched efforts to re-establish a population using the Southern African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus). However, these moves were blocked, initially, by the Indian supreme court, where it was argued that because it was not a native species, its introduction broke international conservation regulations.In 2020, the court\u2019s ruling was overturned and Project Cheetah was launched with considerable fanfare, including support from the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. The first animals \u2013 eight cheetahs that had been relocated from Namibia \u2013 arrived at Kuno last September, and 12 more were moved from South Africa in February.However, by late May this year, three of the Kuno cheetahs and three newborn cubs had died . Two adults succumbed to organ failure and a third was killed in a violent mating encounter. The cause of the deaths of the cubs is unclear at present. While cubs in the wild have poor survival rates owing to predation from lions and hyenas, those born in protected reserves have high survival rates.The deaths of the three adults were not unexpected given the high stress of relocation, said Adrian Tordiffe, a veterinarian at South Africa\u2019s University of Pretoria and a consultant for the project, in the journal Nature. \u201cThe fact that we had multiple deaths occurring in a short space of time is not unusual in the sense that it\u2019s the high-risk period. Once things stabilise, that will plateau.\u201dView image in fullscreenMaharajah Ramanuj Singh Deo with the three male cheetahs he killed. Photograph: Van Ingen and Van Ingen (Firm)\u200f/JBNHSHowever, Prof Durant was more critical. \u201cKuno is a relatively small park and does not have a great deal of prey for cheetahs to hunt,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some cases, that will lead cheetahs to roam outside the park. That has happened but it seemed to take the authorities by surprise. A reintroduction of a large carnivore like a cheetah should have been supported by an extensive community engagement programme ahead of any release.\u201cAny country that re-introduces a large carnivore deserves to be applauded,\u201d she added. \u201cHowever, there does seem to be an excessive number of losses at Kuno, and they seem to be happening in circumstances in which I would not expect there to be losses like these. So I think there needs to be a rethink of how they\u2019re managing Cheetah Project and a halt to future re-introductions for the moment.\u201d",

Seven months on from the information commissioner\u2019s order to publish, Southern is taking the case to the first-tier tribunal to appeal against the ruling and to keep the documents secret.First reported in Private Eye, the 53 documents relate to discussion at board level in 2020 and 2021, including agendas and minutes of meetings of the board discussing sewage spills or storm overflows.Ofwat, the industry\u2019s regulator, has promised to apply new scrutiny to the boardrooms of water companies.Southern has tried to cite exceptions under the environmental information request (EIR) rules to defend its decision not to release the documents. But the information commissioner has said the exceptions largely do not apply and there is a public interest in releasing the documents.The company argued that the documents should remain secret because of \u201cthe need to protect Southern Water\u2019s internal processes of deliberation and decision-making and with regard to the sensitivity of the information and the circumstances surrounding the request\u201d. The company said the request for the documents on sewage spills or overflows in 2020-2021 related to live issues and should not be published.But the commissioner said the public interest favoured disclosing the information, and said there was even greater public interest because the company had pleaded guilty in July 2021 to 51 individual offences of discharging sewage illegally. Evidence presented showed the company had presented a picture of compliance to regulators that was deliberately misleading.\u201cSet against this backdrop, the commissioner considers that there is a substantial and weighty public interest in understanding what measures the public authority was taking, during the period covered by the request, to improve its performance and put measures in place to prevent a recurrence of the offences,\u201d the information commissioner has said.Ed Acteson, of the campaign group SOS Whitstable, said: \u201cSouthern is repeatedly saying it is going to be more transparent but we are just not sure that is the case.\u201dHe said data on the company\u2019s Beachbuoy app had recently been changed to make it more difficult for the public to see where raw sewage discharges were taking place or their impact.Last year Southern was accused of \u201cenvironmental vandalism\u201d after discharging raw sewage for more than 3,700 hours at 83 bathing water beaches during the first eight days of November alone.The information commissioner said the company operated a monopoly and if customers were dissatisfied with the way wastewater was being handled, they did not have the right to ask another company to handle it instead.\u201cOne of the few powers consumers do have, is to make use of the EIR to seek environmental information such as this and use that information to hold the public authority to account, the information commissioner said.Southern Water said as there was a court process under way it could not comment.",

Of these, 75 were identified as Hyundai-branded.The arrival in recent years of hydraulic excavators in the Brazilian Amazon has dramatically accelerated the expansion of illegal gold mining there. One of these machines can in 24 hours perform work that would take three men 40 days to complete, the report said.This increased efficiency is pushing wildcat miners ever deeper into supposedly protected areas of the forest in search of new gold deposits, said Danicley de Aguiar, senior forest campaigner at Greenpeace Brazil.The Guardian saw diggers wrecking Yanomami land last December. Excavators are believed to have only recently been moved into Brazil\u2019s largest Indigenous reserve, where the large-scale invasion of illegal miners combined with the neglect of the previous Jair Bolsonaro government has produced a humanitarian catastrophe.Cleared Kayapo\u0301 Indigenous land.

Several African birds of prey are on track to become locally extinct in many countries this century.Published in the journal, Nature Ecology and Evolution, the new research used road surveys to find that nearly 90% of the 42 raptor species studied had experienced declines, with more than two-thirds showing evidence of being globally threatened.Dr Phil Shaw, the study\u2019s author at the University of St Andrews, said the disappearance of apex raptor species could have unintended consequences for humans, citing the example of the decline in Indian vultures that led to a rise in rabies cases in humans in the early 1990s.The study found that the African birds of prey, many of which are big enough to hunt jackals and antelopes as well as snakes, rodents and smaller birds, were becoming increasingly dependent on protected areas such as national parks and reserves. While many populations of raptors also declined in protected areas, the fall was often significantly slower. The researchers cited the importance of a UN target to protect 30% of the Earth by the end of this decade for nature.View image in fullscreenAfrican vultures in South Africa. The new research shows that many birds of prey are declining, even in protected areas.

In effect, they have nowhere else to run.\u201dShaw said a 2015 study of African vultures, which found many were critically endangered due to poisoning and persecution, was the inspiration for the wider research.What happens when humans meddle with nature?Read more\u201cWe\u2019ve looked at 42 species of raptors that also include the vulture species. We find that surprisingly, many of the larger raptors have been declining at an equally fast rate as the vultures,\u201d he said.The declines were most prominent in west Africa, according to the study, which they said was consistent with agricultural expansion and under-resourcing of protected areas. Shaw said there could be unforeseen consequences for places where raptors disappeared.\u201cIn the case of the vultures, it\u2019s fairly clear cut that they provide an ecosystem service by removing carcasses. We\u2019ve seen what happened in India when they had a similar population crash for different reasons.

A passing cargo ship rescued the 20 crew onboard.The Philippine Coast Guard is deploying oil spill booms and absorbent booms to try to minimise damage, according to the environment department, which said it was \u201ccontinuously assessing the important biodiversity sites\u201d.Ram Temena, the disaster operations chief in the affected province of Oriental Mindoro, told Agence France-Presse an oil slick off Mindoro island, south of the capital, Manila, stretched for 120km (75 miles) and was about 9km (5.5 miles) offshore.Oriental Mindoro\u2019s 18,000 registered fishers have been told to stay onshore until it was safe to fish, according to Agence France-Presse.Pola town in Oriental Mindoro, one of the worst affected areas, has been placed under a state of calamity due to the spill. The town\u2019s mayor, Jennifer Cruz, told the Philippines media network GMA that the seawater and shoreline had turned black. \u201cYou can see the oil spill in the waves. Fish were dying. Our white sand is now black sand,\u201d Cruz said.The environment department said this week that 21 marine protected areas could be affected, including seagrass beds, mangroves and pathways for fish larvae.Environmental campaigners are especially concerned about risks posed to the Verde Island Passage, a strait that separates the Philippine islands of Luzon and Mindoro, which has been described as the centre of global shore-fish biodiversity. It is also a source of food and livelihoods for more than 2 million people, according to Conservation International.Protect VIP, a coalition that seeks to protect the Verde Island Passage (VIP), has called on the government to expedite cleanup operations to minimise the damage, and for companies involved to be held accountable.\u201cWe are concerned that this incident will stunt growth and reproduction of fish, shellfish, mangroves, seagrasses, and coral reefs, and cause death even to sea birds exposed to the leaked oil. Fish catch will be reduced, and any seafood that reaches the table of communities and consumers are already a threat to their health,\u201d said Gerry Arances, the co-convenor of Protect VIP and executive director of the Center of Energy, Ecology, and Development.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Immediate containment, assessment of the severity, and assistance to nearby coastal communities must be provided,\u201d added Arances.The Philippine Coast Guard confirmed on Thursday that seawater samples had been found to be contaminated not only with the fuel that powered the vessel, but also with oil from the cargo. The amount of oil that has leaked is unclear.The environment secretary, Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga, who led the aerial surveillance of the oil spill in Naujan on Friday, said in a statement: \u201cAt this point, what is important is to determine the extent and contain the spread of the oil. Secondly, hasten the cleanup to prevent further impacts of the coastal and marine biodiversity especially as well on the livelihoods of the local communities.\u201d",

When energy prices are higher than an undisclosed maximum, the spoils will be shared between the energy companies and the NSW government.Record renewables help bring down Australia\u2019s energy prices and emissionsRead moreThere were winning bids of less than $35 a megawatt hour for two solar farms and less than $50 a megawatt hour for a windfarm, the auction organiser, Aemo Services, said. These prices are perhaps the lowest for such auctions ever seen in Australia.\u201cThe transition to clean renewable energy in NSW is essential and under way,\u201d said the NSW energy minister, Penny Sharpe.\u201cThis tender has shown how much demand there is to invest in NSW to build renewable energy and it is very welcome that this investment will also support 3,300 jobs over the next 10 years.\u201dThe first tender locks in 1.4 gigawatts of new clean energy generation, bringing the total committed so far to 4.1 gigawatts as part of the former Coalition government\u2019s 12 gigawatt target by 2030. This will go some way to replacing the coal-fired power stations dropping out of the market, such as AGL\u2019s Liddell power plant did last week.The new Labor state government has made public its concerns that the looming exit of Origin\u2019s Eraring power station \u2013 the nation\u2019s largest \u2013 in 2025 could leave the market short of supply in periods of high demand.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe tender also included long-duration renewable energy storage. The winning bidder, RNE Renewables, offered a battery that would supply 50 megawatts for at least eight hours (400 megawatt hours). AEMO Services did not provide the winning bid\u2019s price.Three of the four winning bids were for projects in NSW\u2019s special renewable energy zones, including ACEN Australia\u2019s 720 megawatt solar farm planned for New England and a 400 megawatt solar farm earmarked for the central-west Orana zone, also by ACEN. The battery is in the south-west zone.Goldwind Australia also won for its 275 megawatt Coppabella windfarm in the southern tablelands.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Rishi Sunak\u2019s government will use next week\u2019s king\u2019s speech to advance expansion of North Sea oil and gas exploration, as well as pro-car policies, in the hope of opening up a clear divide over the green agenda with Labour, the Observer understands.Energy industry sources and senior figures in Whitehall say they expect ministers to announce legislation to usher in a new annual system for awarding oil and gas licences, despite the UK\u2019s commitments to move away from fossil fuels and reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.The king\u2019s speech, the final legislative programme before the next general election, is also expected to include measures that will explicitly favour motorists, including making it more difficult for local authorities to introduce 20mph speed limits or supposedly unpopular schemes such as the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), recently expanded in London.Laws to bring in tougher sentencing for serious crimes including rape, and moves to allow the government to rent prison space abroad to ease the current problems of overcrowding are also expected.With his party lagging way behind Labour in the polls, Sunak announced a major U-turn on green policy in September, postponing the deadline for selling new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing out of gas boilers, prompting fury from the car and energy industries. He hoped to win over voters worried that green policies would add to the cost of living.But since relaunching his premiership and axing the Birmingham to Manchester leg of HS2, the Tories have made no progress. In today\u2019s Opinium poll for the Observer, they remain 15 points adrift of Keir Starmer\u2019s party.Despite this, Whitehall insiders and the energy industry say there are now clear signs that Sunak intends to double down in the hope that he can create \u201cwedge issues\u201d with Labour.Labour suspects the king\u2019s speech will be packed full of bills that will be there almost entirely for political reasons. One senior opposition figure said: \u201cMany of these are not bills that are even necessary, nor does the government think they will ever come on to the statute book. They will be there because they want to be able to ask us: do you dare oppose this or not?\u201dEnvironmental campaigners point out that more oil and gas exploration licences are not only irresponsible, given the climate crisis, but that new laws are not needed to award more licences. This has been shown by the fact that the results of a new round of licences, launched just over a year ago during Liz Truss\u2019s brief stint as PM, are due to be announced imminently.Climate crisis protesters in London earlier this year. Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/ShutterstockThe government argues that awarding more licences will enhance the UK\u2019s energy security and reduce dependence on higher-emission imports, while protecting more than 200,000 jobs in a vital industry.But the plans have been cast into doubt by new analysis that shows that 13 years of North Sea licensing under the Tories has led to the discovery of very small amounts of gas, the equivalent of just nine weeks\u2019 worth of typical usage across the country.New data from Uplift \u2013 an NGO that supports the transition from fossil fuel production \u2013 shows that hundreds of North Sea licences have been issued in six rounds since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. However, this has led to the discovery of only five new oil and gas fields and enabled a further seven previously discovered fields to be developed.These 12 new fields contain just nine weeks of gas, but only half have begun producing. To date, just 16 days worth of gas has been produced from them since 2010. And half of this has been produced by the Sillimanite gas field, which is 30%-owned by Russian gas giant Gazprom, and has been exported to the Netherlands.After five decades of drilling, the North Sea\u2019s dwindling reserves, which are largely (70%) oil, mean significant new discoveries are unlikely.Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, said: \u201cOver the past 13 years under this government, new licences \u2013 hundreds of them \u2013 have led to a couple of months\u2019 worth of new gas being discovered, and only just over a fortnight\u2019s worth actually being produced.\u201cThe Conservatives are selling us a pipe dream when they need to be straight with people about how we\u2019re going to power this country. Rather than coming up with a coherent plan for ensuring we have a secure and, crucially, affordable power supply, they\u2019re trying to score political points.\u201cAn estimated 6 million households in this country now can\u2019t afford to heat their homes in winter, and bills are likely to stay high for the rest of the decade. Does this government care, or is it more concerned with playing political games with energy policy?\u201d",

There is currently no cure for the disease, which in parts of the US has been found in a quarter of hives, requiring beekeepers to destroy and burn any infected colonies and administer antibiotics to prevent further spread.\u201cIt\u2019s something that beekeepers can easily recognize because it reduces the larvae to this brown goo that has a rancid stink to it,\u201d said Keith Delaplane, an entomologist at the University of Georgia, which has partnered with Dalan for the vaccine\u2019s development.The vaccine works by incorporating some of the bacteria into the royal jelly fed by worker bees to the queen, which then ingests it and gains some of the vaccine in the ovaries. The developing bee larvae then have immunity to foulbrood as they hatch, with studies by Dalan suggesting this will reduce death rates from the disease.\u201cIn a perfect scenario, the queens could be fed a cocktail within a queen candy \u2013 the soft, pasty sugar that queen bees eat while in transit,\u201d Delaplane said. \u201cQueen breeders could advertise \u2018fully vaccinated queens.\u2019\u201dAmerican foulbrood originated in the US, and has since spread around the world. Dalan said the breakthrough could be used to find vaccines for other bee-related diseases, such as the European version of foulbrood.As they have been commercialized, transported and pressed into agricultural service, honeybees have been exposed to a cocktail of different diseases that typically lay waste to large numbers of colonies and require major interventions by beekeepers to keep numbers up.The US is unusually dependent upon managed honeybee colonies to prop up its food pollination, with hives routinely trucked across the country to propagate everything from almonds to blueberries.This is because many wild bee species are in alarming decline, due to habitat loss, pesticide use and the climate crisis, fueling concerns around a global crisis in insect numbers that threatens ecosystems and human food security and health. This article was amended on 4 January 2023 to say American foulbrood has spread worldwide. An earlier version stated it was found only in the US and Canada.",

By 2021, Belgium had cut its emissions by just 24%.The court rejected arguments that Belgium\u2019s impact on the climate crisis was limited by its small size and found its climate governance to date had violated human rights.Zakia Khattabi, the Federal climate minister, said in a post on X that the judgment \u2013 together with the European Commission\u2019s expected response to Belgium\u2019s national climate and energy plan \u2013 \u201cconstitute levers to strengthen and give credibility to our climate policies\u201d.The court case, which was brought by the nonprofit Klimaatzaak on behalf of more than 58,000 claimants, has dragged on for years through Belgium\u2019s legal system. The ruling builds on a previous verdict that found Belgium\u2019s climate policy inadequate by ordering the government to cut emissions faster.The governments will now have to set a 2030 target of at least 55%, a level of ambition greater than its current obligations of 47% under EU effort-sharing rules.Scientists warn that the new target will still not be enough to keep extreme weather from rapidly growing more violent. An analysis from the Grantham Institute in March found that Belgium would have to cut emissions at least 61% by 2030 to keep the planet from heating 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures, the level for which world leaders have promised to aim. If the right to pollute were to be shared out more equally between everyone on the planet, Belgium\u2019s cuts would have to be even deeper, reaching 81% by 2030.Speaking to the Guardian last month, Khattabi said she knew that the science called for even faster action. \u201cI know that, and I\u2019m convinced of that, but I work on a political reality. And I will be happy if we achieve our goal of 55%.\u201d\u201cBecause of our institutional architecture, it\u2019s difficult to have a national [climate] law,\u201d said Khattabi. \u201cMost environmental and climate policy is in the hands of the regions. The measures that we can take are to facilitate the work of the regions.\u201dWorld leaders are meeting in Dubai for the Cop28 summit to thrash out agreements on stopping climate change, adapting to its effects and paying for the damage it causes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "ExxonMobil executives privately sought to undermine climate science even after the oil and gas giant publicly acknowledged the link between fossil fuel emissions and climate change, according to previously unreported documents revealed by the Wall Street Journal.The new revelations are based on previously unreported documents subpoenaed by New York\u2019s attorney general as part of an investigation into the company announced in 2015. They add to a slew of documents that record a decades-long misinformation campaign waged by Exxon, which are cited in a growing number of state and municipal lawsuits against big oil.Many of the newly released documents date back to the 2006-16 tenure of former chief executive Rex Tillerson, who oversaw a major shift in the company\u2019s climate messaging. In 2006, Exxon publicly accepted that the climate crisis posed risks, and it went on to support the Paris agreement. Yet behind closed doors, the company behaved differently, the documents show.In 2008, Exxon pledged to stop funding climate-denier groups. But that very same year, company leadership said it would support the company in directing a scientist to help the nation\u2019s top oil and gas lobbying group write a paper about the \u201cuncertainty\u201d of measuring greenhouse gas emissions.New fossil fuel projects \u2018very unwise economic risk\u2019 says global energy chiefRead moreThe company\u2019s preoccupation with climate uncertainty continued. Before one meeting with company scientists in 2012, one researcher expressed an interest in finding \u201c\u2018skeptic\u2019 arguments that we consider to be not yet disproven\u201d. During a board meeting about climate science and policy that same year, the Exxon board member Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, who is the former chief executive of Nestl\u00e9, said there was \u201cstill uncertainty in predicting future climate changes and impacts\u201d and also said that \u201cmoney and effort spent on climate change is misplaced\u201d.The documents also show Exxon\u2019s displeasure with scientific warnings from top authorities. After the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations\u2019 top climate body, sounded the alarm about the urgent need to curb greenhouse-gas emissions in 2011, Tillerson told a leading Exxon researcher that the IPCC\u2019s warning was \u201cnot credible\u201d, and said he was \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the media\u2019s coverage of the warning about the worst-case climate scenarios.Tillerson also wanted to engage with the scientists \u201cto influence [the group], in addition to gathering info\u201d, the Exxon researcher told colleagues in a 2012 email about the findings.Years later, Tillerson expressed doubt about the United Nations\u2019 Paris accord months before it was signed. The international agreement aims to keep global heating \u201cwell below\u201d 2C over pre-industrial temperatures.After a climate science presentation to Exxon\u2019s board of directors in April 2015, Tillerson called the 2C goal \u201csomething magical\u201d, according to a summary of the meeting.\u201cWho is to say 2.5 is not good enough?\u201d he said, noting that meeting such targets would be \u201cvery expensive\u201d.That December, Exxon publicly endorsed the Paris agreement; during his Senate confirmation hearing to become secretary of state in 2017 under President Trump, Tillerson maintained his support for it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "The potential collapse of Thames Water, sinking under \u00a314bn of debt, is just the latest evidence that the regulatory regimes that oversee large parts of the British economy are failing.It comes on the heels of Ofgem, the gas and electricity regulator, failing to notice that companies supplying power to consumers were undercapitalised and vulnerable to global price volatility. The rail regulator, Office of Rail Regulation (ORR), has failed to protect the users of northern rail services or of commuter services around London from the incompetence of franchise operators. Ofcom, once the most respected regulator, has failed to prevent egregious telecom double-digit price increases \u2013 one of the worst recent examples of corporate exploitation which has helped to push up the cost of living.Consumers or taxpayers or both will have to pay the cost of these failures. Ofwat\u2019s failure to control financial engineering has left a number of other water companies in serious debt. Ofgem\u2019s inability to ensure that the companies it was regulating could cope with volatile prices will add billions to retail bills.What are the options for Thames Water as crisis talks continue?Read moreIn the 1980s heyday of privatisation, regulators were presented as the key protectors of consumer interest in areas where private companies were taking on the ownership of natural monopolies. Over the past decade that role has been diminished. The ideological approach of successive governments has been that the private sector can be trusted to manage itself, and that undue regulatory interference would deter much-needed investment.Many companies in the water, energy and other utility sectors are competent, are fully aware of their social and environmental responsibilities and do not exploit their consumers or use financial engineering to benefit their shareholders. But a minority do not operate in the public interest, and that is where strong and clear regulation is essential.Energy and water supply businesses need investment, and unless they are all to be taken back into public ownership, private investors such as pension funds will need a return. But with a protected market position, returns should be set at an appropriate and limited level. For many institutional investors, relatively secure, if modest, returns are perfectly adequate. Utilities should not be in the business of short-term profit maximisation, and their pay and bonus structures should reward the delivery of promised service provision.Ownership structures should not only benefit shareholders. There is much to be said for the development of utility businesses that follow the model of Welsh Water \u2013 D\u0175r Cymru \u2013 a company limited by guarantee with no shareholders, and whose returns are therefore used to improve service provision for the benefits of its consumers.Retail bills should be set to cover operating costs, including the costs of maintaining and upgrading infrastructure and protecting the environment. Long-term investment has been neglected under government pressure to keep bills down. This is a dangerously false economy leading to neglect and decay, and in the case of the water industry to the continued dumping of untreated sewage.If we want good-quality water, reliable trains and secure energy supplies, we will have to pay for them. Good regulators have a responsibility to make the choices clear, and to ensure that all the companies engaged in the provision of basic services meet the standards expected.Mobile and broadband firms accused of fuelling UK \u2018greedflation\u2019 with major price hikesRead moreThe regulatory system is essential and it needs to be rebuilt. In each case, the remit of the regulator must be set and accompanied by sufficient powers to ensure compliance. The revolving door between the regulators and the companies they are employed to control must be closed.A reformed model would allow regulators to be independent, and their remit would include a guarantee of independence from the day-to-day temptation for ministers to interfere in detailed decision making. In turn, they would give expert advice to government about how key objectives could be met and their leadership would be politically impartial.The neglect of the past decade is coming back to haunt the regulators. With the prospect of a sustained period of high interest rates, more problems are likely in companies whose activities are so essential to daily life that they cannot be allowed to collapse. The problems at Thames Water came as a surprise to some observers, including it seems ministers, but to those who have followed the water sector closely, it was no surprise at all. Thames Water will not be the last victim of regulatory failure.

Plainly they could have been struck by fast-moving vehicles with obvious severe consequences,\u201d said the prosecutor Simon Jones. \u201cWe say that their actions also caused risk to the drivers themselves and the marshals.\u201dAll six defendants gave evidence denying the charges, with McKechnie saying the protest was planned \u201cto be as safe as possible\u201d and he had \u201cwatched every single race that\u2019s been held at Silverstone over the last 20 years\u201d as part of his research.\u201cI scoured the internet for every piece of information I could get about the track, the red flag system and also the drivers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe picked a part of the track which would give the cars plenty of time to pass where we were and where the racing line was on the far side of the track.\u201dHe said the group had carried out \u201cmeticulous\u201d planning over two and a half months, and had planned to enter the track only when a red flag was raised. \u201cWe used that understanding to plan it [the protest] to be as safe as possible,\u201d he said.They ran on to the Wellington Straight after a multi-car crash on the first lap led to a red flag being raised, meaning drivers must significantly reduce their speed and return to the pit lane. \u201cI knew I was safe and secure where I was on the track.

        "text": "Air pollution is making it harder for fruit flies to mate because females cannot easily recognise a male\u2019s scent, a study has found.Female fruit flies select their mates for reproduction through the scent of their pheromones, but ozone pollution can disrupt the male\u2019s ability to emit their characteristic odour, researchers have found. This means contaminated air can pose a threat to how successfully fruit flies and other insects reproduce, and could lead to population decline.\u201cEveryone knows that we are facing insect decline, and so far the reason was pesticide use and habitat loss. But we think that we should also consider oxygen pollutants,\u201d said Markus Knaden, a researcher of evolutionary neuroethology at the Max Planck Institute and lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Communications.This study builds on research into how insects perceive flower odours differently when exposed to elevated levels of ozone. Knaden\u2019s team tested nine different species of Drosophila fruit flies by exposing half the males from each species to ambient air, and half to an atmosphere with ozone levels at 100 parts per billion. Average industrial ozone levels are at roughly 40 parts per billion, but regions like India, China or Mexico experience magnitudes as high as 210 parts per billion.The scientists found the males exposed to higher ozone levels started emitting fewer pheromones. As a result, they had trouble attracting female partners. \u201cWhen we expose male flies to ozone, then suddenly it took them much longer to convince the female to mate,\u201d said Knaden.What\u2019s more, emitting pheromones also helps males fend off other males from trying to reproduce with them. But being exposed to ozone led to males smelling less like males, and a rise in the number of attempts to mate between males, Knaden said.\u201cIn the lab, it doesn\u2019t matter whether the male has to wait one or two minutes longer to mate, or whether the male accidentally courts another male,\u201d says Knaden. \u201cBut in the field there is a lot of selection pressure and the flies have to be efficient, so they have to give everything to find the female as soon as possible, copulate and fertilise her eggs before they\u2019re killed by a predator.\u201dInsect pheromones are based on chains of molecules latched together by two carbon molecules, but ozone has the ability to break up these carbon bonds and dissolve the pheromone strings. The effect in nature is likely to be amplified, Knaden said, as ozone is just one of many pollutants in the environment with the ability to do this.\u201cI think it\u2019s really one of these things where, yeah, we should have thought of this earlier,\u201d said Jean-Christophe Billeter, a professor at the University of Groningen who studies fruit fly pheromones but was not involved in this work. \u201cA very, very common environmental pollutant can have a very specific effect on reproduction.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

What fruit flies are experiencing could be happening for several other insects too, Billeter added, including moths, ants, or pollinators like bees, who not only mate but also communicate and coordinate their colonies and nests with unique pheromone signatures.",

Cocoa, its most important ingredient, is produced from the seed of the tropical Theobroma cacao tree. It is native to South America, but most is now produced in Africa, with Ivory Coast and Ghana accounting for two-thirds of production.An estimated 2 million farmers in west Africa, operating farms of an average of just three to four hectares each, rely on cocoa for their income \u2013 usually less than $1 a day. They supply a complex network of middlemen, including public and private companies, who connect them to the world market, making the supply chain opaque.This obscurity has made cocoa production a haven for human rights abuses, and chocolate has long been linked to slavery. But the latest research also links the indulgent snack to the climate and biodiversity crises that risk the catastrophic breakdown of the planet\u2019s biosphere.Like tropical regions, west Africa is rapidly losing its forests. Ivory Coast is estimated to have lost more than 90% since 1950, while Ghana is thought to have lost at least 65%. Cocoa production had been identified as one of the main causes of deforestation in both countries, alongside mining, selective logging and other agriculture, but the extent to which it bore responsibility was not certain.An international team of researchers set out to accurately map the extent of cocoa cultivation in deforested areas using satellite imagery. They trained a neural network to scour the satellite imagery and identify cocoa plantations, double-checked their findings with teams on the ground in Ivory Coast and Ghana, then cross referenced them against areas mapped on the World Database of Protected Areas.In total, the researchers found, cocoa was being grown on more than 1.5m hectares of protected areas across the two countries, including nearly 14% of Ivory Coast\u2019s protected areas and 5% of Ghana\u2019s. In some classified forest or forest reserve areas, close to four-fifths of land had been cleared to grow cocoa.\u201cThe single most significant driver of deforestation in cocoa production is poverty,\u201d said Kwame Osei, the country director for Ghana and Nigeria for the Rainforest Alliance, which was not involved in the research. \u201cCocoa farmers in west Africa receive a mere 6% of a chocolate bar\u2019s retail price. They are on the losing end of the supply chain, too, bearing the brunt of chronically low prices and with few opportunities to negotiate.\u201cCocoa farmers are also on the front lines of the climate crisis, which leaves them vulnerable to drought, pests, and diseases that can decimate a harvest. In turn, land degradation often leads to the transformation of forest areas, including protected areas, into new cocoa plantations.\u201d",

When they shrink, glaciers release larger amounts of freshwater into the sea which can disrupt the currents of the Southern Ocean.Dr Benjamin Davison, an expert in Earth observation and the study\u2019s lead, said: \u201cThere is a mixed picture of ice-shelf deterioration, and this is to do with the ocean temperature and ocean currents around Antarctica.\u201cThe western half is exposed to warm water, which can rapidly erode the ice shelves from below, whereas much of east Antarctica is currently protected from nearby warm water by a band of cold water at the coast.\u201dScientists measured year-by-year changes to the ice using satellites that can see through the thick cloud during long polar nights.Researchers looked at more than 100,000 images taken from space to analyse the health of the ice shelves, which can have knock-on effects for the rest of the globe, and published their findings in the journal Scientific Advances.The estimated 67tn tonnes of freshwater released into the ocean over the 25-year period affects the ocean currents that transport heat and nutrients around the world.Scientists believe the ice loss is a result of the climate crisis because there would be more ice regrowing if it was part of a cycle of natural variation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But that pledge has so far gone unmet, with only $83bn provided in 2020.Estimates suggest that the $100bn figure should be exceeded this year, but Oxfam said standard estimates overstated the true amounts. That is because some of the money has been taken from existing overseas aid budgets, and some of what is counted as climate finance includes funds primarily allocated to development projects such as health and education, with only tangential benefits to the climate.Oxfam also argues that finance should be provided in the form of grants rather than loans, though some donor countries defend the use of loans.If all of these sums are stripped out, then only $21bn to $24.5bn of the $83bn remains as pure climate finance without strings attached, according to Oxfam in its Climate Finance Shadow Report 2023, published on Monday.Climate finance will come under close scrutiny this week, at UN negotiations to be held in Bonn, ahead of the Cop28 climate summit that starts on 30 November.This year\u2019s summit \u2013 Cop stands for \u201cconference of the parties\u201d under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change \u2013 will be hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a major oil-producing country that plans to expand its fossil fuel production capacity.Sultan Al Jaber, president-designate of Cop28, is also head of UAE\u2019s national oil company, Adnoc, a dual role that many campaigners have warned represents a conflict of interests.Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and twice a climate envoy for the UN, led a group of prominent women in writing to the UN at the weekend, asking for a clear \u201cfirewall\u201d to be set up between the Cop preparations and UAE\u2019s oil industry.\u201cSo far, UAE hasn\u2019t shown signs of prioritising action to address the impact of climate change on vulnerable people, especially women,\u201d they wrote. \u201cSome are saying that the talks are heading for a car crash \u2013 instead of leading to address the emergency for people, climate and nature, we are also facing an emergency for the survival of the UN multilateral system and democracy.\u201dAt this week\u2019s preparatory meeting, governments will discuss how to set up a fund to help poor countries with loss and damage, which means the ravages of climate breakdown that are too severe for countries to adapt to them.

Is it ever justifiable for non-violent defendants to be held in prison \u2013 some for many months \u2013 before their cases even make it to court? What is the cost of all of this, from the public money being spent on trials and imprisonment to the huge toll that incarceration and prosecution take on alleged criminals?Can we imagine an alternative where the resources being used to suppress protest movements were instead leveraged against a very different brand of offender: those in a powerful minority who exploit and deceive to profit from exacerbating the very crises that activists are being restricted from even mentioning in their defence?Dr Abi Perrin York Six weeks ago, aged 59, I became a convicted criminal. My crime? I helped blockade a printing plant to stop the nation\u2019s billionaire-owned newspapers reaching the shops, to protest against their 30-year campaign of disinformation to delay action on the accelerating climate crisis.It was an action I never wanted to take. At 10, I published a weekly newspaper from my garden shed and dreamed of writing for the real thing. As an adult, I spent 20 years writing for the very newspapers I was protesting against. But like every other climate activist who finds themselves in front of this country\u2019s courts, I was listening to my conscience and acting on it.As George Monbiot pointed out, the worst nightmares of the powerful are coming true: judges and juries are accepting that people like me don\u2019t damage property or block roads in some kind of anarchist frenzy. We do it in love and desperation as the only effective avenue left to demand government acts to save billions of lives.The government\u2019s response so far \u2013 supported by Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour \u2013 is to grant itself terrifying new powers to shoot the messengers. But politicians are like the little boy with his finger in the crumbling dyke \u2013 because the message is cutting through. Thousands more are joining movements like Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion every week.I wonder how many people are staring at supermarket shelves empty of fruit and vegetables due to \u201cadverse weather conditions\u201d this week, joining the dots and resolving to do something about it?It\u2019s time for politicians and the media to ask themselves whether they want to ride the wave of fear and anger that\u2019s coming \u2013 or be broken by it.Steve ToozeLondon We hosted one of these \u201ccriminals\u201d, who stayed with us for one week in early February during her trial alongside David Nixon, whose case was discussed by George Monbiot. They were all told quite clearly by the judge that they could offer no defence or they would be held in contempt of court \u2013 which, of course, David was when he could no longer tolerate the gagging rule.What kind of a court is this where the defendants cannot state the motives for their actions? Their defence would have involved language about beliefs and climate that were all forbidden. So why waste so much time, resources and energy on these trials involving a new jury week after week if they are all to be found guilty \u2013 as this is the inevitable outcome?How many months will they go on in this farcical way, prosecuting committed climate activists who will not be swayed from their dedication to exposing our climate emergency? Surely the matter could be dealt with more efficiently in a magistrates court instead of this total waste of people\u2019s time and taxpayers\u2019 money. The emergency is really what matters, not trying to silence protest in show trials. Our government needs to address this matter with the kind of dedication these activists show.Sue DaviesLondon",

But when they arrived to the forest in Quatsino Sound, they found hundreds of trees that has recently been logged.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely gut-wrenching to see a tree lying on the ground, and to think that it had lived for more than 500 years and then it can be gone in the blink of an eye, never to be seen again,\u201d said Watt, who photographed the forest as part of a grant from the Trebek Initiative, a partnership between the National Geographic Society and the Royal Canadian Geographical Society named after the late Jeopardy host.The trees were downed in a grove in Quatsino Sound on Vancouver Island. Photograph: TJ WattWatt\u2019s images have been used previously to highlight the dramatic change to landscapes after an old-growth forest is cleared.In November 2021, amid mounting public frustration over the destruction of old-growth trees, the British Columbia government deferred logging in 2.6m hectares within the most at-risk forests. The BC government has also pledged to protect 30% of the province\u2019s land area by 2030, part of broader efforts within Canada to meet biodiversity preservation goals.Since outlining its planned deferrals, however, less than half of the proposed areas have been agreed upon by the province and First Nations communities, whose consent is required. A number of First Nations are actively involved in the logging industry and would see a drop in revenues if logging in their territory was halted. Groups such as the Ancient Forest Alliance say more funding is needed to help offset lost forestry revenues among First Nations.\u2018There\u2019s no argument that can be made, when you see these trees that are centuries old, that they should be cut down.\u2019 Photograph: TJ WattCritics of the province\u2019s deferral plans also say there are problems in the original recommendations, including an admission from the technical advisory panel that a number of forests are likely to have been incorrectly classified. In the case of the cutblock found by Watt and Thomas, held by Western Forest Products and logged in late 2022, it was classified as 210 years, younger than the province\u2019s 250-year-old threshold for being considered old-growth. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u201cIt just underscores the fact that the logging industry is racing to cut the biggest and best trees while they still can,\u201d said Watt. \u201cTree-planting does not replicate a complex old-growth forest ecosystem. Knowing this forest could potentially have been left standing, had it been identified properly by the province, is also another punch to the gut.\u201dCurrently, there are no mechanisms in place for the public or industry to flag forests with trees older than those the province has identified.\u201cThe province admitted the data was going to be somewhat imperfect. We\u2019ve said that citizens and scientists should be able to identify and point out areas missed for deferral. Logging companies should be required when they\u2019re doing their planning and surveys to compare it to that criteria,\u201d said Watt.Drone footage and photos of the chopped-down trees. Photograph: TJ WattTimber companies are not obliged to cut down all trees within an approved cutblock. In 2011, logger Dennis Cronin memorably stumbled upon a towering Douglas fir, probably more than 1,000 years old, on the west coast of Vancouver Island. The rest of the forest was logged, but Big Lonely Doug was spared.\u201cProgress is being made, but clearly there are still loopholes. We need to make sure that the province is following through on all of their commitments to protect these endangered ecosystems, and not letting anything slip through the cracks,\u201d said Watt.\u201cThere\u2019s no argument that can be made, when you see these trees that are centuries old, that they should be cut down.\u201d",

        "text": "In the past week almost 120 global leaders have pledged to triple the world\u2019s renewable energy capacity before 2030 in a bold attempt to slash the global consumption of fossil fuels.As the second half of the Cop28 UN climate conference in Dubai unfolds in the week ahead, more countries may join the calls for a global target of 11 terawatts (TW) of renewable power by the end of the decade, three times higher than the 3.629TW in place at the end of 2022.Tripling the world\u2019s renewables by 2030 is an \u201cambitious yet achievable goal\u201d, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Based on the rate of growth for wind and solar power in recent years, the world is on track to meet this target.But the global energy watchdog has warned that \u201cstronger policy actions by governments\u201d will be required to surmount the obstacles that threaten to slow the progress of wind and solar power developers. Overcoming challenges, such as rising costs, uncertain supply chains and grid bottlenecks, is considered essential for leaders struggling to hit their goal of limiting global heating to within 1.5C of pre-industrialised levels.Tripling the world\u2019s renewables would halve the global demand for coal power by 2030, according to estimates, which would deliver almost half the reductions in methane \u2013 a potent greenhouse gas \u2013 needed from the coalmining sector this decade.\u201cThis is crucial for 1.5C,\u201d said Dave Jones, the global insights lead for climate thinktank Ember. \u201cThe tripling goal would take renewables to the next level, with solar and wind reaching 40% of global electricity generation by 2030. Together, these would unlock deep economy-wide fossil fuel reductions and ensure that oil, coal and gas demand not only peak this decade but see a meaningful fall.\u201dThe goal has won the support of 118 countries, which could pave the way for a historic opportunity to cement the ambition in the Cop28 final text. In practice, not every country would be increasing its renewable capacity threefold to hit the global target. Some countries starting from a lower level would need to more than triple their wind and solar power, while for others with a high share of renewables already, it would not be feasible to triple their capacity again.Chinese wind turbine maker Envision Energy believes meeting the international pledge by 2030 would be \u201ceasy\u201d. \u201cThis is not visionary,\u201d its chief executive, Lei Zhang, told journalists at the Dubai summit. \u201cIf you look at the wind and solar growth rate in the past, you see triple is not difficult because all renewables have been lower cost than fossil fuel.\u201dIncreasing capacity may have been simple in recent years with the help of low interest rates and generous government support schemes, but the sector\u2019s progress for the rest of the decade is less certain. Rising inflation and the disruption to the global offshore wind supply chains has taken a toll on the biggest offshore wind developers in the last year by raising costs by over 40% in some cases. Higher interest rates have pushed up the cost of financing.More than 90 gigawatts of wind capacity was installed globally across 55 markets in 2022, 14% less than in 2021, according to data from S&P Global. The figures show that global offshore installations more than halved to 9GW in 2022, driven by steep declines in mainland China and the UK.The future growth of solar power looks relatively assured as global manufacturing capacity is set to reach 1TW a year in 2024, according to the IEA. Still, solar power projects are expected to face a more difficult time connecting to power grids, which require a dramatic rewiring to cope with the extra demand.Fatih Birol, head of the IEA, has urged governments to \u201copen their eyes\u201d to the scale of the task facing them. Advanced economies will need to lay at least 23m km of power lines by 2040 to meet their renewable energy goals, the IEA says, and on a global level, 80m km of cable will be needed.So far China and India, two of the world\u2019s biggest polluters, have not backed the pledge despite setting ambitious renewables agendas of their own. India is aiming to triple its renewable capacity by 2030, said Ember. It found that China was responsible for two-thirds of global growth in solar and wind in the first half of 2023, while official forecasts predict the country will double its renewable capacity by 2030.",

        "text": "Cheers, tears and people (almost) dancing in the aisles: the joyful scenes that greeted the gavel coming down on the Paris climate agreement in 2015 were such that no one who was there will ever forget the feeling. After more than two decades of tortuous talks under the UN, the world finally had a global treaty compelling governments to act on the climate crisis.That it all came together, on a Saturday night in a former airfield on the outskirts of Paris, was a testament to the hard work put in by a small cadre of climate negotiators. While world leaders and politicians took the credit in front of the cameras, the bureaucrats trudged off to their hotels to get some sleep.Peter Betts, who has died of a brain tumour aged 64, was one of those key civil servants who helped draft the Paris agreement and shepherd it to safety. A veteran of the British climate team, he acted as chief negotiator for the EU \u2013 the main force behind the Paris agreement, for all that the US and China stole the headlines.A trim figure in short-sleeved white shirts, he was an old-fashioned civil servant, of the sort schooled in the need to speak truth to power, but to do so courteously, with impartial advice, while recognising that the elected politicians make the decisions. He spent 35 years in the civil service, retiring a few years after Paris, in 2018, though returning briefly to an advisory role on the UK\u2019s hosting of Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021.Betts was born in Battersea, south-west London, to George, a member of the Salvage Corps, part of the Fire Brigade, and Joyce (nee Pedder), a welfare worker.He attended Emanuel grammar school and then went to Mansfield College, Oxford, to study history.After graduating in 1982, he worked through a series of odd jobs \u2013 including a brief stint on the East End News (1982-83) \u2013 before moving into the civil service in 1984. Fast-tracked from the outset at the Department of the Environment, he got a posting to Brussels for three years from 1994.His move to the UK\u2019s climate team came in 2008, when he took the title of director of international climate change at Defra (the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs). Later that year climate change was moved to the newly created Decc (Department of Energy and Climate Change), and from 2016 it came under BEIS (Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy).Betts viewed the Paris agreement as the crowning achievement of his career. Throughout a fortnight of tense talks, success had never been certain. Countries baulked at commitments they had previously signalled assent to, some schemed to water down the stipulations, others resurrected old controversies.Hours were spent by Betts and his colleagues over phrases to be placed in square brackets, on the placement of semi-colons, footnotes and the substitution of verbs.On that snowy Saturday, those of us allowed into the hall were told that an agreement was imminent. But after nearly two hours, it was clear something was wrong. It seemed that it could fall at the last hurdle.As we later found out, what had happened was that in the draft of the 27-page document presented to governments, one clause had been transposed as a \u201cshall\u201d instead of a \u201cshould\u201d. The mistake was rectified, new documents were printed and the deal was signed. But the incident demonstrated the importance of vital tiny details.After leaving the civil service, Betts took on several advisory and academic roles, including at the Chatham House thinktank.He met Fiona McGregor, now chief executive at Regulator of Social Housing, in 1990; they married in 2006. She survives him, as do his parents and a sister, Susan.",

We caught a live crab in a rock pool on the first day of a summer holiday, and watched her for hours: she was a swimmer crab and her back legs were furry paddles. They were strangely poignant, as though this was a crab who had given up something hard for something softer, like hands, or paws.A crab\u2019s complicated face, like an intricate chest of drawers, or a jewellery box: press on this part and it opens to reveal a mouth, on that, and an eye pops out on its stalk. Every bit of its armour seems as though it is a container for a precious object \u2013 which, of course, it is.Every crab makes an impression. William James, Henry James\u2019s older brother, was a psychologist and philosopher. When he set out to study people\u2019s individual relationships with religion and mysticism, in lectures that eventually became a book called The Varieties of Religious Experience, he anticipated criticism:\nThe first thing the intellect does with an object is to class it with something else. But any object that is infinitely important to us and awakens our devotion feels to us as if it must have been sui generis and unique. Probably a crab would be filled with a sense of personal outrage if it could hear us class it without ado or apology as a crustacean, and thus dispose of it. \u2018I am no such thing,\u2019 it would say, \u2018I am MYSELF, MYSELF alone.\u2019\nWatching crabs \u201cclicking out past themselves\u201d, as Dennis Saleh put it, you know they are saying only this: I am MYSELF, MYSELF alone.

Research indicates that this could help absorb carbon from the atmosphere and ensure sustainable food production.The new law would see member states monitor the health of soils, fertiliser use and erosion, but stops short of country-level targets for improving soil quality. This drew criticism from the European agri-food industry, which called for more ambition to improve the \u201cworrying\u201d state of soils.Speaking to the Guardian, the EU environment commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius, said the ultimate aim was for the continent to have healthy soils by 2050. More than 60% of the EU\u2019s soils are considered to be in an unhealthy state.\u201cIf our soils continue to degrade, the biggest risk is to our food security and farmers.

Its adjusted earnings hit $36bn and it said it would buy back a further $2bn of its own shares.The pair become the latest oil and gas giant to report record profits aided by soaring gas prices linked to the war in Ukraine, after similar results from Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP.Equinor supplies about a quarter of Britain\u2019s gas and hopes to develop the Rosebank field, to the west of Shetland despite vociferous opposition from climate protesters. A final investment decision on the UK\u2019s largest undeveloped oilfield is expected this year.Equinor raised its quarterly dividend and said it expects to hand $17bn to shareholders in 2023.Greenpeace UK\u2019s head of climate, Mel Evans, said: \u201cEquinor is the latest fossil fuel giant to post record profits looted from bill payers\u2019 pockets while destroying the climate last year.\u201cDependence on oil and gas is pushing our bills up.

An investment allowance within the levy allows companies to reduce their tax bill if they spend on new production.Tessa Khan, the executive director of the climate action organisation Uplift, said: \u201cGrant Shapps needs to use his first day in office to push for the scrapping of this huge loophole in the windfall tax, which will see a total of \u00a311bn in public subsidies handed to profiteers like Equinor.\u201cDays two and three need to be focused on ramping up cheaper, homegrown renewables and unlocking the funds to upgrade the UK\u2019s draughty homes, so that we can be free from oil and gas \u2013 and this kind of shameless profiteering \u2013 for good.\u201dClimate campaigners including Stop Rosebank and the Young Christian Climate Network staged protests outside Equinor\u2019s offices in London and Aberdeen to condemn what they said was Equinor\u2019s role in \u201cboth the climate and cost of living crises\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are outraged that landowners this week including Darwall have struck a deal with the national park in which they are paid to allow camping on small portions of their land. Campaigners have called it a \u201cstitch-up\u201d.Natural England, the government body in charge of enforcing conservation measures in national parks, has warned the estate not to release pheasants near Dendles Wood, a fragment of temperate rainforest on the southern edge of Dartmoor, adjacent to the Blachford estate. It is protected as a national nature reserve (NNR) and site of special scientific interest (SSSI), and falls within the Dartmoor special area of conservation (SAC). The letter to the estate contained details on the necessary maintenance to retain these statuses, including not releasing pheasants.In a conservation plan for the wood, released under freedom of information laws, Natural England says that \u201coperations likely to damage the special interest\u201d of Dendles Wood include \u201cthe release into the site of any wild, feral or domestic animal\u201d and \u201cintroduction of and changes in game and waterfowl management and hunting practice\u201d.MP who received donation from landowner refuses to criticise Dartmoor camping decisionRead moreThe very rare blue ground beetle is put under pressure by the release of the birds, according to Natural England. The plan says \u201chigh pheasant stocking rates are a threat to this species\u201dbecause pheasants prey on the beetles.Dendles Wood is one of only a handful of sites in the UK where the large and distinctive beetle makes its home. It is found at just 15 sites in England and Wales, eight of which are in Dartmoor national park.A blue ground beetle. Photograph: Nature Photographers Ltd/AlamyDespite this, local residents have found a pheasant release pen on land owned by the Darwall family that lies less than 250 metres from the edge of the NNR. Photos show the release pen has multiple entrances and exits for pheasants, meaning they are free to enter the surrounding woods. Volunteer rangers have said that pheasants are one of the most common birds to be found in Dendles Wood.The estate also appears to be breaching the licence to release pheasants to shoot. It does not appear to have reported to Natural England the number or density of pheasants it releases near the wood, even though this is one of the conditions of the GL43 general licence under which landowners are permitted to release pheasants within 500 metres of an SAC.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Glyphosate separately has been linked to cancer and other health problems.\u2018Disturbing\u2019: weedkiller ingredient tied to cancer found in 80% of US urine samplesRead more\u201cIf the developing fetus is especially vulnerable to glyphosate, it is critical to understand the magnitude and sources of exposure during this critical developmental period,\u201d the new paper states.The authors include researchers from the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Washington; Boise State University; and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Glyphosate is the world\u2019s most widely used herbicide and is the active ingredient in products sold around the world, including the widely used Roundup brand developed by Monsanto and now owned by Bayer after Bayer\u2019s 2018 acquisition of Monsanto.The results of the study were considered somewhat surprising because none of the women studied worked with glyphosate or other herbicides or had a household member who worked with weedkillers, said Cynthia Curl, associate professor at Boise State and lead author on the paper.\u201cWhat is going on? Is it drifting more than we think? Is it adhering to soil particles which then blow around and end up in people\u2019s house dust? Is it drinking water? Until we figure that out we can\u2019t suggest the right interventions,\u201d Curl said.Curl said follow-up research will collect household dust and water samples to try to determine routes of exposure.To evaluate the exposure, the research team collected 453 urine samples biweekly from 40 pregnant women in southern Idaho from February through December 2021. Women were considered to be living near a farm field if they resided less than 0.5km, or roughly 0.3 of a mile, from an actively cultivated field.In those living near the fields, glyphosate was detected both more frequently and at much higher concentrations during the months when farmers were spraying glyphosate than during the periods when they were not spraying. Those participants living farther away still showed glyphosate in their urine, but the frequency and concentrations stayed relatively unchanged throughout the year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

And in a recent population-based survey in France, glyphosate was found in 99% of urine samples collected from close to 7,000 participants.This story is co-published with the New Lede, a journalism project of the Environmental Working Group",

Lindboe said she would consider the means by which the tree was transported by road to the cargo ship.Responding to suggestions in Norwegian media that the tradition could end, she said that while the matter was up for a vote in the city council next year \u2013 as it was every few years \u2013 she was not aware of any plans to discontinue it.Lindboe added: \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anyone in the city council saying that we should not continue.

If you\u2019re a climavore who wants to eat for the planet, but avocados are still a must, eat them less often, as a special treat, and use European-grown and organic ones whenever possible.Most importantly, though, don\u2019t waste them. Avocados labelled as \u201cready to eat\u201d cost more and are often overripe.

Sometimes, avocados just don\u2019t ripen and end up going off before they are ready to eat. The last time this happened to me, rather than dispose of the fruit, I chopped it up and added it to a Mexican stew. That led to further research and the discovery of today\u2019s dish. If you are cooking more than one avocado, you won\u2019t need to multiply the other ingredients by the same amount: just add by eye some extra flour, aquafaba (or egg), and breadcrumbs (if you don\u2019t have any stale bread or breadcrumbs, polenta makes a great alternative) \u2013 the aim is simply to coat the avocado pieces evenly.You can season the avocado with lime juice and sea salt and pepper to help maintain its colour and heighten the flavour, but it\u2019s not essential, because the fries can be seasoned afterwards. They are also delicious dressed with a squeeze of lime just before eating.Firm or under-ripe avocados work best here, but even ripe ones will work, provided they are firm enough to hold their shape.

        "text": "Alan Mazzotti can see the Rocky Mountains about 30 miles west of his pumpkin patch in north-east Colorado on a clear day. He could tell the snow was abundant last winter, and verified it up close when he floated through fresh powder alongside his wife and three sons at the popular Winter Park resort.But one season of above-average snowfall wasn\u2019t enough to refill the dwindling reservoir he relies on to irrigate his pumpkins. He received news this spring that his water delivery would be about half of what it was from the previous season, so he planted just half of his typical pumpkin crop. Then heavy rains in May and June brought plenty of water and turned fields into a muddy mess, preventing any additional planting many farmers might have wanted to do.Sam Bankman-Fried testifies for third day at FTX fraud trial after admitting \u2018large mistakes\u2019Read more\u201cBy time it started raining and the rain started to affect our reservoir supplies and everything else, it was just too late for this year,\u201d Mazzotti said.For some pumpkin growers in states such as Texas, New Mexico and Colorado, this year\u2019s pumpkin crop was a reminder of the water challenges hitting agriculture across the south-west and west as human-caused climate change exacerbates drought and heat extremes. Some farmers lost 20% or more of their predicted yields; others, like Mazzotti, left some land bare. Labor costs and inflation are also narrowing margins, hitting farmers\u2019 ability to profit off what they sell to garden centers and pumpkin patches.This year\u2019s thirsty gourds are a symbol of the reality that farmers who rely on irrigation must continue to face season after season: they have to make choices, based on water allotments and the cost of electricity to pump it out of the ground, about which acres to plant and which crops they can gamble on to make it through hotter and drier summers.Pumpkins can survive hot, dry weather to an extent, but this summer\u2019s heat, which broke world records and brought temperatures well over 100F (38C) to agricultural fields across the country, was just too much, said Mark Carroll, a Texas A&M extension agent for Floyd county, which he calls the \u201cpumpkin capital\u201d of the state.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the worst years we\u2019ve had in several years,\u201d Carroll said. Not only did the hot, dry weather surpass what irrigation could make up for, but pumpkins also need cooler weather to be harvested or they\u2019ll start to decompose during the shipping process, sometimes disintegrating before they even arrive at stores.America\u2019s pumpkin powerhouse, Illinois, had a successful harvest on par with the last two years, according to the Illinois Farm Bureau. But this year it was so hot into the harvest season in Texas that farmers had to decide whether to risk cutting pumpkins off the vines at the usual time or wait and miss the start of the fall pumpkin rush. Adding to the problem, irrigation costs more as groundwater levels continue to drop \u2013 driving some farmers\u2019 energy bills to pump water into the thousands of dollars every month.Mazzotti says that with not enough water, you \u201cmight as well not farm\u201d \u2013 but even so, he sees labor as the bigger issue. Farmers in Colorado have been dealing with water cutbacks for a long time, and they\u2019re used to it. However, pumpkins can\u2019t be harvested by machine like corn can, so they require lots of people to determine they\u2019re ripe, cut them off the vines and prepare them for shipping.He hires guest workers through the H-2A program; Colorado recently instituted a law ensuring farmworkers to be paid overtime \u2013 something most states don\u2019t require. That makes it tough to maintain competitive prices with places where laborers are paid less, and the increasing costs of irrigation and supplies stack onto that, creating what Mazzotti calls a \u201cno-win situation\u201d.",

I am walking along next to the beck with two farming officers from the national park authority. The track is covered in sheet ice, and we have to walk along the tussocky edges in order to get anywhere.Today we have an outdoor meeting about how the wood pasture \u2013 which is grazed by cows during the summer months \u2013 might benefit from more targeted habitat management. My idea is to use Nofence collars.These collars, approved by Defra, use GPS technology to create invisible \u201cfencing\u201d, drawn by the farmer on an app on their mobile phone. If a cow gets near the boundary, the collar emits a sound, then a small electric pulse (about 1-2% of the pulse of a normal livestock electric fence), warning it to move away. The cows then learn to avoid the boundary in the first place. The collar also sends the farmer an alert if a cow escapes or has not moved for a while, which can suggest it is in trouble.View image in fullscreen\u2018One of the main benefits is that I\u2019d be able to see where the cows were before I set off to check on them every day.\u2019 Photograph: Andrea MeanwellOne of the main benefits is that I\u2019d be able to see where the cows were before I set off to check on them every day, saving hours each week looking for them. It would also help keep the cows in certain areas, away from walkers and in the parts where bracken needs bashing. And it could mean that when fencing comes down it may not need to be replaced, leaving the landscape looking more natural. I\u2019m a traditional farmer, and technology comes slowly to the hills, but after some initial hesitation I can see this could be a gamechanger for us.The meeting is productive and I hope to get grant funding for the collars. As we edge our way along the valley, it\u2019s hard to imagine that soon it will be bursting with spring life. We arrive back in the farmyard; the cows hear us and call for more hay to be forked up for them to eat.

One night before dinner, a friend and I \u2013 her name begins with S, for swan, snake, seahorse \u2013 went swimming in the pool, which was strictly against lodge policy. We were so focused on breaking the rules we didn\u2019t think about why they were in place until we climbed out and started down the pathway that led to our chalet.We heard the sound: the tug and tear of grass being pulled from the ground by megaherbivore lips.

It was also the same one taken in August 1873 by French painter Gabriel Lopp\u00e9, whose climb inspired Hart Dyke\u2019s own.\u201cLopp\u00e9 was a legendary painter of the Alps, and the peaks he saw and captured on his canvases are now disappearing,\u201d said Hart Dyke. \u201cI wanted to capture them again, partly to show the damage that\u2019s already been done, and partly to share one more glimpse of Europe\u2019s best-known mountain range before it disappears for ever.\u201dWithin the next few years, he said, no painter \u2013 or anyone else \u2013 will be able to make the climb. \u201cThe glaciers are melting so fast that as you cross, there\u2019s a kind of rippling effect on the surface that makes it almost impossible to walk on.\u201cThe bottoms of the glaciers have completely deteriorated: where Lopp\u00e9 saw pristine blue-white snow, I was looking at dirt and black ice.\u201dThe painting Death Mask by James Hart Dyke depicts the pinnacle of a glacier on Mont Blanc where the ice has completely disappeared. Photograph: James Hart DykeAs Hart Dyke climbed, rocks were becoming dislodged around him. \u201cThe ice sticks everything together, so now it\u2019s melting, the rocks are coming away and the possibility of an avalanche is very high.\u201dHart Dyke\u2019s Mont Blanc paintings will be exhibited in London at Cromwell Place, South Kensington, later this month alongside those of Lopp\u00e9, highlighting the difference the climate crisis has made to the glaciers and the mountain.Among 40 paintings by Hart Dyke will be one entitled Death Mask, which shows a serac, or glacier pinnacle, whose ice has disappeared completely. \u201cIt\u2019s black and ominous and it reminds me of the dark works of Goya, which also had a message about devastation and decline,\u201d he said.Hart Dyke discovered mountain painting in his 20s when he accompanied the then Prince Charles on a tour of the Himalayas as his official artist.After travelling there with the royal party in 1998, he returned several more times, and he has also painted in Patagonia, the Atlas mountains, the Scottish Highlands and the Lake District. He was embedded with British troops in Afghanistan as a war artist and in 2009 was artist in residence at MI6.He made his ascent of Mont Blanc in July 2022, carrying his easel and oil paints and accompanied by a team of guides, a photographer and climbers including French mountaineer Christophe Profit, said to be the only person now able to navigate the north face, and Lopp\u00e9\u2019s great-great-great-grandson, Gabriel Bellanger.Hart Dyke said: \u201cDue to the dramatic reduction in the volume of the glaciers since the 19th century, the route is now heavily crevassed and hardly anyone does it any more.\u201cThe hut halfway up was built to accommodate the 60 or 70 climbers who might have been attempting it at any time in the past \u2013 but on our trip there were only two or three other people staying. The route has become very challenging and we found it especially tough on the descent.French painter Gabriel Lopp\u00e9\u2019s artwork The Shadow of Mont Blanc at Sunset, painted from the summit in August 1873. Photograph: Courtesy of John Mitchell Fine Paintings\u201cWhen we got to the top, I was able to stand exactly where Lopp\u00e9 stood watching the sunset in 1873, and I couldn\u2019t but be aware of the huge changes that have happened across the years since. It was quite overwhelming \u2013 it felt like the most emotionally charged moment of my career.\u201dLopp\u00e9 was painting in the heyday of landscape artists: over the years since, it has become a less fashionable area of the art scene, but Hart Dyke believes it has much to offer a world in the throes of a climate crisis.\u201cI paint landscapes because they remind me \u2013 and I hope seeing them reminds others \u2013 of the simple joy of being alive. Being on top of a mountain is the best place I can think of to celebrate life and to be aware of nature, of the wonders of the planet.\u201cAnd right now there\u2019s an urgency to being aware of the landscape around us: because if we connect with it, we\u2019ll be more committed to the changes we have to make.\u201d",

        "text": "California lawmakers have voted to permanently protect the iconic western joshua tree, delivering a hard-won victory for environmentalists who have warned that the climate crisis has imperilled these fixtures of the high desert.The Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act was passed Tuesday, as part of the state\u2019s budget agreement. It prohibits the unpermitted killing or removal of the trees, requires the development of a conservation plan and creates a fund to protect the species. It appears to be the first California legislation focused on protecting a climate-threatened species.\u2018It gets worse every day\u2019: why are sea lions and dolphins dying along California\u2019s coast?Read more\u201cIt\u2019s been a long journey to get here,\u201d said Brendan Cummings, the conservation director of the Center for Biological Diversity, who has led efforts to list joshua trees as an endangered species for years. \u201cWe can finally move on from the debate over whether joshua trees should get protection, to focusing on actually implementing measures to help ensure that they get through the very difficult decades ahead.\u201dThe western joshua tree is one of two genetically distinct types (the other being the eastern joshua tree) and its range extends from Joshua Tree national park to the northern slopes of the San Bernardino and San Gabriel mountains.The spiny-crested, gangly plants can grow up to 40ft and live about 200 years. They have grown in California\u2019s eastern desert region since the Pleistocene era, 2.5m years ago. But global heating has threatened to decimate the species.A 2019 study led by researchers at UC Riverside found that only .02% of the species\u2019 habitat in Joshua Tree national park would remain viable after 2070, amid unmitigated climate crisis; even in the best-case-scenario only 19% may be saved.The law comes after California\u2019s fish and game commission deferred a decision on whether to list the species under California\u2019s Endangered Species Act and the Biden administration declined to protect the trees under the federal Endangered Species Act.The joshua tree's fruits in the Joshua Tree national park in California near Yucca Valley. Photograph: \u00c9tienne Laurent/EPAThose petitions faced fierce opposition from local officials, developers and renewable energy companies who said the protections could complicate or derail plans to build large-scale solar facilities in the desert and meet California\u2019s ambitious greenhouse gas reduction goals. About 40% of the western joshua tree\u2019s range is on private lands, in rapidly-growing desert communities.The new bill, which California\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom is expected to sign into law this week, \u201cfails to properly balance the protection of the species with the needs of our residents and business community, thereby threatening the quality of life in our deserts\u201d, officials for San Bernardino county, which encompasses much of the plant\u2019s range east of Los Angeles, said in a press release.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "With their bright yellow manes and sturdy stems, sunflowers might seem like a simple summer delight. But researchers say the plants are surprisingly enigmatic after discovering they don\u2019t use conventional processes to track the sun across the sky.Over the course of a day, sunflowers follow the path of the sun overhead \u2013 a process known as heliotropism \u2013 with their heads tilting progressively westwards as a result of cells elongating on the east side of the stem.At night, cells elongate on the opposite side of the stems resulting in the heads reorienting themselves towards the east.However researchers say the processes behind the solar tracking are an unexpected mystery.\u201cSo many of our results were different than we anticipated,\u201d said Prof Stacey Harmer, an author of the research at University of California, Davis.Many plants grow towards a light source \u2013 this is because when blue light receptors, called phototropins, are activated on the lighted side of the stem, they cause hormones called auxins to become concentrated on the other \u201cdark\u201d side.These auxins stimulate an elongation of cells, resulting in the stem bending towards the light.While new research suggests this mechanism explains how sunflowers bend towards artificial light indoors, it appears it does not account for the way sunflowers naturally track the path of the sun.Kansas man plants 1.2m sunflowers as 50th anniversary gift for his wifeRead moreWriting in the journal Plos Biology, Harmer and colleagues reported that they first analysed which genes were switched on within the stems of sunflowers grown indoors, when artificial blue light was shone from one direction.The results suggest genes relating to phototropins were primarily \u201cswitched on\u201d within the lighted side of the stem, with those related to and auxins and cell growth switched on within the shady side, suggesting sunflowers grown indoors turn towards blue light as a result of conventional processes.But when the team turned to the stems of outdoor sunflowers, they found something different. The east side of the stem, the side in sunlight, and the west side, the side in shade, showed little difference in terms of which of these genes were switched on.The researchers then tried blocking blue and ultraviolet or red and far-red light on their own, found neither attempt alone affected heliotropism in the outdoor plants, suggesting multiple light-signalling pathways are likely at play at the same time.In another twist, the team found when sunflowers grown indoors were moved outdoors, the plants began tracking the sun immediately.However, a different pattern of genes was switched on across their stems on their first day outside compared with when they were indoors or on subsequent days outdoors \u2013 suggesting some sort of adjustment mechanism was at play.Harmer said the work suggests findings obtained in controlled environments do not necessarily reflect what is happening in the wild.\u201cOur results suggest that both solar tracking and phototropism in real world conditions is much more complicated than we had expected,\u201d she said.",

        "text": "Bernard Looney, after four years talking about orderly transitions, has made a disorderly transition out of BP. Not being fully transparent with the board of directors \u2013 whether about past personal relationships with colleagues or anything else \u2013 usually has that outcome for a chief executive. On the company\u2019s version of events, this was clearly a resigning matter.The immediate question is succession. BP is the type of company that likes to promote from within and, with the 53-year-old Looney at the helm, the board probably thought it had a few more years to observe the internal jostling for position.Murray Auchincloss, the chief financial officer, who has got the gig on an interim basis, is the leading contender, but energy companies usually prefer their permanent chief executives to have more frontline operational experience. City analysts speculated that the chair, Helge Lund, who was chief executive of BG Group until the gas firm was bought by Shell in 2016, would fit the bill. That feels unlikely. Lund presumably wouldn\u2019t have opted for the non-executive life post-BG if he still wished to be a day-to-day boss.As importantly, the appointment process will reignite the debate about the pace of BP\u2019s transition towards net zero by 2050 \u201cor sooner\u201d. Looney himself wobbled \u2013 or so it seemed \u2013 in February when he scrapped the target of reducing hydrocarbon output by 40% by 2030 and opted for 25%.On the other hand, he stuck to his original plan for BP to have 50 gigawatts of wind and solar generating capacity by 2030 while simultaneously revving up other \u201ctransition growth engines\u201d such as biofuels, electric charging points and hydrogen. Even after the softening of hydrocarbon targets, BP is perceived within the big oil universe as a faster transitioner than Shell and positively speedy versus unashamedly oily US majors such as Chevron and ExxonMobil.But, in an age of sharply higher oil and gas prices, Exxon and Chevron shares have flown and BP\u2019s haven\u2019t. The stock market has rewarded purer fossil fuels producers over companies pushing into zero-carbon generation (albeit BP is still projected to have 75% of its earnings from fossil fuels in 2030). It doesn\u2019t help that BP is perceived to have overpaid for wind leases in the UK in 2021 and Germany this year and that the shares prices of wind specialists such as \u00d8rsted have slumped.So \u2013 in theory \u2013 if BP wished to slow its transition timetable, and be less windy and more gassy for a while, an unexpected opportunity has arisen. It is easier for a new leader to avoid the appearance of a screeching U-turn. No doubt a shift would be welcomed by a certain class of fund manager \u2013 those who aren\u2019t convinced (whatever their ESG marketing brochures say) that renewables will earn the same long-term returns as oil and gas and would like bigger dividends now.Yet a new direction for BP would surely also be ridiculous in these circumstances. First, the current strategy was endorsed by the entire board, not just Looney. Second, the detour in February was meant to be a definitive adjustment to market conditions. Third, Joe Biden\u2019s subsidy-heavy Inflation Reduction Act may eventually succeed in retipping the balance in favour of low-carbon investments.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It includes a ban on single-use plastic cutlery and plates, cotton buds, expanded polystyrene cups and plastic straws, as well as cutting back on plastic food packaging.The law conforms to a European Union directive limiting the use of single-use plastics and which aims to oblige polluters to clean up the mess they create.Cigarette manufacturers will also be responsible for educating the public not to discard their butts in the public space but it remains unclear how the clean-up will be implemented or what it will cost.New Zealand passes world-first tobacco law to ban smoking for next generationRead moreOne Catalan study put the cost at between \u20ac12-\u20ac21 per citizen per annum, a total of up to \u20ac1bn (\u00a3880m).Earlier this year, the Catalan government proposed introducing a scheme whereby cigarette butts could be redeemed for \u20ac0.20 each, which would add \u20ac4 to the current average price of \u20ac5 for a pack of 20. The scheme has not yet been introduced.It is assumed that the tobacco companies will pass on the cost to the consumer, providing one more incentive to quit the habit. According to last year\u2019s government statistics, about 22% of Spaniards smoke (16.4% of women and 23.3% of men) compared with an EU average of 18.4%.Nevertheless, despite the large number of smokers, especially among young people, popular opinion favours increased restrictions on smoking in public places. A survey by the family medicine association found that 85% favour further restrictions, with 72% backing a ban on smoking on the terraces of bars and restaurants.Cigarette ends are one of the most ubiquitous forms of litter and take about 10 years to decompose, in the process emitting toxic substances such as arsenic and lead.According to the Ocean Conservancy NGO, cigarette butts are the most common form of marine pollution, more even than plastic bags and bottles, with an estimated 5bn discarded in the ocean.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Saccharina latissima, meanwhile, varies hugely. \u201cI never find two alike. Never.\u201dBefore she works with the seaweed, she collates and bags it, labelled with the place and date of collection, and applies a secret sustainable treatment. In one of her workshops lie neat piles of treated seaweed tendrils, which, she points out, all have different features. In another room, the material is being treated on hangers. \u201cIt\u2019s a forest of seaweed,\u201d she says.Among her influences are the late British designer Alexander McQueen \u2013 who she says \u201cgoes all the way, he\u2019s so sincere\u201d \u2013 the Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo and the music of the Icelandic musician Bj\u00f6rk.

The mating behaviour was then recorded on video.The results, obtained from 54 females who experienced the clutches of a male, revealed that 83% of females gripped by a male tried rotating their body.Release calls such as grunts and squeaks were emitted by 48% of clasped females \u2013 all of whom also rotated their body.Tonic immobility \u2013 stiffening with arms and legs outstretched in a pose reminiscent of playing dead \u2013 occurred in 33% of all females clasped by a male, with the team adding it tended to occur alongside rotating and calling.Smaller females, they note, more frequently employed all three tactics together than larger ones.While unusual, tonic immobility \u2013 it turned out \u2013 had been seen before. \u201cI found a book written in 1758 by R\u00f6sel von Rosenhoff describing this behaviour, which was never mentioned again,\u201d Dittrich said.The team says tonic immobility could be a stress response. They found this was more common in smaller and therefore younger females, which could be a result of greater stress arising with less experience of reproduction.The three tactics, they add, allowed at least some females to evade the clutches of the males. \u201cDisplaying of mate avoidance behaviour resulted in the escape of 25 females.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It follows a huge oil spill that threatened a globally important marine biodiversity hotspot.Filipino environmentalists have travelled to the UK to meet representatives from Barclays, Standard Chartered and HSBC as part of efforts to stop the expansion of liquefied natural gas (LNG) power plants and terminals in and around the Verde Island Passage, a global marine biodiversity hotspot known for its whale sharks, corals, turtles and rich fisheries, which was badly affected by the oil spill this year.In February, the Princess Empress oil tanker sank off the east coast of Mindoro island and released 800,000 litres of heavy industrial oil into the sea. The 75-mile slick devastated hundreds of fishing communities on Mindoro, leaving local people requiring medical treatment.Oil seen near the location of the sunken tanker. Photograph: Alecs Ongcal/The GuardianThe passage, which connects the South China Sea with busy shipping routes through the archipelago, is the site of increasing LNG activity, with investments from Shell and the San Miguel Corporation, a Philippine conglomerate best known for its beer, in new power plants and LNG terminals.Filipino activists have urged HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered to restrict financing for LNG projects, which they say will only further damage marine life in the area with increased marine traffic.Fr Edwin \u201cEdu\u201d Gariguez, who won the Goldman environmental prize in 2012 for his fight to stop a proposed open-cast nickel mine opening on Mindoro, said: \u201cIn the Philippines, Standard Chartered is supporting San Miguel Corporation\u2019s gas plant, which is devastating the Verde Island Passage and wreaking ecological chaos.\u201cLocal communities and fisherfolk worry that these projects will be at the expense of [the passage\u2019s] richness and their own livelihoods. We will continue to resist these projects and protect the Verde Island Passage.\u201cBanks would do well to remember that their financing decisions are not made in a vacuum. They have consequences for local communities, who don\u2019t want fossil-fuel gas operations polluting their environment,\u201d he added.A crab covered in oil tries to crawl out of the sea at Buhay na Tubig, Mindoro. Photograph: Alecs Ongcal/The GuardianRecent data shows that banks and finance institutions are still investing heavily in fossil fuels despite signing up to net-zero pledges.According to the 2023 Banking on Climate Change report, produced by environmental NGOs analysing financial data, Standard Chartered was a leading financier for San Miguel Corporation over the past five years. HSBC and Barclays provided finance to Shell.Avril De Torres, an environmental lawyer who spoke at Standard Chartered\u2019s annual general meeting on Wednesday, said the recent oil spill was an indication of the damage to the area likely to come from more fossil fuels.\u201cWe should expect an onslaught of LNG tankers in this area.

The key barrier to recycling this waste is ensuring that the new concrete is as strong and safe as conventional concrete.Thousands dead, millions displaced: the earthquake fallout in Turkey and SyriaRead moreScientists in Syria, the UK and Turkey have now demonstrated that using recycled concrete to replace half of the aggregate in new concrete does not significantly affect its building performance.It is the first time concrete produced using rubble from buildings destroyed by war has been shown to be safe. Recycled concrete has been produced before in other places, but testing is required in each region because of local differences in how the concrete is made.The Syrian civil war began in 2011 and has destroyed more than 130,000 buildings, 70% of which were made from reinforced concrete. When the conflict finally ends, millions of displaced refugees are likely to return, meaning it is vital to find ways to lower the cost and increase the speed of reconstruction.The study was led by Prof Abdulkader Rashwani, a concrete expert from Sham University in Aleppo, Syria, where more than 40% of the buildings have been destroyed.Researchers at work.

We have now started to go to some local councils and help them to put some plans in place for the future. We can at least try to make this region safer and give people some hope.\u201dDr Theodore Hanein, of the University of Sheffield in England, who was also part of the research team, said: \u201cSadly, the war has left many buildings destroyed and now, after the devastating earthquake, even more buildings have been damaged or destroyed in northern parts of the country.\u201cPeople will want to rebuild the places destroyed. [Recycling] will save a lot of transportation from bringing in raw materials and that\u2019s usually where you have the most cost and aggregate is becoming scarce. People [in Syria] basically have nothing at the moment.\u201dThe research, published in the Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering, used rubble from destroyed buildings at 10 sites in and around al-Bab city in northern Syria. Concrete is made from aggregate \u2013 small pieces of rock \u2013 and sand, cement and water.Almost half of the buildings in Aleppo have been destroyed. Photograph: Abdulkader Rashwani and Bakry KadanThe testing process began by crushing the rubble, removing any steel or textiles and then washing the resulting aggregate. The fine material washed out contains the sand and cement and this is now also being studied to see if it can be reused.The recycled concrete aggregate was used to replace 50% of normal aggregate in making new concrete. The compressive and tensile strength of this was tested, as well as how much water, CO2 and chlorine it absorbed. The two gases can form acids that could rust steel used to reinforce the concrete.The concrete containing the recycled aggregate passed all the tests and the researchers said the protocol they had established could be used in other countries rebuilding from war and other disasters. The recycled aggregate could also be used to fill bomb craters and as foundations for roads.Hanein said working with the Syrian scientists had been rewarding. \u201cIt was fulfilling, and what was awesome about this project is that it\u2019s something they can use tomorrow and make a difference.\u201d",

        "text": "For decades, as dusk drew in every evening, up to 700 shags would fly from their foraging grounds near Fife to the Isle of May to roost for the night. Some of the birds had been doing this trip twice a day for 20 years, returning to the same cliff ledge, squabbling over who sat where.On 31 October, Mark Newell sat on the rock, waiting for their noisy return. He saw nothing. Eventually, 25 exhausted-looking birds straggled back. They did not fly off when he approached. The soundtrack of honking and bickering had stopped.\u201cIt was desolation,\u201d says Newell, who works for the UK Centre for Hydrology & Ecology (UKCEH) as the Isle of May field manager. After working on the island for 20 years, he says: \u201cSeeing the cliffs devoid of birds was a stark, alarming view.\u201dNewell stayed for four nights, and returned weeks later, but the flocks had disappeared. These birds survived two years of avian flu \u2013 which has swept through the UK\u2019s seabird colonies \u2013 only to disappear en masse.Experts say a series of storms in October, culminating in Storm Babet, had caused the disappearance \u2013 and likely death \u2013 of these birds. But their disappearance could be a microcosm of what is happening on other islands \u2013 and a warning of what happens to seabirds as extreme weather events become more frequent.\u201cThere are some birds out there that I\u2019ve ringed as chicks 20 years ago,\u201d says Newell. \u201cA week or two of bad weather and that\u2019s the end of them.\u201dThe seafront at North Berwick, as Storm Babet rages. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/GuardianRecords for the island have been kept since the mid-1970s, and there has never been such a heavy loss. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything on that scale at any point in the past,\u201d says Newell.Seabirds can live with occasional stormy weather but successive storms can result in \u201cwrecks\u201d, with hundreds of emaciated seabirds washing ashore. In December 2013 and February 2014, a series of particularly bad storms around the coast of Europe resulted in the death of more than 50,000 seabirds.The climate crisis is likely to make these events more frequent, and more destructive. Newell says: \u201cIt\u2019s usually easier to use shags as the example because we can see the immediate impact, whereas any extreme weather is going to have detrimental impacts on a whole range of seabirds.\u201dThe Isle of May, in the Firth of Forth, off eastern Scotland. Photograph: Porridge Picture Library/AlamyNewell estimates that 10% of the UK population of shags could have been affected by the recent storms because they nest on the UK\u2019s east coast, which took a particularly fierce battering.Shags feed within a mile of the coast but strong easterly winds stirred up the sea, which meant they could not hunt for days on end. They carry little fat because it reduces their ability to dive, and so die if they do not feed regularly.\u201cIn many cases these birds were of prime breeding age as well, so they should have several years of producing chicks. The fact they are not going to be is pretty heartbreaking,\u201d says Newell.The Isle of May was also hit by storms in 1993, 2004 and 2012-13. On those occasions approximately half of the isle\u2019s breeding population was lost.Shags have been found in coastal towns in Aberdeenshire in the aftermath of Storm Babet. Photograph: Courtesy of New Arc Wildlife RescueA report published last week found that more than half of the seabird species breeding on British and Irish coasts have declined over the past 20 years. The shag population has fallen by 20% over that period and is now at 20,000 breeding pairs.In the meantime, conservationists want to find their missing shags. There is a lack of data from other islands, so total losses will not be clear until next breeding season, but anecdotal evidence suggest many have died. Large numbers have been found dead or dying of starvation across the UK.Wild birds gain immunity to avian flu in \u2018encouraging sign\u2019 amid deadly outbreakRead moreThere have been reports of weak or dead shags around the Scottish east coast, and as far down as Suffolk and Dover in England, with one young bird seen in the Netherlands.

In the 30-odd villages on the hilly slopes of Jammu\u2019s Doda district, more than 200 farmers have shifted from maize to lavender production, starting a \u201cpurple revolution\u201d in the region.The village of Lehrote had a moment of agricultural fame this year when a 43-year-old farmer, Bharat Bhushan, won a prestigious award for innovative farming from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, one of several institutions across the country looking to find ways of coping with the climate crisis and its devastating impact on farming. Lavender, a drought-resistant crop, can be grown on poor soil and likes lots of sun but needs little water.Bharat Bhushan, a farmer in Lehrote, has become a role model for other small farmers. Photograph: Bharat Bhushan\u201cI started lavender farming in 2010, hesitantly, as an experiment due to the encouragement from the Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine [IIIM] Jammu,\u201d says Bhushan. \u201cIt is easy to grow, and does not require much irrigation. I used just cow dung as manure.\u201d In two years he was earning four times more than he had done growing maize.\u201cSeeing my success, many followed suit and now more than 500 farmers in this area who are part of self-help groups are engaged in this occupation. I have also started two nurseries for propagating lavender saplings. The village has become a lavender producing and distillation hub,\u201d says Bhushan, who has also installed machinery to extract oil from lavender flowers.\u201cThe best part about growing lavender is that many women in villages who are not allowed to work away from home have been encouraged to cultivate lavender around their homes because it is profitable, and this has made them self-reliant,\u201d he says.Women who are not allowed to work away from their villages can cultivate lavender around their homeBharat Bhushan, farmer\u201cThe domestic demand for lavender oil is high, and we sell distilled oil directly to industrial customers in cities in India, like Mumbai and Delhi. We also sell dried lavender for potpourri, sachets and flower arrangements, and hydrosol, which is formed after distillation from the flowers, used to make soaps and room fresheners.\u201dBhushan was inspired by a video conference with India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), which in 2016 launched the Aroma Mission, encouraging farmers whose livelihoods were affected by the climate emergency to grow crops such as lavender, rosemary and lemongrass, and medicinal plants such as ashwagandha, also known as Indian ginseng or Withania somnifera. It provides cuttings, helps in setting up distillation units for clusters of 50 farmers, tests oil quality and helps find buyers.Inspecting lavender in northern India.

Since 1700, according to research published this year, the UK has lost more than 75% of its wetlands as land has been drained for development and farming. The Industrial Revolution inevitably accelerated the destruction of terrain that was viewed simply as wasteland. But the tide may finally be turning for habitats that should be valued as 21st century environmental assets, crucial both to preserving biodiversity and protecting Britain\u2019s coastline.The welcome nomination of England\u2019s east wetlands as a possible Unesco world heritage site, announced by the government this month, potentially places them in the exalted company of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. For the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, the National Trust and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which jointly put forward the application, the move is a vindication of their efforts to put marshland and mudflats stretching from the Humber to the Thames on the political map.A greater profile will rightly focus attention on ongoing conservation efforts, helping to safeguard the interests of the 155 bird species that rely on the wetlands and their intricate ecosystem. Among other things, these boggy expanses function as a kind of avian pit stop, serving migratory birds travelling the East Atlantic Flyway from the Arctic Circle to southern Africa. This spring, 200,000 birds will feast on their fish and insects, find rich pickings in the mud and use marsh and wet meadow to breed and roost.The bid is therefore good news for guests such as curlews, oystercatchers, knots and pink-footed geese. But the Unesco publicity should also be used kickstart a wider discussion on climate adaptation along Britain\u2019s most vulnerable coastline. Carefully managed and renewed, the wetlands can act in the future as a vital carbon sink and a sponge-like shock absorber for increased water flows. It is projected that the east of England could witness sea level rises of up to 1.15m by 2100. In the country as a whole, an estimated 200,000 coastal properties will be at risk by 2050. Restored wetlands can help reduce the impact of storm surges and flooding, forming a natural line of defence for coastal communities. At Wallasea Island on the Essex coast, for example, 3m tonnes of soil displaced by Crossrail\u2019s construction has been used to recreate a lost wetland landscape, encouraging wildlife and reducing flooding risks. Further projects like that one should be supported.If Unesco status is achieved for the wetlands, two areas that featured in the BBC TV series Wild Isles \u2013 the Blakeney nature reserve and RSPB Minsmere \u2013 will be included. Neglected and undermined for centuries, some of the most beautiful places in Britain are getting the recognition they deserve. They can also play a vital role in helping the country adapt to the challenges of the future.",

        "text": "The British countryside is often perceived as universally accessible, a tranquil escape open for all to enjoy. But is this truly the case? From my experience as a member of and advocate for minority communities in the UK, it has become increasingly evident that time in the natural world is far less accessible to some of us than we would hope.I\u2019ve been adventuring in the outdoors for nearly 20 years now, and from the very beginning I noticed that I wouldn\u2019t bump into people like myself in rural spaces, despite my city being very diverse.One might think that nature, being free, is available to all. But free isn\u2019t enough when we consider the barriers faced by minority communities. Geographical limitations are often the first hurdle: most minority communities are based in urban areas, making it an endeavour both in terms of time and resources to travel to rural areas. A recent study showed the whitest areas of the country enjoy an astounding 144% more local footpaths than the most ethnically diverse.When the pandemic hit, I sensed there was an opportunity to start improving the diversity in our rural spaces, while tackling loneliness and connecting communities at the same time. I founded Muslim Hikers, a global movement that is now the largest community in the world for Muslims interested in the outdoors. What started as an online community quickly grew to include walking events, where we meet up and enjoy these spaces together.We set out to normalise these activities for underrepresented communities like ours, because barriers to accessing rural spaces are just the tip of the iceberg. Cultural norms can also play a significant role in deterring minority groups from engaging with the outdoors. In communities where outdoor activities have not been traditionally emphasised, there\u2019s a lack of knowledge about where to go, what to wear and how to prepare for something like a hike or camping trip. This absence of knowhow becomes self-perpetuating, preventing new generations from developing a relationship with the natural world.View image in fullscreen\u2018Organisations like Muslim Hikers (above, on a trip to Malham Cove, North Yorkshire), while geared towards specific communities, are promoting wider diversity in the outdoors.\u2019 Photograph: Muslim HikersMoreover, there\u2019s the overarching issue of not seeing oneself reflected in the outdoor community. From advertisements to social media, the faces we see enjoying green spaces often don\u2019t reflect the diversity of our communities. This lack of representation discourages people from feeling as if they belong in these spaces, and it is further worsened by experiences of overt racism and Islamophobia \u2013 a reality our organisation knows all too well.The consequences are manifold. Multiple studies show that exposure to nature significantly boosts mental and physical wellbeing. Lack of access to these health benefits is a societal failure that disproportionately affects minority communities. This disparity is not just a niche \u201coutdoorsy\u201d issue: it is a public health issue.A situation in which only some people see nature as \u201ctheirs\u201d diminishes our collective stewardship of these vital ecosystems. A person who has never felt the tranquillity of a forest, the grandeur of a mountain, or the vastness of an open field is less likely to advocate for the protection of these spaces.So what can be done? We must tackle this problem at both macro and micro levels. Policy changes need to be enacted that ensure equitable access to public footpaths and green spaces, especially in urban areas. Public transport routes to green spaces need to be improved and subsidised for lower-income households.Community-driven initiatives can also have an immediate impact. Organisations like ours, while geared towards specific communities, are promoting wider diversity in the outdoors. By organising group events that educate individuals on outdoor preparedness and etiquette, these initiatives are making the countryside more approachable and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of their ethnic or cultural background.Public bodies and private companies must also take responsibility. Whether it\u2019s outdoor brands showcasing more diversity in their advertising or local councils investing in accessible, safe, well-maintained footpaths, it\u2019s high time the outdoors became truly inclusive.While the British countryside may be open in theory, it is not, in practice, open to everyone. If we aim to cherish the universality of nature\u2019s beauty, we must make it universally accessible, too.\nHaroon Mota is a mountaineer and the founder of Muslim Hikers and Active Inclusion Network\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "text": "What did Sarah Bentley, the now ex-chief executive of Thames Water, mean when she warned repeatedly in her final months in the job that England\u2019s largest water and wastewater company had been \u201chollowed out over decades\u201d?A benign(ish) interpretation is that she was merely reprising what everybody has known for years: that Thames was rinsed by its former owners, most notably the Australian financial outfit Macquarie, which was the dominant shareholder from 2006 to 2017. That was the period in which the company\u2019s borrowings were increased towards today\u2019s towering level of \u00a314bn and the regulator Ofwat was reduced, more or less, to appealing for Macquarie to get out and make way for more far-sighted owners.Or was Bentley signalling that the hollowing out was worse than feared and now imperils the eight-year plan that was launched in March 2021 to \u201ctransform our company from an underperformer\u201d? Have, for instance, the financial assumptions of two years ago been blown apart so that the newish shareholders \u2013 who injected \u00a3500m as recently as March \u2013 now fear they would be throwing good money after bad if they advance the next \u00a31bn slug?In the absence of clear messages from the company, its shareholders or Ofwat, one can only make assumptions about how Thames could have deteriorated so suddenly to a point where the Treasury is panicked. Problem No 1 is well known: the inflationary backdrop, which is plainly an issue when the interest on slightly more than half your debt is linked to the RPI measure.But the less-publicised second problem may be heaping uncertainty upon uncertainty: it is the huge investigation by Ofwat and the Environment Agency to determine whether the industry was not treating as much sewage as it should have been at 2,000-plus treatment plants. Six companies, including Thames, are under specific attention and every legally constrained regulatory hint has suggested a major scandal. \u201cFrom what we have seen so far, the scale of the issue here is shocking,\u201d Ofwat\u2019s chief executive, David Black, said last summer.What\u2019s the potential bill for that one? Fines \u2013 if they\u2019re what\u2019s coming \u2013 may be the lesser part. A bigger headache would arrive if Thames et al are ordered to upgrade their plants to handle the quantities of sewage that they claimed in the first place. That is how the system is meant to work: the cost of new infrastructure is largely funded through water bills, but it\u2019s up to companies to maintain their assets to the required standard.Thames\u2019s regulatory capital value (RCV), or the value of its assets as agreed with Ofwat, was \u00a316.6bn in its last set of accounts. If, in fact, those assets require repair at the company\u2019s expense, one can see how financial problems could multiply. Both parts of the gearing equation \u2013 which Thames likes to present as akin to a mortgage on a house \u2013 would be moving in the wrong direction. The assets wouldn\u2019t be worth what was assumed, and the cost of financing would be rising.What are the options for Thames Water as crisis talks continue?Read moreA key feature at Thames is that gearing was 80.6% a year ago versus Ofwat\u2019s notional norm of 60% for a resilient company. Thus one can understand why the government feels it has \u201cno true grasp on the costs\u201d and fears a funding shortfall could be as much as \u00a310bn, as reported by the Guardian. Householders threatened with negative equity know the same feeling of despair and uncertainty.Yet the question of who should pay for any financial reconstruction of Thames is surely simple: shareholders and bondholders are on the hook. Both groups knew the rules, or should have done: in extremis, shareholders get wiped out and bondholders take haircuts.One can feel a sliver of sympathy for Omers and USS, the cuddly pension fund-types who arrived as shareholders as Macquarie departed and spoke the regulator-pleasing language of long-term investment horizons. They probably rue the day they got involved with Thames.Ultimately, though, it was up to them to assess the risks in backing a company that had been through the financial wringer for 20-odd years, even before Macquarie\u2019s ill-starred stewardship. As for the lenders, if they wanted true risk-free returns in the UK, they should have bought index-linked gilts. As the admirable Feargal Sharkey says, it would be disgraceful if a penny of public money is spent on bailing out Thames\u2019s financial backers.Ministers are said to be worried about the effect on foreign investment in UK infrastructure if the worst happens, but need to get a grip quickly. Not every water company is in Thames\u2019s dire condition. Even Yorkshire, also at the aggressive end of the financing spectrum, has been able to raise capital from shareholders. Thames Water\u2019s shareholders and bondholders must divide the financial pain between themselves.",

        "text": "The world\u2019s oceans were the hottest ever recorded in 2022, demonstrating the profound and pervasive changes that human-caused emissions have made to the planet\u2019s climate.More than 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions is absorbed in the oceans. The records, starting in 1958, show an inexorable rise in ocean temperature, with an acceleration in warming after 1990.Sea surface temperatures are a major influence on the world\u2019s weather. Hotter oceans help supercharge extreme weather, leading to more intense hurricanes and typhoons and more moisture in the air, which brings more intense rains and flooding. Warmer water also expands, pushing up sea levels and endangering coastal cities.The temperature of the oceans is far less affected by natural climate variability than the temperature of the atmosphere, making the oceans an undeniable indicator of global heating.Revealed: how climate breakdown is supercharging toll of extreme weatherRead moreLast year is expected to be the fourth or fifth hottest recorded for surface air temperatures when the final data is collated. During 2022, we saw the third La Ni\u00f1a event in a row, which is the cooler phase of an irregular climate cycle centred on the Pacific that affects global weather patterns. When El Ni\u00f1o returns, global air temperatures will be boosted even higher.The international team of scientists that produced the new ocean heat analysis concluded: \u201cThe Earth\u2019s energy and water cycles have been profoundly altered due to the emission of greenhouse gases by human activities, driving pervasive changes in Earth\u2019s climate system.\u201dProf John Abraham, at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota and part of the study team, said: \u201cIf you want to measure global warming, you want to measure where the warming goes, and over 90% goes into the oceans.\u201cMeasuring the oceans is the most accurate way of determining how out of balance our planet is.\u201cWe are getting more extreme weather because of the warming oceans and that has tremendous consequences all around the world.\u201dProf Michael Mann, at the University of Pennsylvania, also part of the team, said: \u201cWarmer oceans mean there is more potential for bigger precipitation events, like we\u2019ve seen this past year in Europe, Australia, and currently on the west coast of the US.\u201dHe said the analysis showed an ever-deeper layer of warm water on the ocean surface: \u201cThis leads to greater and more rapid intensification of hurricanes \u2013 something we\u2019ve also seen this past year \u2013 since the winds no longer churn up cold sub-surface water that would otherwise dampen intensification.\u201docean heat graphicResearch released on Monday by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed that many extreme weather events in 2022 had been made more likely and more intense by the climate crisis, such as the heavy rain that caused devastating floods in Chad, Niger and Nigeria.Reliable ocean temperature measurements stretch back to 1940 but it is likely the oceans are now at their hottest for 1,000 years and heating faster than any time in the last 2,000 years.The analysis, published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, used temperature data collected by a range of instruments across the oceans and combined separate analyses by Chinese and US teams to calculate the heat content of the top 2,000 metres, where most of the heating occurs.The oceans absorbed about 10 zettajoules more heat in 2022 than in 2021, equivalent to every person on Earth running 40 hairdryers all day, every day.Extreme weather caused 18 disasters in US last year, costing $165bnRead moreThe researchers also analysed salinity, which along with temperature determines water density and is a vital driver of ocean circulation. An index of the variability in salinity across the oceans reached a record high in 2022, showing continued amplification of the global hydrological cycle.Another important feature of the oceans is stratification, where the layering of water by density becomes stronger. This restricts the mixing of deeper, cooler and more nutrient-rich waters with surface waters.The long-term trend of increasing stratification continued in 2022, the scientists found, with \u201cimportant scientific, societal, and ecological consequences\u201d.One consequence, said Abraham, is that less mixing in the ocean means the surface layer absorbs less carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, increasing global warming.The researchers also said: \u201cThere are increasing occurrences of record-shattering heatwaves and droughts in the northern hemisphere, consistent with intensive ocean warming in the mid-latitude Pacific and Atlantic oceans.\u201dThe heating of the oceans, and the impacts on extreme weather, will increase until humanity reaches net zero emissions.In October, the World Meteorological Organization reported that the atmospheric concentration of all the main greenhouse gases \u2013 carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide \u2013 had reached record highs. WMO head Prof Petteri Taalas said: \u201cWe are heading in the wrong direction.\u201d",

He turned down three other claimed grounds for appeal.

We will continue to robustly defend his life-saving decision to expand the Ulez and continue with preparations without delay.\u201cIt is a shame that some local authorities have chosen to attempt this costly and misguided legal challenge instead of focusing on the health of those they represent.

        "text": "The restoration of much of Britain\u2019s vast canal network has been a notable and uplifting success story. Originally saved in the 1960s from Beeching-style closures by Labour\u2019s transport secretary, Barbara Castle, many of these formerly working and polluted waterways have become modern urban oases.Otters, kingfishers and dragonflies can be glimpsed along the 100 miles or so of Birmingham\u2019s canals. In Manchester, barge users and walkers can trace the origins of the Industrial Revolution along intersecting routes that crisscross the city. Across the country, canalside regeneration has transformed urban landscapes, partly enabled by the thousands of unpaid volunteers who rescued abandoned channels from dereliction and paved the way for Castle\u2019s vision of \u201cleisureways\u201d to become a reality.Environmentally rich, historically fascinating and a source of human wellbeing, thriving canals should be a treasured feature of our greener future. The government, however, appears to have other ideas. Having previously frozen funding for the Canal & River Trust (CRT) \u2013 the charity that in 2012 took over the management of 2,000 miles of state-owned canals \u2013 ministers now plan cuts of over \u00a3300m to its finances, beginning in 2027.As the CRT is forced to seek alternative sources of cash, this shortsighted decision will stretch resources beyond breaking point. Volunteers already have to be relied on for clean-up work and other tasks, and trust leaders have said that the sharp reduction in funds will put at risk \u201cinvaluable natural habitats, historic infrastructure and cherished public spaces\u201d. Some canals, they warn, may have to close. Last week, a group of council leaders wrote to the secretary of state for the environment, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, noting that large stretches of London\u2019s network will be affected, including Little Venice.There are many good reasons to want to see the back of this government, but one of the most emotionally compelling is its distaste for the kind of public infrastructure that makes life better for people. It remains to be seen whether ministers will choose to ignore the overwhelming opposition to plans to close railway station ticket offices. But their apparent willingness to endanger the spectacular renaissance of the country\u2019s canals is evidence of the same ideological blind spot: the modern Conservative party just doesn\u2019t understand the value of public goods.A 2019 report, Waterways in Progress, published by the Inland Waterways Association, memorably describes Britain\u2019s canals as \u201ca linear national park\u201d. Among other case studies, the authors highlight the social and economic benefits delivered by the restoration of a five-mile stretch of the Chesterfield canal, in which a former lock-house now hosts a cafe, a meeting room, shower facilities and a play and picnic area. Much of this was made possible by Whitehall money released as part of the Community Assets programme.This is the kind of reimagining of waterways that Castle \u2013 a boat enthusiast who regularly travelled on the Rochdale canal \u2013 foresaw. Noting their potential for leisure use in the Transport Act of 1968, she established public bodies to promote \u201ccruising, fishing and other recreational purposes\u201d on the canals. Five decades on, the progress has been remarkable. The government has a responsibility to ensure that it is maintained, rather than undermined by funding cuts deeply at odds with the spirit and direction of the times.",

The effects on marine life were profound.Abalone fishers reported a rise in catch mortality, Tasmania\u2019s salmon farming industry lost stock to the warm water, tropical fish moved in and there was an outbreak of the highly contagious viral infection Pacific oyster mortality syndrome.Hobday said there could be similar sorts of impact this summer if the forecast heatwave crashed into the coast.\u201cThen we would expect to see impacts on aquaculture, we\u2019d expect to see new species showing up in southern south east Australia, we\u2019d expect to see impacts on remaining kelp forest in the region,\u201d he said, noting that Tasmania\u2019s giant kelp species had already lost 95% of its historical range.Salmon farmers may opt to harvest early, try to boost oxygen levels in the water, or change their feed mix.Hobday said he would publish a paper in September advising researchers, industry and others how to prepare for the hotter, drier weather expected with the likely onset of El Ni\u00f1o conditions after three relatively wet, cool years in Australia.Rich Little, also from the CSIRO, is part-way through a project to determine how marine life has changed in south-eastern waters over recent decades.Little and a team of scientists spent July aboard a research vessel that travelled up Tasmania\u2019s east coast to near Eden, on the New South Wales south coast, and back again.

Authorities say the horses damage endangered species and ecosystems in the park.The state has a legislated target to reduce the feral horse population to 3,000 by mid-2027, but officials have estimated there are up to 22,500 horses in the park.At a parliamentary inquiry into aerial shooting on Monday, the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service head, Atticus Fleming, was quizzed about the trial\u2019s \u201crepeat shooting\u201d policy.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nSome horses were shot up to 15 times during the trial, while the animals were on average shot more than seven times.\u201cI think it is humane,\u201d said Fleming, who oversees national parks as the state\u2019s acting environment and heritage coordinator general.He described the trial\u2019s results as \u201coutstanding\u201d, saying the repeat shooting policy contributed \u201cto a very good welfare outcome\u201d.Crocodile snapped swimming in Ingham drain as Queensland flood waters surgeRead more\u201cIt means there are multiple shots to the target area literally within seconds ... that is an important component in ensuring the most rapid death possible,\u201d Fleming said.Advice from the RSPCA and vets backed repeat shooting, which led to an average time to unconsciousness of five seconds during the trial, he said.The environment minister, Penny Sharpe, announced in October the state would return to aerial shooting of feral horses to control population numbers.The feral horse count in the national park has exploded since then-NSW Nationals leader and deputy premier John Barilaro opposed culls in favour of trapping and rehoming in 2018.Some forms of culling were reintroduced in 2021 in an effort to bring the population down to a sustainable figure, but numbers have continued to increase.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A small number in colonies several miles away are all accounted for.The couple, who want to remain anonymous to protect the animal\u2019s location, said: \u201cSome of our trees began to go missing overnight and others were simply being mauled.

Photograph: ScreengrabThe animal\u2019s origins are unknown, but it was found living near a rural property in Pembrokeshire, where it had started to build itself a lodge under the family\u2019s pond deck.Nicknamed Anthony by the family after the military historian Antony Beevor, the rodent has become as \u201cfat as a pig,\u201d spending as much as six hours a night chewing tree trunks and dragging branches around.Beavers, which can grow to the size of a large spaniel, were once found throughout Britain but were hunted to extinction in the 16th century for their fur, meat and the oil in their scent glands.They have, however, been slowly reintroduced in recent years. Since the first reintroduction in Argyll in 2009, beaver numbers have been increasing across the UK through enclosed colonies set up by various wildlife trusts.This is thought to be only the fourth time a beaver has been found living wild in Britain.Alicia Leow-Dyke of the beaver project at Wildlife Trusts Wales, said it was a nice surprise to see the creature seemingly enjoying life in the wild \u2013 though how it got there was \u201ca bit of a mystery\u201d.The most likely theory is that it was released by rewilding enthusiasts, who have let beavers roam free elsewhere in Britain because of their positive effect on the ecosystems.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Australia\u2019s parliament has passed the country\u2019s most significant emissions reduction legislation in more than a decade after the government won backing from Greens and independent MPs for a plan to deal with pollution from major industrial sites.After weeks of closed-door negotiation, a deal was brokered between the Labor government and Greens, a minor party with 15 parliamentarians, that included legislating an explicit requirement that total emissions from major industrial facilities must come down, not just be offset.Australia is the world\u2019s third biggest fossil fuel exporter. The Greens argued the deal would stop some new gas and coal development proposals, but acknowledged it would not prevent further industry expansion.The latest IPCC report makes it clear no new fossil fuel projects can be opened. That includes us, Australia | Adam MortonRead moreThe deal to pass changes to the policy known as the safeguard mechanism is considered key to prime minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s commitment to cut national carbon dioxide emissions 43% by 2030 compared with 2005 levels.From 1 July, many of the country\u2019s 215 major polluting facilities \u2013 including fossil fuel operations, other mines, refineries and smelters \u2013 will need to cut emissions intensity by 5% a year, either through absolute cuts or by buying contentious carbon offsets. Together, they are responsible for about 30% of emissions in Australia.While individual companies can buy an unlimited number of offsets, total absolute emissions under the scheme cannot increase and are required to come down over time. New gas fields opened for export project must offset all CO2 emissions, increasing costs for developers. Labor had rejected an initial offer from the Greens to support the bill if the government agreed to ban new coal and gas developments in line with scientific warnings.The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, hailed the deal as a \u201clandmark reform\u201d that delivered on a promise to reverse nearly a decade of inaction on the climate crisis under the rightwing Coalition administration that held power from 2013 until last year.He said it would lead to a 205m tonne reduction in emissions by 2030, which he described as equivalent to taking two-thirds of the nation\u2019s cars off the road. \u201cToday is an historic day for the country to ensure our economy can take advantage of the opportunities of decarbonisation and meet our ambitious climate targets,\u201d Bowen said.The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, described negotiating with the government as \u201clike negotiating with the political wing\u201d of coal and gas companies, but said fossil fuels had \u201ctaken a huge hit\u201d.\u201cTo everyone who is despairing about the future and wants real climate action, today you should have a spring in your step, because it shows we can take on the coal and gas corporations and win,\u201d Bandt said. \u201cThe fight is not over, because in the middle of a climate crisis, Labor still wants to open more coal and gas.\u201dThe legislation was opposed by the rightwing Liberal-National Coalition, despite it having introduced the safeguard mechanism in 2016. It initially promised the safeguard would stop industrial emissions increasing, but in practice often allowed companies to emit beyond onsite limits without penalty.The Coalition\u2019s climate change spokesperson, Ted O\u2019Brien, said the changes to the scheme made it a \u201ccarbon tax by stealth\u201d that would \u201cdecapitate\u201d the economy. But the policy won broad support from major business and industry groups. Environment groups also supported the deal, but called on the government to stop allowing developments that expanded Australia\u2019s fossil fuel exports.",

The team wants to work out why the \u201cmysterious\u201d and \u201cintriguing\u201d garden bug has its fin, and discover more about its lifecycle as well as which plants may host it.Giant willow aphids are regularly seen from July to February, with a peak in sightings in autumn. As the name may suggest, they are found on willow in particular, but the RHS wants to know if they are found on other plants, and especially if they are seen between February and the end of May.Seaweed compost and bean \u2018manure\u2019 among RHS garden trends for 2023Read moreThe insects are easy to see with the naked eye but sometimes retreat into crevices in bark to hide from predators. They are usually seen on the stems and branches of trees, and do not cause unsightly damage to host plants, which can withstand the delicate feeding from these insects.In May 2022, colonies were found on a quince tree (Cydonia oblonga) in Hertfordshire, a new host for this aphid. They had previously mainly been found on willow and occasionally on other trees including apple and poplar. Dr Andrew Salisbury, RHS principal entomologist, said: \u201cThe sighting of giant willow aphids on quince, a previously unrecorded host, at a time of year when they are rarely seen, only raises more questions about this fascinating and sometimes elusive aphid.\u201cDespite thorough research, it isn\u2019t certain where they go from April to June, and their host range needs more investigation. We are asking gardeners for their help tracking this aphid down to help answer these intriguing questions about this unusual species.\u201dGardeners are being used more than ever in science experiments as an untapped resource. Private garden space in Britain covers about 728,900 hectares (1.8 million acres) so their potential as a haven for wildlife is considerable. The RHS\u2019s chief ecologist, Gemma Golding, recently asked gardeners to send pictures of interesting \u201cweeds\u201d in the hope that rare wild plants are discovered growing in new places.The RHS has also taken more of an interest in wildlife-friendly gardening in recent years, with painstakingly maintained and sterile gardens becoming a thing of the past.The RHS, which runs Chelsea Flower Show, has changed its attitude to previously unwanted visitors to the garden, last year announcing it would no longer class slugs and snails as pests. Britain\u2019s leading garden charity said that although the gastropods were the garden visitor about which they received most complaints, they should be considered an important part of the garden ecosystem. At RHS flower shows, you are now just as likely to receive tips for how to entice nature into your garden as you are to see perfectly pruned roses.Sightings of the giant willow aphid, which must include a picture, can be submitted to the RHS here.",

The problem was actually building the batteries.The company\u2019s efforts have now come to nothing. It collapsed into administration on Tuesday after funding talks failed, leaving a string of disappointed backers ranging from the FTSE 100 companies Glencore and Ashtead to the property investor Tritax, owned by investment group abrdn, which had committed to fund a battery \u201cgigafactory\u201d in Northumberland.Some of the investors are sanguine.

The bigger investors have lost millions of pounds, but not enough to make a material impact on their balance sheets.It is the UK government that must now answer some big questions about the future of the British car industry. In January 2022 Boris Johnson hailed the \u201cEV battery pioneer\u201d for planning to create \u201cthousands of jobs\u201d. Less than a year later, Johnson is out of Downing Street, Britishvolt is bankrupt, and the future of the UK car industry is under serious threat.The British industry is painfully reliant on producing cars with petrol or diesel engines, but it still has a shot at retooling for the battery age. The one shining example is the Chinese-owned Envision AESC. It is working on a \u201cgigafactory\u201d in Sunderland, with 38 gigawatt hours (GWh) of annual output to supply the Japanese carmaker Nissan next door. Envision managers estimate that 100GWh would be enough to attract a full supply chain and its well-paid jobs to the UK.Britishvolt\u2019s failure could give Tata group, the Indian owner of Jaguar Land Rover, a stronger hand in negotiations over where it builds its battery factory. Tata Motors\u2019 chief financial officer, P.B.

        "text": "A study suggests the benefits from cleaner air could be even greater than previous data had indicated.Researchers investigated the closure of a coal processing plant in 2016. Located on Neville Island in the Ohio River, near Pittsburgh in the US, the site had been used to produce coal-coke for steelmaking for about 100 years. Closure of the plant resulted in an immediate reduction in air pollution for the local communities. Sulphur dioxide decreased by 90%, arsenic by 66% and particle pollution also improved.There was an immediate 42% decrease in emergency room visits for heart problems and further declines in the three years that followed, until the end of study, showing that the closure led to long-term health improvements. A similar pattern was seen in stroke cases. These changes were not seen in two communities away from the plant that were used as experimental controls.When looking at medical statistics it is possible to overlook the real-world experience of the people affected. Testimony from the local community reveals what it was like to live with the air pollution, dust and odour from the plant. Some people explained how they struggled to manage their asthma and others said their breathing problems got worse when they first moved into the area. It was routine to close windows at night as pollution settled over the community.Air pollution is often invisible in our everyday lives. Reminiscent of the Covid lockdowns, the plant closure brought immediate changes, with people suddenly noticing crystal-blue skies, instead of haze, and the smells of nature along with improvements to their health.Prof George Thurston, of New York University Grossman School of Medicine, who led the study said: \u201cWe found much larger cardiac health benefits from the plant\u2019s closure than expected. This provides solid confirmation that fossil fuel-related air pollution is far more toxic than other types of air pollution. Policymakers have been greatly underestimating the local and immediate human health benefits that will occur as we phase out fossil fuel processing and combustion in our cities and towns.\u201dProf Dan Greenbaum, of the US Health Effects Institute, who was not involved in the Pittsburgh study, said: \u201cThis type of study is one of the best ways to test whether exposure to air pollution actually causes ill health. Simply put, if you reduce the air pollution someone is breathing, can you measure improved health? That clearly is the case for the citizens near Pittsburgh.\u201dPolicies to improve air pollution are often gradual and can lack the ambition to make big changes that occurred near Pittsburgh. This makes it harder to detect the health benefits.Despite this, a 17% reduction in deaths from breathing problems followed a ban on the sale of smokey types of coal in Dublin in 1990. In Launceston, Tasmania, a scheme to incentivise homeowners to switch away from wood heating reduced winter respiratory deaths by 28% and heart deaths by 20%, and improvements in air pollution in Sweden were found to help children\u2019s lung growth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Armada Way, the pedestrianised boulevard that runs south through the city centre to the sea, is a rare postwar conservation area and ought to be a national showpiece. Instead, ugly images of debris strewn among the modern architecture have upset and angered local people and conservationists. They may also set back efforts to boost the city by attracting tourists.The upset and anger are more than justified by events. A consultation regarding the proposed regeneration of the city centre showed that a majority of locals do not support it. A campaign group, Save the Trees of Armada Way (Straw), gathered a petition of more than 16,000 names. Yet the council ploughed on until it was served with a court injunction by campaigners. On Monday, Mr Bingley resigned, ahead of a council meeting.But the chainsaws were not the work of one man. The whole administration stands discredited ahead of May\u2019s local elections. Even the two local Conservative MPs, Johnny Mercer and Sir Gary Streeter, believe that Labour should now take over the council (so far Labour\u2019s Tudor Evans has resisted this, saying that the decision should be made at the ballot box). The infighting and incompetence of local Tories lie behind this declaration of no confidence. Last year, one former councillor, David Downie, said that he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the Conservative cabinet\u2019s lack of experience. Mr Bingley is on record as having said that people shouldn\u2019t \u201cworry too much about climate change\u201d.Such cavalier attitudes are outdated. It is a sign of progress that so many people now recognise the importance of trees, not only as attractive local features but as wildlife habitats with a role in sequestering carbon and keeping streets cool. Developments for new housing or other infrastructure should work around them. Promises to plant new trees are no substitute for looking after those that already exist. Where developers present plans that are harmful to nature, councils must push back and demand alternatives.In its dismissal of local people\u2019s feedback, this council showed itself to be as high-handed with voters as with the environment. Just as happened in Sheffield, where a Labour council destroyed public trust through its handling of protests over the removal of street trees, Plymouth\u2019s leaders adopted a bunker mentality. Spending \u00a312.7m of levelling up funds within the allotted timeframe was what mattered. They believed their plan to be a good one, and that was that.Except it wasn\u2019t, and their poor stewardship of precious local assets has been shown up. Clearly there are lessons here for Plymouth, where control of the council has switched between Labour and the Tories, and previous regeneration projects have produced good results. But there are wider lessons too. Cambridgeshire county council, which is run by a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition, has just approved plans to cut down an orchard to make way for a road. In too many areas, and in local parties of different stripes, politicians\u2019 actions are failing to live up to their climate pledges. Development that takes us further away from our climate and biodiversity goals should no longer be called by that misleading name.",

This includes almost 650 miles of pedestrian fencing, steel and concrete barriers impossible for most animals to cross. Biden has continued building new sections despite a campaign promise to halt all wall construction.The Texas wildfire deaths took place at a Bush-era section of the concrete pedestrian fencing, built at the edge of the floodplain along existing earthen levees \u2013 human-made structures that wildlife were able to cross unimpeded.

As a result, there is little research into the effects of the 30-ft tall barriers on threatened and endangered species, or on the risks posed by fires and floods.But environmentalists have long warned that the border wall poses a serious threat as it impedes wildlife from accessing food, water, shelter, mates \u2013 and safety. In 2009, hundreds of tortoise shells were found in the Rio Grande after major floods, and the FWS suspected that other trapped animals including ocelots and jaguarundi may have also died.Now, the climate crisis is exacerbating the risks as extreme weather events such as floods, fire and drought increasingly batter the entire US \u2013 including the southern border.Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has created a few dozen small wildlife openings in the newer bollard wall in parts of Arizona, but nowhere along the concrete levee sections along the river, where the animals perished last August.

It has found that all of London\u2019s hospitals, medical centres and care homes are in areas that breach the World Health Organization\u2019s guidelines for nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter.The expanded Ulez would cut the number of the most polluting cars on London\u2019s roads by a further 20,000-40,000 daily.

However, while the number of butterflies recorded this summer has been the highest since 2019, the longer-term trends show worrying declines for some of the UK\u2019s most common butterfly species.\u201dThe Big Butterfly Count data over the last 13 years reveals numbers of the once ubiquitous small tortoiseshell have fallen by 30%, with even larger declines for the speckled wood (-38%), ringlet (-41%), common blue (-44%) and green-veined white (-61%).The red admiral is one species benefiting from global heating and hit top spot in the count for the first time this summer, its numbers soaring by 338% compared with last year. Its numbers have risen by 78% over the 13 years of the count.Four other species appear to be thriving in an era of big climatic changes, with long-term increases over 13 years for the painted lady (up 113%), the holly blue (+41%), large white (+27%) and small copper (+66%).Dr Richard Fox, the head of science at Butterfly Conservation, said: \u201cWhile the weather certainly has an impact on numbers from year to year, butterflies, moths and many other species can generally cope with variable weather. What they can\u2019t cope with is habitat destruction. Butterflies need a place to live. If they can feed, breed and shelter, they can thrive.\u201dButterfly Conservation is calling on people to create a wild space in any outdoor area to help butterflies, moths and other insects.

Fortunately, researchers kept three small plants in pots on a windowsill in the University of York. These short-lived annual plants soon died, but they produced a precarious pinch of seed, which was lodged at Kew\u2019s Millennium Seed Bank.Andrew Shaw of the Rare British Plants Nursery had a vision to bring the species back to life, but when tests were carried out on some privately held seeds very few germinated successfully.So Natural England, the government\u2019s conservation watchdog, quickly authorised a de-extinction attempt via its species recovery programme, which has funded the revival of the most threatened native species for 30 years.\u201cThe Millennium Seed Bank said the seed was getting near the end of its lifespan and so we thought we would only have one more chance of resurrecting it,\u201d said Alex Prendergast, a vascular plant senior specialist for Natural England.Natural England paid for a polytunnel at the Rare British Plants Nursery in Wales, where 100 of the tiny seeds were planted. To the botanists\u2019 surprise, 98 of the seeds germinated successfully. The polytunnel rapidly filled with a thousand York groundsel plants.In February six grams of seed \u2013 potentially thousands of plants \u2013 were sown into special plots around York on council and Network Rail land.This week, the first plants in the wild for 32 years began to flower, bringing colour to the streets and railway sidings of York.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Russia produced 150m tonnes in 2022 and expects to produce 120m tonnes this year.The soil-dwelling invertebrates contribute to 6.5% of grain harvests, according to the study, published in Nature Communications this week. Crops include rice, maize, wheat and barley. If an average loaf of bread is made up of 15 slices, this means one per loaf depends on worms\u2019 activity to be produced.Earthworms contribute to the growing of 2.3% of legumes, which includes soya beans, peas, chickpeas and lentils. This is probably smaller because legumes can fix their own nitrogen, which makes them less dependent on worms, researchers said.As worms burrow and feed underground, they break down organic matter and aerate soils, increasing fertility and making nutrients available for smaller organisms. They also help soils capture and retain water.Scientists have long been aware that the presence of earthworms makes crops grow better \u2013 naturalist Charles Darwin was writing about it in 1881 \u2013 but before this research, it wasn\u2019t known by how much.\u201cThis is the first effort that I\u2019m aware of that\u2019s trying to take one piece of soil biodiversity and say: \u2018OK, this is the value of it; this is what it\u2019s giving us on a global scale,\u2019\u201d said lead researcher Steven Fonte from Colorado State University. \u201cSoils are just such an intricate habitat but there has really been very few efforts to understand what that biodiversity means to our global crop yields.\u201dIndian mystic Sadhguru on 100-day motorbike mission to save soilRead moreResearchers looked at the impact of worms on grains and legumes by analysing and overlaying maps of soil properties and crop yields with a global atlas of earthworm abundance.Earthworms contributed proportionally more in areas of the global south: 10% of grain yield in sub-Saharan Africa, and 8% in Latin America and the Caribbean, is down to worms, researchers said. This is probably because these farmers tend to use fewer fertilisers and pesticides, relying instead on manure and rotting organic matter, which helps increase earthworm abundance.Topsoil is where 95% of the planet\u2019s food is grown. Last month, research showed that soil contains more than half of all species. Although the impact of earthworms is notable, other soil organisms may be \u201cequally as important\u201d but further study is needed, the paper said, and only a fraction are believed to have been identified.Soil biodiversity has been historically undervalued, said Fonte, and this study showed how it enhances agricultural productivity.\u201cSoils are still this huge, big black box that we don\u2019t fully understand,\u201d he said. \u201cThis work helps show that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity that we\u2019re just kind of ignoring.\u201dFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X (formerly known as Twitter) for all the latest news and features",

On oil and gas, he has a bill to encourage greater exploitation of North Sea resources, while Labour wants to stop new licences for fossil fuels.On law and order, there are a range of new policies toughening up sentencing, and measures to tackle knife crime. But there is a good chance Labour will refuse to fall into the trap of opposing many of these measures for fear of being painted as soft on crime.Sunak\u2019s advisers believe the Tories have a strong record on crime rates but Labour begs to differ, highlighting a court system in crisis, crumbling and overcrowded jails and a lack of police responsiveness to crimes such as burglary.With more than 20 bills on offer, many of the other pieces of legislation are carried over from the last session of parliament or dealing with relatively niche issues, such as banning councils from boycotting goods from certain countries on political grounds.00:01:15UK facing \u2018significant long-term challenges\u2019, says Charles in king's speech \u2013 videoWhat is perhaps most telling about the legislative programme is that there is very little attention paid to some of the issues that voters care about the most: an absence of measures to help the NHS beyond the smoking ban, nothing concrete on education, little on the environment except for a long delayed animal welfare bill, no improvements to employment rights, nor any direct measures to address the cost of living crisis.The closest the speech comes to offering change that has a meaningful impact on people\u2019s lives are Michael Gove\u2019s renters\u2019 reform and leasehold reform bills, designed to improve the housing market.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Conservative MPs will be hoping for a sign of tax cuts to come or other voter-friendly measures to help people struggling with the effects of inflation.Without big new policies, they will fear that too little is being done to shift the dial with voters, and that the Tories cannot go into an election relying, as in the past, on claims of being a safe economic pair of hands and competent government when Liz Truss and Boris Johnson have destroyed that reputation.Neither are any of the king\u2019s speech bills particularly relevant to Sunak\u2019s main priorities \u2013 stopping small boats, cutting waiting lists, bearing down on inflation, improving the economy and reducing debt \u2013 although the prime minister would argue many of his bills are aimed at supporting growth.It all adds up to a sense that Sunak lacks an overarching narrative on where his government is going over the next year \u2013 apart from his slogan about taking decisions for the long term.

But the large blue (Phengaris arion) \u2013 the species that has been worst affected across Europe, where numbers are down 82% since 1990\u2013 is actually thriving in Britain due to a reintroduction programme and ongoing targeted conservation management.Other species showing significant declines across Europe include the wall (Lasiommata megera), down 68%, the adonis blue (Lysandra bellargus), falling by 64%, and the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), down 61%.Conservation scientists attribute the ongoing declines to agricultural intensification. This includes the ploughing of traditional grasslands and the heavy use of fertilisers and herbicides, which destroy the wildflowers and grasses that butterfly caterpillars feed on.Nitrogen deposition from vehicle emissions and agriculture is also a factor, alongside global heating.Nigel Bourn, chief scientist at Butterfly Conservation, said: \u201cThese really horrific large-scale declines are driven by major changes across Europe, although it\u2019s very difficult to tease apart the relative contribution of all these major changes we\u2019re seeing.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty depressing.

We have to find a new more wildlife-friendly way of growing food and we\u2019ve still got quite a long way to go.\u201dThe figures are based on data from the European grassland butterfly indicator, a key measure of the health of European grasslands, which has been compiled by Butterfly Conservation Europe.European conservationists hope the EU\u2019s proposed nature restoration law, which sets out binding targets to reverse the decline in wild insect pollinators and return nature to ecosystems, will help to halt the losses.Member states will be given two years after the regulation has been introduced to submit plans on how they intend to meet the targets. They are also obliged to record whether their measures work, with the European grassland butterfly indicator being one of the key markers of success.Dr Martin Warren, head of development at Butterfly Conservation Europe, said: \u201cThe rapid decline of Europe\u2019s grassland butterflies is a clear warning sign of the plight of wildlife across Europe.

At that conference, China pledged CO2 emissions would peak by 2030. Xi said that China would \u201cstrictly control coal-fired power generation projects\u201d.But 2021 was also the year in which severe power outages blighted many parts of China, leading to rationing, closed factories and cold homes as local authorities struggled to cope with sudden shortages of energy.In 2022, further energy crunches in south-west China underlined the importance of stable energy supplies to Chinese officials. That has put the commitment to reduce reliance on coal-fired energy in direct tension with the new emphasis on energy security.\u201cChinese officials view coal as the primary guarantee of energy security,\u201d said Anders Hove, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. \u201cFor this reason, it is now considered sensitive to criticise the country\u2019s present investments in coal.\u201dLocal governments in China approved 50.4GW of new coal power in the first half of 2023. And in 2022, construction started on 50GW of coal capacity, an amount six times as large as the rest of the world combined.Despite growing demand for energy, China still has far more coal power capacity than it needs. Last year the average utilisation rate for coal power plants was just over 50%.Experts say that the way to ensure China\u2019s energy security is to improve the technological infrastructure of the grid to make it more stable and efficient, not build new dirty generators.\u201cEnergy storage is the key for China\u2019s energy transition,\u201d said Gao Yuhe, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia. Energy storage can enable \u201crenewable energy to take a leading role in the whole energy transition\u201d.Coal power plants take a long time to power up and cool down, meaning that they are relatively inflexible. Renewable energy storage enables the grid to overcome the challenge created by the fact that most of China\u2019s renewable energy is generated in the west of the country, while most of the energy consumption happens in the east.President Joe Biden with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Apec summit in California on 15 November. Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersGetting the energy to the right place at the right time is one of the biggest challenges facing China\u2019s energy transition. Local government officials, who are more concerned with keeping the lights on than with green targets, see coal as a safety net.During last year\u2019s power crunch in Sichuan, a heatwave raised the demand for energy as people turned on air-conditioning units. At the same time, a drought meant that there was much less hydropower energy generation.\u201cSichuan suddenly couldn\u2019t meet their electricity export obligations and meet local demand,\u201d said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst for the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. A rigid energy planning system meant that Sichuan continued to export energy, even when it created local blackouts.\u201cLocal governments do not want to phase out coal as soon as possible,\u201d said Gao, adding that the central government\u2019s emphasis on energy security empowers local officials further to permit new coal.Hua Wen, a China project director at the Natural Resources Defence Council, notes that the top five provinces that have approved the most new coal power since 2021 \u201care China\u2019s industrial powerhouses and net electricity importers. These provinces are seeking to reduce their reliance on imported electricity to meet their increasing electricity demand [and] to prevent or reduce the risk of future power shortages\u201d.Wen added that some smaller and more inefficient coal power plants have been closed in recent years, partially offsetting the surge in new approvals.Recent policy developments suggest that China is doubling down on coal, even as the rapid construction of green energy infrastructure means that the average annual increase in China\u2019s energy demands can be serviced entirely by low-carbon energy. China\u2019s solar capacity now exceeds the rest of the world combined, but coal still accounts for more than half of total energy consumption.In November, the Chinese government released a long-awaited coal capacity compensation mechanism. The policy, which comes into effect on 1 January, guarantees payments to coal-fired power producers based on their installed capacity. This could incentivise the building of more coal, according to Hove. Other analysts say that the policy will allow more renewables to enter the energy mix without compromising stability.",

        "text": "A virology team has confirmed the first bird flu infections in elephant and fur seals in the sub-Antarctic region, as the highly contagious H5N1 virus continues to spread around the world.Researchers previously reported the mass deaths of seals and that a number of elephant seals on South Georgia island \u2013 a UK overseas territory in the southern Atlantic Ocean \u2013 had been exhibiting symptoms of avian flu. But while seabird cases were confirmed, the seal infections were classed as suspected, pending lab results.The first known cases of H5N1 were detected in the Antarctic region in October among brown skua on Bird Island, off South Georgia. Two months later, hundreds of elephant seals were found dead. There have also been increased deaths of fur seals, kelp gulls and brown skua at several other sites.Marco Falchieri, a scientist in the UK Animal and Plant Health Agency\u2019s (APHA) influenza and avian virology team, which collected the South Georgia samples that tested positive for bird flu. He said he saw about 20 dead elephant seals. \u201cEmotionally it is almost heartbreaking to see so many dead seals.\u201dOther seals were showing respiratory signs of bird flu, he said, citing \u201ccoughs, sneezing, ocular discharge, nasal discharge, slow head shaking and tremors\u201d.Falchieri said the death toll on South Georgia was probably about 100, mainly elephant seals, who appear to be more affected than fur seals.\u201cMy worst fear is an adaptive mutation to mammals, which we are not seeing in these new samples, but we need to keep monitoring,\u201d he said. An adaptive mutation, he added, \u201ccould mean it becomes a mammalian-adapted virus, and consequently increases risk for humans too\u201d.The spillover to the South Georgia mammals is \u201ca reflection of what\u2019s going on globally\u201d, said Ashley Banyard, an APHA virologist. Banyard\u2019s team diagnosed the samples brought back from the island in mid-December.Spillovers occurred, Banyard said, \u201cwhen too many birds have bird flu [and] mammals come into close contact with sick birds\u2019 poo or when the mammals eat [an] infected bird carcass\u201d.In December, the death of a polar bear from bird flu in Alaska was confirmed, and an estimated 20,000 sea lions have died from the virus in Chile and Peru.Mass deaths of elephant seals recorded as bird flu sweeps across the AntarcticRead moreAlthough the sub-Antarctic seal and bird deaths are a concern, Banyard said it was good news that the virus had not spread to other species. \u201cTwo years ago, we were worried about the penguins being infected and dying from the disease in the region, but that has not happened, so this is almost a positive outcome.\u201dIf bird flu continued to spread throughout the sub-Antarctic region, however, he said it \u201ccould significantly threaten the fragile ecosystem, and potentially put a number of very large populations of seabirds and sea mammals at risk\u201d.Norman Ratcliffe, a seabird ecologist with the British Antarctic Survey, said about 98% of the global population of fur seals were found in South Georgia, and that the region hosted \u201cglobally important populations of elephant and fur seals [and these] populations are now at risk from large declines\u201d.Ratcliffe said there was no way to know total seal deaths, either due to deaths at sea or carcasses being scavenged, \u201cbut we know the number of dead is far higher than what we see \u2013 and the mortality is much higher than normal rates for this time of year\u201d.",

        "text": "It takes a special kind of cynicism to assert that long-term planning must have primacy over short-term expediency while defending a policy choice that does the exact opposite. Rishi Sunak\u2019s decision to postpone deadlines for the transition to low-carbon technology is the very definition of tactical partisanship trumping strategic statecraft. That the prime minister sought to present it otherwise in a televised address to the nation on Wednesday shows contempt for anyone who understands the urgency of the climate crisis.The prime minister veils his ploy in economic terms. The claim is that measures designed to accelerate the switch to low-carbon technology \u2013 a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030, for example, and a deadline for phasing out the installation of new gas boilers by 2035 \u2013 heap the cost of transition on consumers. Downing Street insists the commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 stands, but will be reached by \u201cmore proportionate\u201d means.The electoral calculation is that voters can be spooked by the retail price of electric vehicles and low-carbon heating solutions. A campaign can then be fought on the basis that Labour represents eco-fanatics who want to force drivers off the roads, while Tories represent hardworking folk in ordinary cars. The belief that this can work is derived, in part, from the Uxbridge byelection in July, when the plans of London\u2019s Labour mayor for new charges on heavily polluting vehicles were weaponised in a campaign that kept the seat in Conservative hands.There are also examples across Europe of radical rightwing parties mining a backlash against environmental regulation for electoral gain. In the US, hostility to low-carbon measures and outright denial of climate science, suffused with paranoid conspiracy theories, are embedded in the Republican mainstream. Those trends, amplified by funding and lobbying from fossil-fuel industries, have some purchase on British Conservatism but have not thus far dictated the direction of policy.Mr Sunak\u2019s dilution of net zero goals is less extreme but still insidious. In his speech, the prime minister affected continuity with climate change consensus while digging trenches for a new culture war front. His tone was moderate; his agenda was reactionary, divisive and dishonest.As for the prime minister\u2019s economic argument, it is flimsy. The function of ambitious deadlines is to accelerate a transition, creating the market conditions that will supply new technology and drive prices down. That works when there is a stable regulatory climate and confidence that the rules won\u2019t suddenly change, which is why car manufacturers, energy companies and providers of green tech are angry.There is an economic cost of inaction alongside the moral shame of flinching from the climate challenge. Signalling that Britain is a capricious jurisdiction directs investment elsewhere. Countries that move faster in the green transition will sell their expertise to the laggards. Britain does not want to fall behind in that race.The content and manner of the prime minister\u2019s actions indicate a retreat from any ambition to govern seriously, competently and in the spirit of responsible long-term decision-making to which he preposterously lays claim. It is true that Britain needs a government guided by that ethos. Mr Sunak has made it clear that it can\u2019t happen as long as he is in charge.",

Photograph: Richard Osbourne/Norfolk Wildlife TrustThat magic includes a singing nightingale this summer as well as other birds among the 43% of species at risk of extinction in Britain, according to the latest State of Nature report, such as the grasshopper warbler.Other disappearing animals found here include 21 species of butterfly \u2013 80% of Britain\u2019s butterfly species are declining in abundance or distribution \u2013 grass snakes, common lizards and, on the adjacent river, water voles.Scrub that sprang up on Sweet Briar\u2019s mosaic of rough grassland and once-ploughed fields after years of abandonment is providing inadvertent rewilding, and excellent nesting habitat for birds such as blackcaps.But NWT is confident it can balance preserving that scrub with keeping flower-rich grassy glades open by introducing six cows, whose grazing will boost wild flowers such as southern marsh orchid. More than half of Britain\u2019s flowering plants are decline, according to the State of Nature report.The report highlights the importance of ending the fragmentation of wildlife-friendly areas by undertaking large-scale restoration projects such as Cairngorms Connect, which covers 60,000 hectares in the Highlands.Small pockets of land such as Sweet Briar may not make much difference nationally but conservation scientists want to create \u201cbigger, better, more joined-up spaces for wildlife\u201d \u2013 as the Natural England chair, Tony Juniper, said at the State of Nature launch \u2013 by linking small nature hotspots such as Sweet Briar with surrounding areas.Wickens hopes that the new nature reserve will enable NWT to work with surrounding landowners including the city council and Anglian Water to expand this wildlife-nourishing area \u2013 including making two neighbouring parks more nature-friendly \u2013 in a green corridor along the Wensum valley. The charity is also campaigning to stop the Western Link dual-carriageway which is proposed to cross the valley a few miles to the west.Perhaps the most important rarity that Sweet Briar is encouraging is wild children, with NWT working with local schools and refugee groups to bring children on to the reserve to experience its wildlife.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to get one in four people acting for nature [a Wildlife Trusts\u2019 target] we need to reach as big an audience as possible,\u201d said Wickens. \u201cIt\u2019s reaching out to those people who have never been to a nature reserve.

Because we are doing terrorism.\u201d Her terminal cancer diagnosis, the consequence of a childhood growing up in the shadow of an oil refinery, means that Theo is done with tiptoeing around the truth, however unpleasant it might be.Ultimately, these are ordinary people impelled to act by the extraordinary circumstancesThis debate, lubricated by liquor and loosened by night-before nerves, is a pivotal moment that comes some 30 minutes into the film. It\u2019s a scene that concedes that yes, these characters are extremists whose actions will have potentially devastating consequences. But it also takes an empathic view, making the case that, ultimately, these are ordinary people impelled to act by the extraordinary circumstances in which they find themselves. It\u2019s morally complex territory \u2013 the knotty ethical issues that underpin the tautly executed action have some parallels with those of Paradise Now, Hany Abu-Assad\u2019s largely sympathetic portrait of a pair of Palestinian suicide bombers. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Pipeline\u2019s protagonists are scrupulous about targeting infrastructure rather than people. \u201cWe\u2019re not murderers,\u201d stresses Rowan, when her feckless pot-head boyfriend, Logan (Lukas Gage), suggests that anyone who works for an oil company is fair game.It\u2019s an impressively assured second picture from Goldhaber, whose debut film, Cam, achieved minor success on the festival circuit \u2013 a gripping piece of film-making, which deftly weaves the characters\u2019 backstories into a tense account of the plot\u2019s execution. As such, it works on two levels: as a nervy thriller, driven by Gavin Brivik\u2019s pulsing, paranoid score and Tehillah De Castro\u2019s twitchy, restless cinematography; and as a lightning rod for the mounting anger of climate-conscious audiences that feel let down by government inaction on a looming global crisis.It is, however, a film about the act of protest, rather than the impact. The picture is rather hazier when it comes to the consequences of the sabotage, although one character concedes that it will, inevitably, be the poorest members of society that take the hardest hit from a breakdown in the supply chain of fossil fuels. This is one of several areas in which the film comes up short when compared with Kelly Reichardt\u2019s similarly themed but superior Night Moves, an equally tense activist procedural but one that acknowledges that acts of violent protest, however well-planned, can have dire and sometimes deadly ramifications.Watch a trailer for How to Blow Up a Pipeline.This criticism, of a failure to confront the consequences of this mode of protest, has also been aimed at the film\u2019s source material. Goldhaber adapted the screenplay from the nonfiction book of the same name by Andreas Malm, along with co-writers Ariela Barer (who also stars in the film as Xochitl, the ringleader of the group and Theo\u2019s childhood friend) and Jordan Sjol. Malm\u2019s book, which was published in 2021, is critical of non-violence and pacifism in the climate movement, making a case for \u201cintelligent sabotage\u201d rather than protest and mass mobilisation, but, according to some critics, failing to discuss in depth the aftermath of such destructive techniques.Ultimately, however, much of the film\u2019s success comes from its ability to balance the political, theoretical elements of the subject against the more emotional and personal character details. Xochitl\u2019s impotent fury is focused by the death of her mother and by Theo\u2019s terminal diagnosis; Dwayne (Jake Weary), a blue-collar Texan and God-fearing family man, is prompted to act when his family\u2019s land is requisitioned by an oil company; short-fused loner and self-taught explosives expert Michael (Forrest Goodluck) is ready to take his one-man fight against environmental polluters to a wider stage; Shawn (Marcus Scribner) is the relatable everyman, a climate activist who, like many, is despairing at the lack of progress earned by conventional methods. And yes, the character archetypes are a little on the nose at times, but it\u2019s hard to think of another film as emphatically, passionately and furiously of the moment as this one.",

However, whether they would actually be built remained uncertain.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\u201cThis investment is not happening fast enough\u201d for what was \u201cthe biggest energy system transformation since the introduction of electricity itself\u201d, Westerman says in his written speech.\u201cBringing these new projects to market and connecting them into the grid urgently is critical to ensure consumers continue to have reliable power when they need it.\u201dWesterman\u2019s comments echo those of industry groups, such as the Clean Energy Council, which have warned that the influx of new renewables is faltering and could fall far short of the speed required to meet energy demand and the need to reduce emissions from the power sector. Electricity generation is the country\u2019s largest source of carbon pollution.States such as New South Wales have recently announced that their plans to accelerate away from fossil fuels are running behind schedule. Snowy Hydro\u2019s giant 2.0 pumped hydro project, the largest energy project in the country, is also years late and facing much higher costs than originally predicted.Westerman noted that were no new financial commitments on large-scale renewable energy generation signed in the first quarter of 2023. Only a single storage plant secured investment support.\u201cOne quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, but investment decisions are an important leading indicator for our energy transition,\u201d he said.Aemo was working to support 163 projects with 27GW of capacity in eastern Australia that were at various stages of connection. Securing approval from local communities for the new projects and the power lines linking them was one of the main challenges.\u201cThis situation has been framed in fairly oppositional terms: city versus country; business versus community, infrastructure versus agriculture, David versus Goliath,\u201d Westerman said.\u201cLandowners in these communities that host transmission towers should be fairly compensated.\u201dVictoria and NSW have been offering landholders payments over time of $200,000 per kilometre for power lines on their properties and Queensland as much as $300,000.Australia needs to reduce emissions to net zero by 2038 to do \u2018fair share\u2019 to contain global heating, analysis showsRead moreWhile large-scale plants will need to increase nine-fold by 2050, rooftop solar is projected to expand five times to reach two in three homes by then.Rooftop solar already amounted to 15GW of capacity in eastern states, or about a quarter of the total.\u201cBut as the operator who is accountable for system security, huge amounts of rooftop solar can sometimes be a challenge because it is largely invisible and doesn\u2019t yet respond to either market or operational signals,\u201d Westerman said.More was also needed to be done to improve energy efficiency so less energy was required in the first place. Australia ranked 18th out of 25 nations on the efficient use of energy, lagging countries such as India and Indonesia, he said.Storage, too, was another challenge. The grid now has about 2GW of capacity in the form of batteries or pumped hydro, a scale that will need to expand 30-fold by 2050.",

This means it will be difficult to grow certain vegetables and yields could be affected. Last year, yields on crops such as cabbage and kale were reduced because of the drought.The National Drought Group has warned that England is one hot, dry spell away from severe drought conditions returning in 2023. Two areas \u2013 East Anglia and Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly \u2013 are still in official \u201cdrought\u201d status, with the remainder now \u201crecovering\u201d. East Anglia is where a large proportion of England\u2019s crops, which require irrigation, are grown.Asda and Morrisons ration fresh produce including tomatoes and peppersRead moreSupermarkets have rationed sales of produce, including tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, broccoli and lettuce, owing to volatile growing conditions elsewhere in Europe, including drought. Soaring energy costs also mean glasshouses are going out of business.Last year, hosepipe bans were put in place across England because of drought conditions and water companies considered taking more drastic measures such as banning the filling of public swimming pools, washing cars and cleaning non-domestic buildings.February has been dry so far, with low rainfall across England since the end of January \u2013 meaning 63% of rivers are below normal levels for this time of year. Some storage reservoirs are still lower than anticipated and groundwater levels in Norfolk are only beginning to rise slowly.Members of the National Drought Group, which includes water companies, the Met Office and government agencies, are planning for the worst case scenario of another hot, dry spell this summer and are managing water resources, including having emergency abstraction licences on standby for farmers who need to irrigate.Minette Batters, the president of the National Farmers\u2019 Union, highlighted the issue of drought hitting farmers at NFU\u2019s annual conference in Birmingham.Calling on ministers to take urgent action on food security, she said 2022 had been \u201cthe year that the potential impact of climate change really hit home.\u201cThe extraordinary temperatures we experienced in July \u2013 exceeding 40 degrees \u2013 topped the previous record by almost a degree and a half.

        "text": "Cuts to post-Brexit farming payments mean farms risk \u201cgoing out of business\u201d as new figures reveal only a tiny fraction of a new scheme designed to replace lost subsidies went to agriculture businesses last year.The government is replacing the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which paid subsidies to farmers to keep them in business, with \u201cpayments for public goods\u201d, meaning land managers get paid for improving nature.Each year, ministers are cutting how much farmers get paid under the old scheme while they introduce new ones, which last year commenced with the launch of the sustainable farming incentive (SFI). This paid farmers for looking after their soil.While subsidies were cut by an average of 22% for farmers last year, the money paid out through the SFI equated to only 0.44% of the total funding plan for farmers, leaving farmers asking where the money is going. This year, the cuts are set to be even more stark, with the government planning to slash payments by 36%.Data revealed to the Observer under the Freedom of Information Act from the Rural Payments Agency shows that a total of \u00a310,692,415 was paid out under the sustainable farming incentive scheme in the 2022 calendar year. This is out of a budget of \u00a32.4bn, meaning only 0.44% was spent on the new schemes.Farmers have said they are noticing an underspend, with money missing from the rural community. Jake Fiennes, a conservationist who manages a large farm on the Holkham Estate, Norfolk, saw the farm\u2019s subsidies cut by about 45% last year.\u201cIn the last financial year, there was an underspend of about \u00a3100m. It looks like this is to be the case again. Our direct support has been reduced and we want to know where that money is going,\u201d he said.Dither and delay over introducing the new payment programme, including threats from the Liz Truss government that they would scrap it altogether, meant that many farmers have not signed up.\u201cThese figures show that the Conservatives have broken their promise to farmers to keep farm funding at CAP levels,\u201d said Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson. \u201cThey have rushed to cut basic payments and failed to deliver the new schemes on time.\u201cThis will lead to farmers going out of business, which means that we will fail to deliver vital environmental goals.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know if this is incompetence or deliberate betrayal of our rural communities, but they amount to the same thing.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An earlier version said farmers received \u201cless than 0.5% of post-Brexit money\u201d last year; this intended to convey that the money paid out via the SFI scheme equated to 0.5% of the overall \u00a32.4bn agricultural support budget, of which the SFI forms one part. The article text was also amended for greater clarity on this point. Payments in the form of direct subsidies, which are another part of the overall budget, totalled \u00a31.65bn last year, following a 22% cut on previous subsidy levels.",

It also asks investors to support all climate-linked shareholder resolutions, particularly those that call for an end to new fossil fuel projects.A spokesperson for the University of Sussex said: \u201cOur academics have identified new fossil fuel projects as a key threat to meeting critical global climate targets, including limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees. Asset managers, who hold trillions in investments on behalf of their clients, have a key role to play in stewarding the world\u2019s economy away from fossil fuels.\u201dThe latest call for a revolt against the fossil fuel industry has emerged as Shell braces for what is expected to be one of its most hostile annual meetings in London after fierce climate protests in recent weeks that have disrupted the AGMs held by BP, Barclays and Drax.Leading investment funds, proxy advisers and activist shareholders are preparing to take Shell to task for failing to outline a business strategy that aligns with the Paris climate agreement.The company\u2019s chair, Sir Andrew Mackenzie, will face calls to be ousted from the board by the Church of England Pensions Board, Britain\u2019s Local Authorities Pension Funds Forum and the UK\u2019s biggest workplace pensions manager, Nest.Shareholder advisers at PIRC and USS have also recommended that shareholders vote against the reappointment of Mackenzie, or other board members, to protest against what they view as insufficient progress on the energy transition.The same funds have also backed an activist shareholder resolution from the Dutch climate campaign group Follow This, which is calling for oil companies to set a strategy that aligns with the goal of limiting global heating to within 1.5C of pre-industrialised levels enshrined in the Paris climate agreement.For the first time, Follow This has won the support of investors that are leading the world\u2019s largest climate-focused investor group Climate Action 100+ in its engagement with Shell. The Dutch funds PGGM and MN are expected to call on the investors within the Climate Action 100+, which represents $68tn (\u00a354.6tn) in assets, to vote in favour of the resolution.The Follow This campaign has been emboldened by concerns among ethical investors that the oil giant may be preparing to water down its commitments to reduce fossil fuel production in order to take advantage of soaring global energy prices.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The study, from the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), based on extensive interviews with consumers, found widespread misunderstandings around common terms such as \u201cbiodegradable\u201d, \u201ccompostable\u201d and \u201crecyclable\u201d, leaving participants angry when they discovered what they meant.According to the ASA, households in the UK take pride in recycling and food-waste management, and hope to play their part in preventing the destruction of nature by putting rubbish into correct bins or buying products with green packaging.However, some participants in the new research believed the labelling meant that packaging would disappear entirely or decompose. Some of those surveyed were surprised to learn that \u201cbiodegradable\u201d packaging has an unlimited timeframe to break down and could produce toxins.Many \u201ccompostable\u201d products need to be taken to a specialist waste centre and would not break down in a household compost bin, although many of those surveyed believed the products could be composted at home.\u2018It\u2019s greenwash\u2019: most home compostable plastics don\u2019t work, says studyRead moreMiles Lockwood, director of complaints and investigations at the ASA, said the regulator would be cracking down on the use of the terms in adverts as part of its action on greenwashing.\u201cConsumers were telling us that they were proud of what they were doing on the environment. They have green bins, they were separating things out, they were doing their bit for the environment and it made them feel good.\u201cWhen we began to explain the differences between recycling in the home or recycling in a centre, it created a sense of depression or disappointment at what is happening,\u201d said Lockwood.\u201cPeople assume because it\u2019s \u2018compostable\u2019, they can put it into their garden compost bin. When you explain that you can\u2019t and it\u2019s not going to compost without being taken to a council facility, it generated a really negative response,\u201d he said.\u201cWith the issue of biodegradability, there is no definition of what makes something biodegradable. It can take years and sometimes degrade into microplastics \u2013 that created a real sense of disappointment and anger. Businesses need to work a lot harder to explain the difference.\u201dPrevious studies have shown that most plastics marketed as \u201chome compostable\u201d do not work, with as many as 60% failing to disintegrate after six months. Pollution is a leading driver of biodiversity loss and waste is a significant source of methane emissions.\u2018Compostable\u2019 plastic bags often will not decompose in a home compost heap, and must be handled in a council facility. Photograph: Angela Hampton Picture Library/AlamyIn recent years, the ASA has banned ads that it felt misled consumers on the climate crisis and the destruction of nature. In 2022, the ASA banned a Lipton Ice Tea advert for giving the impression that the bottle was made from entirely recycled materials when the cap and label were not.It has previously upheld complaints about baby wipes and dog poo bags over their biodegradability claims, and promised to ban claims of \u201ccarbon neutrality\u201d using offsets, amid concerns that many offsets have no benefit to the climate.The ASA research also showed how participants routinely believed environmental claims in advertising, assuming that brands would not be able to make claims without verification or evidence, particularly when a company made a claim using statistics. Those surveyed said they wanted clear information about what was in products, where it would be disposed, how long that would take and what the outcome of the disposal would be.The report comes against a backdrop of tighter restrictions on green claims in advertising. Last week, the ASA banned two Toyota adverts for condoning driving that disregards its environmental impact, stating that the SUV ads had been created without \u201ca sense of responsibility to society\u201d.Greenwashing era is over, say ad agencies, as regulators get toughRead more\u201cBusiness are trying to get it right but they often make really silly mistakes. Half the time we see companies who are a bit too enthusiastic, who are a bit too broad brush and a bit vague, who don\u2019t walk consumers through a journey with them. They make assumptions about what consumers know,\u201d said Lockwood.\u201cWe have been focusing a lot on cases around oil and gas, airlines and banks and so on. We are calling time in those sectors on companies making \u2018green halo claims\u2019, where they just focus on the green bits of what they do and ignore the rest,\u201d he said.\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features\n",

Now a study suggests similar labelling on food could help them make wiser choices about not just their health, but the health of the planet.The research, by academics at Durham University, found that warning labels including a graphic image \u2013 similar to those warning of impotence, heart disease or lung cancer on cigarette packets \u2013 could reduce selections of meals containing meat by 7-10%.It is a change that could have a material impact on the future of the planet. According to a recent YouGov poll, 72% of the UK population classify themselves as meat-eaters. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC), which advises the government on its net zero goals, has said the UK needs to slash its meat consumption by 20% by 2030, and 50% by 2050, in order to meet them.Jack Hughes, a PhD candidate who led the Durham study, said: \u201cWhen you combine that [CCC advice] with the fact that high meat intake is linked to lots of health issues, and the way that we currently farm, or certainly some of the most common ways of farming, are also very heavily linked to the potential of pandemic outbreaks, it becomes clear that there are multiple reasons why the current way that we eat meat is maybe not the best way to do it.\u201dRevealed: the industry figures behind \u2018declaration of scientists\u2019 backing meat eatingRead moreHughes and colleagues split 1,001 meat-eating adults into four groups, and showed each group pictures of hot meat, fish, vegetarian and vegan canteen-style meals \u2013 ranging from burgers to quiche \u2013 with either a health warning label, a climate warning label, a pandemic warning label, or no label at all.Pandemic warnings proved the most effective at dissuading participants from eating the meat options, reducing choices of them by 10%, followed by health warnings at 8.8%, then climate warnings at 7.4% \u2013 but researchers said the differences were not statistically significant, and that participants had judged the climate warnings to be the most credible.Researchers believe their findings could help encourage changes in gastronomic choices that could ultimately benefit the environment. \u201cReaching net zero is a priority for the nation and the planet,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cAs warning labels have already been shown to reduce smoking as well as drinking of sugary drinks and alcohol, using a warning label on meat-containing products could help us achieve this if introduced as national policy.\u201dThe study is published in the journal Appetite.",

        "text": "Replanting logged tropical forests with a diverse mixture of seedlings can help them regrow more quickly than allowing trees to regenerate naturally, a study has shown.Satellite observations of one of the largest ecological experiments in the world in the Malaysian state of Sabah have revealed how lowland rainforest recovered over a decade.After trees were felled in the 1980s, the publicly owned Malua Forest Reserve was dedicated to learning how best to restore tropical forests. A 500-hectare (1,235-acre) study site was divided into 125 experimental plots that, in 2002-03, were either left to recover naturally or planted with a mixture of one, four or 16 native tree species.By 2012, the plots replanted with a mixture of 16 native tree species showed a quicker recovery of canopy area and total tree biomass, compared with areas replanted with four or only a single native species. But even plots replanted with just one tree species recovered more quickly after 10 years than those left to naturally regenerate.A river runs through a rainforest in Sabah, Malaysia. Photograph: Genevieve Vallee/AlamyProf Andrew Hector, of the University of Oxford, who set up the experiment more than 20 years ago as part of the South East Asia Rainforest Research Partnership (SEARRP), said: \u201cOur new study demonstrates that replanting logged tropical forests with diverse mixtures of native tree species achieves multiple wins, accelerating the restoration of tree cover, biodiversity, and important ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration.\u201dThe researchers, who published their findings in the journal Science Advances, said that the probable reason for the better recovery was that different tree species occupied distinct niches within the forest ecosystem and so diverse mixtures of planted species complemented each other and increased the effective functioning of the whole ecosystem. For instance, some tropical species were more tolerant of drought because they produced more protective chemicals, giving the forest resilience during periods of low rainfall.Hector added: \u201cHaving diversity in a tropical forest can be likened to an insurance effect, similar to having a financial strategy of diverse investment portfolios.\u201dTropical forests cover 6% of the planet\u2019s land surface but are home to about 80% of the world\u2019s documented species and are major carbon sinks. Between 2004 and 2017, 43m hectares of tropical forest were destroyed, an area the size of Morocco.Restoring forests that have been logged is a crucial part of tackling the climate and extinction crises but it is debatable whether this is best achieved through allowing forests to restore themselves via seeds in the soil or through active replanting.The Sabah biodiversity experiment planted nearly 100,000 trees, including several endangered species and the world\u2019s tallest tropical tree, Shorea faguetiana or yellow meranti, which can reach more than 100 metres in height.The recovery of the plots was assessed by applying statistical models to aerial images captured by satellites.Ryan Veryard, the lead author of the study, said: \u201cImportantly, our results show that logged forest can recover so long as it is not converted to agricultural uses like oil palm plantation. They also emphasise the need to conserve biodiversity within undisturbed forests, so that we can restore it in areas that have already been logged.\u201d",

No river in England passes tests for chemical or biological pollution, and government targets to improve the water quality in rivers will not be met.\u201cImprovements to wastewater plants should be implemented along with more regulations. These efforts are crucial in safeguarding the integrity and safety of our rivers \u2013 fundamental elements of both ecosystems and human wellbeing,\u201d said the lead author, Dr Dania Albini, of Oxford\u2019s biology department.Treated sewage released by water companies into rivers and raw effluent that is dumped in rivers via storm overflows is the primary driver of increased nutrients, algae and sewage fungus in rivers, according to the study.Sewage discharge radically alters plant, animal and microbe communities and increases the abundance of harmful species. While runoff from farmland has negative impacts on river water quality, the research reveals that sewage discharge into rivers has a greater impact on water quality and the animals and plants that live in rivers.The findings were published in the journals Global Change Biology and Ecological Solutions and Evidence.Albini said: \u201cOur study highlights the disproportionate impact that sewage discharge has on river quality, presenting an urgent need for a comprehensive action plan targeting the sewage discharge problem.\u201dSewage from households and businesses is treated by water companies at treatment plants and then discharged into rivers. Raw sewage is also discharged via storm overflows, but this should only take place in exceptional circumstances. Water companies are at the centre of a criminal investigation by the Environment Agency and an inquiry by the financial regulator Ofwat into failures in the way they run their treatment plants.James Wallace, of the UK-based charity River Action, said: \u201cThis important research demonstrates yet again the damage from unregulated water companies and agriculture. In addition to the catastrophic impact on wildlife from nutrient pollution, the public should be aware that sewage systems do not remove dangerous bacteria such as E.coli and intestinal enterococci from treated sewage.\u201cWhen will the government make water companies and farms clean up their act, especially in places where human lives and sensitive protected habitats are threatened?\u201dSeparate research by Dr Leon Barron, part of the Environmental Research Group at Imperial College, which involved hundreds of samples taken from 14 waterways in Greater London over three years, reveals that 21 compounds were detected that posed a potential risk to the environment in freshwater ecosystems. The pollutants included antibiotics, pain medication and pet parasite medications, which contain neonicotinoids.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Last weekend, air pollution in London reached the top value of 10 on the UK government\u2019s index. Greatest concentrations were measured in the southwestern suburbs. This was London\u2019s worst air pollution since January 2017.These short episodes of air pollution have an impact. A five-year study of 1.2 million Londoners published in 2021 found a rise in GP respiratory consultations and inhaler prescriptions after short increases in air pollution. This was more pronounced in children and persisted for at least a week.Home wood burning played a large role in the pollution peaks last weekend, according to data from Imperial College London on the chemical composition of the particle pollution in London, especially during the evenings. Analysis of the soot particles that Londoners were breathing showed that between 60% and 70% came from wood or solid fuel heating. Averaged over the whole year, home fires in the UK produce more particle pollution than the exhaust of all traffic on our roads.And yet enforcement and control remains ineffective. Dr James Heydon, of the University of Nottingham, has been researching the way in which the legal controls on home fires have failed to address this problem. These laws include smoke control areas (SCAs) or smokeless zones that were devised in the 1950s and cover most UK cities. In these areas, people who burn solid fuel have to use a certified appliance or burn smokeless fuel. In an SCA, burning wood on an open fire is illegal.Heydon\u2019s research included freedom of information requests to local councils and interviews with council staff. A sample of 30 councils revealed 2,524 complaints about chimney smoke between 2014 and 2020. Despite this volume of complaints, only two councils had taken court action, a total of four cases over six years.Heydon said: \u201cThere are myriad of practical difficulties, including responding to complaints out of hours, being able to see \u2018smoke\u2019 at night, and gathering enough evidence to determine its origin from an \u2018uncertified\u2019 source. These problems are compounded by recent efforts at making enforcement easier.\u201dLaws should not have to be enforced by court action to be effective but adherence requires people to know about them. A survey conducted for Defra found that 46% of stove users in SCAs did not know if their solid fuel stove was approved for use. One in 10 people burning wood in SCAs knew that their stove was not approved. This points to a need for better public information.Wood and solid fuel is the most polluting way to heat a home, especially with an open fire. An outdated set of rules along with poor information and enforcement may have allowed home heating with wood and solid fuel to become normalised behaviour. Without more action, it will be very difficult for the UK to meet future targets to reduce air pollution.",

        "text": "Italy\u2019s rivers and lakes are facing another year of severe drought after a winter of little rain and snowfall, raising the alarm on the implications for farming, hydropower and access to drinking water.Vast areas of the Po \u2013 the country\u2019s longest river that nourishes several northern and central regions \u2013 are already parched, while the water level on Lake Garda is the lowest during winter in 35 years.Unusually lower water levels in Venice have dried up the lagoon city\u2019s canals, leaving gondolas stranded.Italy\u2019s National Research Council (CNR) said rainfall in the north was down 40% in 2022 and the absence of precipitation since the beginning of 2023 had been significant.In particular, the Po, which stretches from the Alps in the north-west and flows through the Po delta before reaching the Adriatic, faces a repeat of last year\u2019s drought \u2013 the worst to affect the waterway in seven decades \u2013 unless rain arrives in the spring. In the Pavia area of the Po valley the water level is 3 metres below the zero gauge, turning the riverbanks into beaches \u2013 a phenomenon usually seen in summer.\u201cNothing has changed since 2022,\u201d said Luca Mercalli, the president of the Italian Meteorological Society. \u201cWe are still in a situation of deficit \u2026 let\u2019s wait for the spring, which is usually the rainiest period for the Po valley. There is a good possibility that rainfall in April and May can compensate \u2013 it\u2019s the last hope. If we have no spring rain for two consecutive years then it would be the first time this has ever happened.\u201dThe Po also flows through Emilia-Romagna and Veneto, one of the most important agricultural zones in Europe. Along with 2022, during which there was a protracted heatwave, the valley experienced droughts in 2007, 2012 and 2017, and scientists say their growing prevalence is a further indication of the climate crisis.Coldiretti, Italy\u2019s biggest farmers\u2019 association, said the 2022 drought caused \u20ac6bn (\u00a35.4bn) worth of damage to agricultural produce. It warned that a third of production was at risk this year unless another long and severe drought was averted.Alessandro Bratti, the president of the Po basin authority, said the situation was most extreme in Piedmont and Lombardy, while in Trentino it was affecting the production of hydroelectric power.\u201cIf you have no water you cannot produce energy, so this is another problem,\u201d Bratti said. \u201cIt is very critical because it hasn\u2019t snowed or rained during this period and the forecast says it will stay this way.\u201dWith the Po\u2019s level so low, an additional problem is that sea water encroaches further up the river, filling aquifers and making them unusable for irrigating farmland.\u201cLast year sea water entered for almost 40km [25 miles], which also causes a problem for drinking water as you need to use desalinators,\u201d said Bratti.Last summer, the Italian government, which at the time was led by Mario Draghi, released \u20ac36.5m of funds to help areas affected by the drought. The move also allowed local authorities to bypass the usual bureaucracy and take immediate action, such as by imposing water rationing measures.Although the measures were coordinated by the Po basin authority, the body only has the power to advise, such as suggesting ways farmers can use less water.\u201cThere are many entities involved and the protocol at the moment is voluntary,\u201d said Bratti. \u201cThere needs to be a law that gives the basin authority the power to work out the problem and decide what to do \u2013 it could be telling farmers to stop drawing water for a month or stopping hydroelectric power for a week.\u201dHe said the funds issued by the Draghi administration were still in place but that projects to tackle drought situations had been slow to progress since the new government led by Giorgia Meloni came to power in October.\u201cWe have projects and funds for hydrological infrastructure, such as building barriers to prevent the sea from entering the river,\u201d Bratti added. \u201cThere is also a proposal to build 10,000 lakes, and to introduce technical systems to cut down the waste of water in farming. We now need to accelerate the projects.\u201d",

We\u2019ve exercised every option, we\u2019ve made every argument that we can, and Princeton hasn\u2019t taken it seriously,\u201d she said.Reynolds accused the university of stalling by having various panels and committees review divestment proposals, only to see them recommend contradictory actions that limit the scale of action. Last year, Princeton\u2019s board of trustees announced it would divest from coal and tar sands but not oil and gas.Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. Photograph: Harrison McClary/ReutersAaditi Lele, an organiser of the divestment campaign at Vanderbilt University, said students there faced a similar struggle.\u201cEvery time we ask them about fossil fuel divestment, they refer back to other actions that they\u2019re taking to make the campus itself greener, such as carbon offsets, but they fail to address actual divestment. A lot of what they do is just greenwashing through mentioning those other actions and then using that as justification to pretend that that\u2019s enough,\u201d she said.Students at the five universities coordinated their action following similar initiatives Harvard and Cornell, which both subsequently announced they would shed fossil fuel investments.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen other schools, specifically Harvard and Cornell, take the same approach,\u201d said Reynolds. \u201cWithin months, both of those schools have divested. So our hope is that by taking this action, that maybe this will finally be taken seriously.\u201dThe students are also seeking to put pressure on their universities by drawing public attention to their continued financial involvement with the coal, oil and gas industries.Asked why the student groups asked state attorneys general to investigate instead of pursuing direct legal action, Reynolds said it was a question of resources.\u201cPrinceton is a university with a $39bn endowment, so they really have a lot of resources that we don\u2019t have. I\u2019m sure that they would be able to hire the lawyers to defend them in a way that would be much more difficult for us. We don\u2019t have any funding or anything. It\u2019s a bunch of volunteers in our campaign,\u201d she said.Four of the universities are in states with Democratic attorneys general and their students expect at least a sympathetic hearing. Vanderbilt is in Tennessee, where Slatery is a Republican. But campaigners note that he declined to join 27 other states in a lawsuit against President Barack Obama\u2019s policies to mitigate the climate crisis.Lele said the environmental crisis had not passed Tennessee by. The state was hit by catastrophic flash flooding last year that killed 20 people and damaged hundreds of homes.\u201cEnvironmental degradation and its impacts have really been at the forefront of the conversation. So we\u2019re hopeful that the political affiliations of the state don\u2019t impede their understandings of the gravity of the situation,\u201d she said.",

The highest median levels were found in Lake Michigan and Lake Ontario.Though myriad microplastic sources exist, wastewater treatment plants seem to be a major Great Lakes basin contributor, as they are elsewhere, Hataley said. Pollution from microfibers that come off clothing in washing machines are thought to be another common source, as are preproduction plastic pellets used in manufacturing. She noted concerning levels of microplastics have been found in sport fish consumed by humans and beer brewed with Great Lakes water.But the consequences for human health are unknown, Hataley said.\u201cWe know we are being exposed, but what that means in terms of harm or what\u2019s a safe level \u2013 we have no idea, and that\u2019s going to take more research,\u201d she said.Getting a handle on the question starts with the US and Canadian governments coordinating the monitoring of microplastic levels, she added, and the nations\u2019 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement already has in place monitoring programs for other pollutants.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The fossils, dating back to the Cambrian period \u2013 538m to 485m years ago \u2013 are microscopic, roughly the width of a human hair, and lived in the ocean back when there was no life on land.Tom Harvey, from Leicester University, discovered them in rocks he had collected from a logging trail in Newfoundland, Canada, which he was examining using a microscope to search for animal skin. Instead, he came across a cluster of spiny objects stuck together in neat geometric clusters.They were unlike anything he\u2019d seen before. \u201cThe cells were quite big, they formed quite a large colony that has this amazing geometry,\u201d he says. They reminded him of the pattern of butterfly eggs laid on a cabbage leaf, but he had no idea what he was looking at. \u201cIt was just too mysterious,\u201d Harvey says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even want to hazard a guess.\u201dA quarry in Newfoundland, Canada, where the fossils were found. Photograph: University of LeicesterIt was years before he found more of these microfossils. The process involves dissolving rocks in powerful acid, leaving carbon-based fossils intact, floating in a watery residue. Harvey then uses a microscope to search each drop of liquid, and suck up individual clusters of cells with an eyedropper. Eventually, he had a collection of a few dozen similar-looking fossils.Childhood memories were stirred of pond dipping and examining pond water under a microscope, giving Harvey the idea that his new fossils \u2013 although found on land \u2013 could be phytoplankton.The discovery is published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B , which describes fossils shaped like little flat plates and rings, just one cell thick; the closest match Harvey could find today are algae that live in ponds and lakes.Harvey believes that, judging by their neat, symmetrical shapes, these colonies formed in a similar way to some living freshwater phytoplankton: rather than dividing into ever bigger blobs of cells, the parent plankton cells split off daughter colonies in a single step, then let them go.Discovered in the deep: the squid that sees both ways at onceRead moreLiving phytoplankton do this when they sense animals nearby. Chemicals wafting through the water from grazing creatures, such as water fleas, stimulate the plankton to divide and become spinier, which makes them more difficult to eat.Harvey thinks the ancient phytoplankton may have done the same thing. If he\u2019s right, then this is the earliest evidence that animals had begun filtering seawater for phytoplankton, a critical part of the way ocean ecosystems work today.The discovery could help fill a huge gap in the fossil record for phytoplankton. The main varieties living in the ocean now can be traced to only about 200 to 100m years ago, during the time of the dinosaurs, compared with Harvey\u2019s fossils, which are about 510m years old.00:01:17Scientists discover why thousands of octopuses huddle in a deep-sea crevice \u2013 videoHoards of microfossils date back earlier in Earth\u2019s history but remain stubbornly enigmatic. Palaeontologists call them \u201cacritarchs\u201d, but don\u2019t know what they were. Some could be cells broken from phytoplankton colonies similar to those that Harvey has found. He hopes his fossils could help other palaeontologists identify more of these colonies by showing them what to look for.\u201cI think they\u2019ll be out there on microscope slides and collections in museums all around the world,\u201d he says. This article was amended on 9 November 2023 to clarify the type of plankton that this discovery could help.",

One in four homes with gas cookers breached hourly pollution levels set by the World Health Organization, while none of the homes in the control group, which used electric cookers, broke the limits.Piet Jacobs, a scientist from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, said: \u201cChanging to electric cooking \u2013 preferably combined with use of well-designed ventilation hoods to reduce exposure to high levels of particulate matter from cooking \u2013 can bring these values down to below recommended levels.\u201dBurning gas to cook food releases pollutants such as NO2 that hurt lungs and inflame airways. Scientists have long known of an association between gas cookers and childhood asthma, though they have not proved a causal link between the two.Indoor wood burning raises women\u2019s lung cancer risk by 43%, says US studyRead moreThe report, which was commissioned by the energy efficiency group Clasp, measured indoor NO2 levels in seven European countries. The scientists chose homes in which people did not smoke, and that were far from busy roads and factories, to reduce the effect of other sources of pollution.They found pollution spikes could last several hours and were more intense the longer people cooked. On average, the WHO daily limit for NO2 pollution was breached for 3.25 days over the 13-day testing period.\u201cThis is a key study that will facilitate raising awareness and triggering action that will protect the health of those most vulnerable, like our children,\u201d said Juana Mar\u00eda Delgado-Saborit, the head of the environmental health research lab at Jaume I University in Spain, who served as an external reviewer for the study.She said the biggest limitation of the study was that the researchers had to use sensors, which did not perform as well as the scientific instruments used to measure air quality in laboratories or outdoors. To counter this, they calibrated the sensors before and after installing them in each home, she said.\u201cI have seen the evidence from their quality assurance programme and I am confident that the researchers have used sound methods,\u201d said Delgado-Saborit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Filmed over the course of three years, the five-part series aims to shine a light on the challenges affecting the British Isles and celebrate nature that exists on our doorsteps.But according to the show\u2019s producer, filming on physically demanding terrain \u2013 including on the island of Skomer, off the west coast of Wales \u2013 meant plans had to be changed at the last minute to avoid seriously risking the 96-year-old\u2019s health.\u201cThe shearwaters are not great at taking off, so what the warden on the island said is, \u2018If you sit David close to the burrows, they will almost certainly climb up his arm on to his head and take off from his head\u2019,\u201d Alastair Fothergill told the Radio Times. \u201cWe thought, \u2018Wow, that could be TV gold\u2019.

In Britain, the disease has had a growing impact on wild birds over the past two years with 65 species being infected.Wild Isles will be Attenborough\u2019s first time in front of the camera on location since The Green Planet, which was filmed four years ago. The preparation for the series was incredible demanding, and Attenborough was even accompanied by a doctor with a defibrillator each time he made the climb up the 68 steep concrete steps from the landing jetty to the top of Skomer Island, Radio Times reported.The broadcaster got in shape by repeated trips up and down the 22 stairs that connect the hallway with the study at his home in Richmond, Surrey.In total, the Wild Isles crew filmed in 145 locations and 96 species, which took 1,631 days to film. Other locations Attenborough visited during filming included Old Harry Rocks in Dorset and Richmond Park.Although his family and insiders have said he is not retiring, he is understood to have stopped travelling internationally.Speaking to the Observer, Fothergill said Attenborough agreed to narrate Wild Isles from the start and was later approached about presenting it. \u201cWe felt he had a unique perspective because of his age, on how the British countryside has changed in his lifetime,\u201d he said.\u201cHe introduces every episode and closes the opening and last episode with very powerful pieces about the fact that, as this is our home, it is our responsibility to try to restore nature.\u201d",

That could mean trouble not just for people but for some of the region\u2019s plants, too.Residents across the sprawling metro are finding the extended extreme heat has led to fried flora. Nurseries and landscapers are inundated with requests for help with saguaros or fruit trees that are losing leaves.Phones have been \u201cringing nonstop\u201d about everything from a cactus to a citrus tree or ficus, said Sophia Booth, a landscape designer at Moon Valley Nursery. \u201cA lot of people are calling and saying their cactus is yellowing really hard, fell over or like broken arms, that sort of thing. Twenty-year-old trees are losing all their leaves, or they\u2019re turning a crisp brown.\u201dAt the Desert Botanical Garden, three of the treasured institution\u2019s more than 1,000 saguaro cactuses have toppled over or lost an arm in the last week, a rate that officials there say is highly unusual.These saguaros, a towering trademark of the Sonoran Desert landscape, were already stressed from record-breaking heat three years ago, and this summer\u2019s historic heat \u2013 the average temperature in Phoenix last month was 102.7F (39.3C) \u2013 turned out to be the cactus needle that broke the camel\u2019s back.Saguaros can live up to 200 years and grow as tall as 40ft (12 meters). Some in the Desert Botanical Garden date beyond its opening 85 years ago, and the largest there measure almost 30ft (9 meters), according to Kimberlie McCue, the garden\u2019s chief science officer.People commonly assume that cactuses are made to endure scorching heat, but even they can have their limits, McCue said. It wasn\u2019t just this summer\u2019s 31-day streak of highs at or above 110F (43.3C), but also the multiple nights when the low never dipped below 90F (32.2C). Night-time is when cactuses open their pores to get rid of retained water and take in carbon dioxide, she explained.There is hope that the arrival of thunderstorms during the monsoon season, which traditionally starts on 15 June, could bring more delayed moisture that will help struggling flora.In Arizona, about half the rain that falls during the year comes during the monsoon. It can be a mixed bag \u2013 cooling sweltering cities like Las Vegas and Phoenix but bringing the risk of flooding to mountain towns and low-lying deserts alike. It carries a promise of rain but doesn\u2019t always deliver. And even when it does, the moisture isn\u2019t shared equally across the Four Corners region and beyond. The last two seasons were impressive, and the two before that largely duds.As of Wednesday, there was no rain in the forecast for Phoenix anytime soon according to the National Weather Service. After two days of a slight drop, high temperatures reached 111F (43.9C) and are expected to be 110F or more for the next 10 days.The Weather Service plans to issue an extreme heat warning Friday through Monday, when the highs will be between 111F (43.9C) and 117F (47.2C).skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "The development economist Michael Lipton, who has died aged 86, credited an important part of his education to the people of the village of Kavathe in Maharashtra state, India. His research there in 1965-66 anchored a lifetime devoted to understanding, explaining and advocating for poor rural people around the world.Rather than being backward and conservative as some supposed, such communities acted rationally and managed resources efficiently. In his paper The Theory of the Optimising Peasant (1968), Michael explained that poor, small farmers were often reluctant to adopt new varieties of wheat and rice such as those rolled out in the green revolution of the mid-20th century, despite the average yield being higher than that of traditional varieties. This was because when the new varieties failed, because of drought or disease, they did so more spectacularly than traditional varieties, and thus increased the risk of hunger and destitution. When later generations of the green revolution crops reduced the risk, poor farmers adopted them with enthusiasm.Michael also showed that in land-scarce situations, poor farmers managed the land more intensively and more efficiently than richer ones; and he debunked the idea that poor farmers were wasteful, showing that grain losses on farms were often minimal.These ideas helped overturn the idea that national development could only come via industrialisation, at the expense, usually via high taxation, of rural areas. Michael\u2019s big book, Why Poor People Stay Poor: Urban Bias and World Development (1977), set out to map in detail the ways in which urban-focused elites and policymakers discriminated against the rural poor.In other work, Michael crossed the boundaries of disciplines to explore the linkages between agriculture, health and nutrition. In a short book for the World Health Organisation with Emanuel de Kadt, Agriculture-Health Linkages (1988), the authors demonstrated how the health and nutrition of rural people were shaped by agricultural policy: what was grown, at what price, and where. They showed how to make agricultural policymaking and institutions more responsive to the health needs of poor people, especially women, in rural areas.Michael\u2019s interest in development economics was sparked by Paul Streeten at Oxford, and by research for Gunnar Myrdal, author of what eventually became Asian Drama: An Inquiry Into the Poverty of Nations (1968). In 1966 he married Merle Babrow, a historian and political analyst from South Africa, and they shared a long-term interest in rural development and social change there.The countries he advised included India and Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Sudan, Botswana and South Africa. He worked with banks, aid agencies and foundations, and in 2001 was the main author of the first Rural Poverty report for the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Characteristic of his initiatives were market-based approaches to land reform in southern Africa, seeking to overturn the historic inequity of land appropriation by colonial interests while avoiding violent conflict.Born in London, Michael was the son of Helen and Leslie Lipton, \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Hamburg. From Haberdashers\u2019 school, then in Hampstead, he went on to Balliol College, Oxford, where he gained a first in philosophy, politics and economics (1960), and to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.He was an elected fellow of All Souls, Oxford (1961-68 and 1983-84), and held professorial posts at both the Institute of Development Studies in Brighton and at the University of Sussex. He was founding director of the university\u2019s Poverty Research Unit (1994-97), now the Centre for Poverty and Inequality Research. He also had attachments with the World Bank and the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington, where he was director of the consumption and nutrition division (1987-89).In 2003 Michael was appointed CMG; in 2006 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy; and in 2012 he won the Leontief prize, for contributions to economic theory that address contemporary realities and support just and sustainable societies.He was devoted to his family, and to classical music, running and chess. On the last of these, he published a number of books, including the co-authored The Two-Move Chess Problem (1966), and Collected Chess Problems of Michael Lipton (2016). From 2000 to 2002 he was president of the British Chess Problem Society.In his professional relationships Michael was rigorous and uncompromising, but he was also hospitable, generous and sympathetic.Merle died in 2022.

Some private landowners, such as national trusts and some farmers, open their land and pathways for people to walk in and that is not included in the 8% figure.In Scotland, there is a right to walk through the countryside, leaving no trace, with some exceptions such as not trampling over land that is growing crops. Under a Labour government, people in England would be granted the same rights.The right to roam campaign has been gaining momentum, with thousands of people having taken part in mass trespasses last summer to demand more access to the countryside.Sobel said: \u201cLabour\u2019s approach, like in Scotland, will be that Labour\u2019s right to roam will offer access to high-quality green and blue space in the rest of Britain. We will replace the default of exclusion with a default of access.\u201cResearch shows that people with a stronger connection to nature were more likely to behave positively towards the environment. It\u2019s quite simple: the more people engage with nature, the more likely they are to protect it.\u201dHe pointed out that access to nature was unfairly distributed in England, with people from minority ethnic groups and those in less affluent areas less likely to have accessible green space nearby.\u201cLabour will create a future where nature thrives, people have a deeper connection to the environment, and people have equal access to the benefits of green spaces,\u201d the MP for Leeds North West added.Jim McMahon, the shadow environment secretary, previously said that in government he would extend the right to roam but did not say a Scottish-style system would be in place.He said in January: \u201cThere are still huge parts of England and Wales that are off-limits when it comes to the right to access, whether that\u2019s woodlands, cliffs or rivers, where the rights that we are afforded in open countryside aren\u2019t then mirrored in those places.

On Thursday, the snowpack in the southern Sierra was 436% of normal for this time of year, according to California\u2019s department of water resources (DWR).\u201cThis year\u2019s massive snowpack is posing continued flood risks in the San Joaquin Valley,\u201d said the DWR director, Karla Nemeth, in a written statement, noting the bittersweet outcome of very wet winter after years of drought.The snowpack will lead to sustained high flows across the San Joaquin and Tulare basins over several months, Nemeth said.Widespread damage has already been done. The rapidly rising waters forced evacuations across the region in early spring, as communities rushed to higher ground. In Tulare county \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest milk-producing regions \u2013 thousands of cows were lost to the floods, while roughly 75,000 had to be trailered to safety. Growers were washed out of key crops and workers lost out on jobs across the waterlogged valley.Nasa satellite images show the progression of flooding in the Tulare Lake basin. Photograph: NasaDecades have passed since Tulare \u2013 once the largest body of fresh water in the west \u2013 served as a vibrant wetland sprawling across nearly 800 sq miles. Carved up with canals and cleared for the cropland and livestock pastures in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the basin now spans across multiple counties and is home to roughly 4 million Californians.About half a dozen towns remain at risk from flooding, including Corcoran, where city officials are rushing to raise a sinking levee before the waters rise further. Stretching across 14.5 miles, the levee protects against flood waters up to 188ft. In March, Tulare Lake levels crept close, rising to 178ft.\u201cThe Corcoran community only has a small window of time and dry conditions before the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range snowmelt runoff converges with existing floodwaters in the Tulare Lake, and against the Corcoran Levee,\u201d emergency officials warned in a press release in April, noting that requests for state and federal funding had been made.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The DWR has initiated emergency work to pump high river flows away from the floodplain and into these recharge basins. Over the next four months, the plan could capture more than 55,000 acre-feet of water, according to the agency. (One acre-foot represents the amount of water needed to cover a football field a foot deep.)But along with bolstering the levees and other protections, some have advocated for a more permanent return of the lake, stewarded as an environmental resource.Others are also pushing for more water to be diverted into the historic lakebed ahead of the snowmelt, arguing that flooding the basin will alleviate overflows upstream and protect those who call the area home.\u201cThis year will result in record high amounts of water entering the Central Valley between Fresno and Bakersfield,\u201d resident Martin Chavez wrote in both English and Spanish on an online petition signed by hundreds. \u201cCommunities on the front line will first face the danger of this statewide issue, as the water is directed downstream out of stressed reservoirs.\u201d",

        "text": "Ministers\u2019 efforts to tackle the energy bills crisis have left the UK at risk of missing a key target to source green power and are threatening the country\u2019s net zero goal, the government spending watchdog has said.The government said in 2021 it wanted all electricity to be generated from low-carbon sources by 2035, a pillar in the plan to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.However, the National Audit Office (NAO) warned on Wednesday that the energy crisis which began in late 2021 and was exacerbated by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has meant the government has made little progress in producing a \u201clong-term delivery plan\u201d to boost clean energy sources.The NAO warned that \u201cthe absence of a clear plan and the perception that there could be changes in government policies could deter external investors from providing funds for new infrastructure or lead them to increase the rates of return they require, ultimately increasing costs for energy consumers\u201d.Emissions related to UK power generation have fallen by 73% since 1990 with increases in wind and solar power and the phasing out of coal power stations reducing the impact on the environment.However, about 40% of the UK\u2019s electricity is still generated from gas and the owners of gas-fired power plants are still picking up huge subsidies to keep the lights on when wind and solar power drop out owing to weather conditions.Electricity demand is predicted to increase by as much as 60% by 2035 as vehicles and heating are switched from fossil fuels to electricity. The UK has set a target of 2035 for a ban on the installation of new gas boilers, although efforts to encourage households to seek low-carbon alternatives have so far stalled.The government stepped in late last year to subsidise energy bills amid fears that the rise in wholesale gas prices would leave many households and businesses unable to afford bills.Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: \u201cIt is understandable that [the government] has focused on dealing with the immediate energy crisis over the past 12 months. But one consequence of this is that it lacks a delivery plan for decarbonising power by 2035, which is the backbone of its broader net zero ambition.\u201dHe added that the longer it took for a plan to be drawn up, \u201cthe higher the risk that it does not achieve its ambitions, or it does so at a greater than necessary cost to taxpayers and consumers\u201d.Meg Hillier MP, chair of the public accounts committee, said: \u201cThe department for energy security and net zero [DESNZ] does not have a delivery plan for decarbonising electricity.While DESNZ has understandably been focusing on its immediate response to the energy crisis, I\u2019m disappointed by its slow progress and lack of focus on the long-term. Without a delivery plan, it is unclear whether DESNZ\u2019s targets are achievable.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that is why we need to plan the transition carefully and fairly, not abandon it and add yet more carbon pollution to the atmosphere.\u201dThe government\u2019s attempt to press ahead with the Rosebank field flies in the face of warnings from scientists. Government spokespeople have repeatedly defended the plan, saying it will \u201chelp us meet our energy needs, while also supporting UK jobs, generating tax revenues and attracting investment\u201d.In the king\u2019s speech the government highlighted the apparent importance of new fossil fuel extraction to energy security: \u201cLegislation will be introduced to strengthen the United Kingdom\u2019s energy security and reduce reliance on volatile international energy markets and hostile foreign regimes. This bill will support the future licensing of new oil and gas fields, helping the country to transition to net zero by 2050 without adding undue burdens on households.\u201dIn September the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said Rosebank would help prevent young people from growing up \u201cdependent on foreign dictators\u201d for energy security.But in its answer to Russell-Moyle\u2019s question it appears the government is accepting it will have no meaningful impact on the UK\u2019s energy security or soaring household bills. It says: \u201cDue to UK refinery specifications and global market conditions, around 80% of the oil produced in the UK is refined overseas into the products demanded by the UK market. It is not desirable to force private companies to \u2018allocate\u2019 oil and gas produced in the North Sea for domestic use.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Black, a marine biologist with Monterey Bay Whale Watch and the director of the California Killer Whale Project, said the gathering was unique because the animals played in the bay for more than eight hours. Eleven family groups came together, or about 30 whales. Sometimes three or four whales would breach the water at once. Others slapped their tails against the water\u2019s surface, wrestled with one another and swam in loops.\u201cJust like kids that are in a park, they get excited and play with the other kids and may be more active,\u201d Black said. \u201cThe little ones were wrestling and rolling like a bunch of puppies.\u201dLittle is a relative term. Orca calves can weigh up to 400lbs (180kg) at birth. Killer whales have a \u201cmatriarchal society\u201d, Black said, and travel in groups led by a mother or grandmother. They rely on each other to hunt, share responsibilities for rearing calves and divide the burden of teaching their children. They generally travel with one family group, which can include between three and seven orcas.Sometimes three or four whales would breach the water at once in a stunning display put on by the orcas in Monterey Bay, California. Photograph: Daniel Bianchetta/Monterey Bay Whale WatchThat\u2019s what made Sunday\u2019s sighting so unusual. Although researchers know that orcas can communicate with underwater vocalizations, the sounds likely only travel about 10 miles (15km), Black said. With their territory ranging from California to Canada, Black said she doesn\u2019t know how the creatures all decided to \u201chang out together\u201d in Monterey Bay.Packs of orcas usually travel to the bay in April and May to hunt gray whale calves. There, they \u201cbinge eat\u201d on the calves, who are much larger than their usual prey of seals and sea lions, Black said. Sunday\u2019s \u201cplayful celebration\u201d likely came about because the animals were well-fed.The well-fed orcas decided to \u2018hang out together\u2019 in Monterey Bay. Photograph: Johanna Domise/Monterey Bay Whale WatchThe nonprofit California Killer Whale Project has spent three decades cataloging the killer whales that visit Monterey Bay. Black said that she was able to recognize many of the whales in the bay on Sunday by the markings and notches in their tails.Among them was Emma, a whale who gained notoriety among researchers for her skill at hunting gray whale calves. Emma\u2019s family once killed a baby gray whale in 15 min, a process that usually takes two hours, Black said. Emma brought her daughter, Louise, on Sunday. Emma has previously been spotted traveling with her mother, Xena, who was not at Sunday\u2019s gathering.They once caught nine gray whale calves in a month. \u201cWe were amazed, like how much can they eat?\u201d Black said.",

        "text": "As Cop28 in Dubai enters its final hours, the emotional weight of the moment is hard to bear. I find myself thinking of a six-year-old boy called Desmond I met in Turkana county, Kenya, who died from severe acute malnutrition on the same day. His death was the result of a climate-induced drought that has left millions of people on the brink of starvation in the Horn of Africa.I want the negotiators deciding the outcome of Cop28 to know Desmond\u2019s story. Because in the end, the climate crisis is not about pledges, statistics, reports or activists. It\u2019s about human suffering and ruined lives. It\u2019s about death.Right now in Dubai, the world\u2019s countries are negotiating what to do about fossil fuels. Some governments, such as those from small-island nations, are leading the push. Some, including the likes of Saudi Arabia, are blocking any meaningful progress.Over the weekend, there was a glimmer of hope. It looked like an agreement on phasing out all fossil fuels might just be possible. However, the latest draft of the global stocktake, released on Monday, showed a text that has been gutted of all references to oil or gas. References to \u201cphasing out fossil fuels\u201d have also been obliterated. The weak fossil-fuel cuts it does refer to are now presented as optional for countries \u2013 using the word \u201ccould\u201d rather than \u201cmust\u201d. There is also no mention of the need for developed countries to help finance the energy transition in developing countries.Selfish, short-sighted actors are once again sabotaging our collective fate in the name of profit. We know this: last week, Opec sent a letter to its oil-producing member countries asking them to block any progress on fossil fuel phase-out.It hardly needs repeating at this point, but the science is very clear. The only credible way to keep 1.5\u00baC alive is through a fast and just phase-out of all fossil fuels.The wording of the current draft also opens up loopholes for more pollution, like the undefined word \u201cabatement\u201d. We know that such language will tacitly condone increases in fossil-fuel production for years to come, with the pretence of relying on fairytale technologies such as carbon capture and storage. The Oxford Smith School said last week that a route to net zero by 2050 that is heavily reliant on carbon capture and storage would cost world governments $30tn more than a route relying on renewables and energy efficiency. It is a distraction designed to keep the oil and gas industry in business and receiving state subsidies.As time runs out in Dubai, it feels as though the lifeboat of our shared humanity is sinking. And fossil fuels are also not the entire story here. The \u201chome\u201d the majority of us will return to when Cop28 is over is not the home we once felt safe in. Many of our homelands are already being decimated by extreme weather. Huge changes are already with us and even more are inevitable \u2013 even if countries had agreed to a fossil fuel phase-out. So we must adapt.Cop28 needs to be the Cop that finally delivers a global goal on adaptation \u2013 a map for the world\u2019s attempts at adaptation and clarity on how we will fund them. At an absolute minimum, developed countries need to double adaptation finance to $40bn per year by 2025. This is a commitment they made two years ago in Glasgow, and which they are still far from fulfilling. Even through a self-interested lens, this makes basic economic sense. We know that every dollar spent on adaptation saves $6 in loss and damage.Cop28 live: talks expected to extend beyond official summit end after \u2018insufficient\u2019 draft textRead moreIn the final hours of Cop28, progressive states and activists need to fight with all we have for a phase-out of all fossil fuels, without distractions. We also need to see a real and tangible outcome on adaptation. They are connected. And neither can be sacrificed for the other.This will be hard. I know that it is difficult for nearly 200 nations to put their respective self interests aside and work for the common good. And I know that it may feel dark right now. The only light we have is from the cameras of 4,000 representatives of the world\u2019s media.But to those at Cop28, I say this: people around the world are watching you \u2013 including people who have watched their children die as a direct result of your decades of inaction.There is nowhere to hide.\nVanessa Nakate is a climate activist, Unicef goodwill ambassador and author of A Bigger Picture: My fight to bring a new African voice to the climate crisis\n",

It only works one way.\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, the agreement is null and void.\u201dThe group attempted to meet with the WA premier, Mark McGowan, and Aboriginal affairs minister, Tony Buti, to discuss scrapping the agreement, but were told both were unavailable due to \u201cprior commitments\u201d.Instead they expected to meet with other MPs on Thursday and with representatives from Woodside in a separate meeting.A spokesperson for the WA government said in a statement the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation is \u201cconsulted extensively\u201d and the state government \u201cencourages project proponents to obtain informed consent from traditional owners\u201d.\u201cMurujuga is also host to several export industries critical to the Western Australian and national economies, and it is a priority that these co-exist harmoniously with the surrounding cultural heritage,\u201d they said.\u201cThere is nothing in the BMIEA agreement preventing MAC, contracting parties, or individual members of those groups from providing submissions under any legislation to protect the cultural and heritage values of Murujuga.\u201dThe open letter also called for Woodside shareholders to withhold further investment as the company does not have the \u201cfree, prior, and informed consent of Murujuga Traditional Owners\u201d to proceed with its plans for the Scarborough gas field.A Woodside spokesperson said the company \u201chas engaged and consulted extensively\u201d with traditional owners in accordance with its policies and through its own investigations the company has found its developments \u201cwill not impact any rock art\u201d.\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morningA spokesperson for Perdaman said the company has \u201cfollowed all legal and regulatory approval processes for the last four years\u201d.\u201cThe Burrup and Maitland Industrial Estates Agreements (BMIEA) is an agreement between the WA Government and three previously registered native title claim groups. Amendment of the BMIEA is a matter for the parties to that agreement,\u201d they said in a statement.The Burrup Peninsula in the Pilbara \u2013 known as Murujuga to traditional custodians \u2013 is an outdoor gallery home to over a million examples of Indigenous rock art produced over a period of 50,000 years.The area was nominated for a world heritage listing in 2018. If successful, this would mean the area is protected in the same way as the pyramids of Giza, Stonehenge and the Taj Mahal.It is also the site of significant industrial development, with fossil fuel companies such as Woodside operating plants for processing gas, and two companies operating fertiliser plants in the area.Traditional custodians have previously raised concerns that the cumulative pollution from these operations is slowly acidifying the rocks, which erodes the art.",

        "text": "To say that Rishi Sunak\u2019s government has chosen the \u201cpath of climate vandalism\u201d, as Labour\u2019s Ed Miliband did this week, is no exaggeration. The policies contained in the energy plan announced on Thursday are dangerous. They will significantly worsen the climate crisis that threatens to engulf us all, if the globally agreed target of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is missed. Mr Sunak\u2019s record on green policies in the Treasury was dismal. As prime minister, he is steering the UK even further away from the course towards speedy decarbonisation that we should be on. In the long term, climate will surely top the list of public policy failures during this long period of Tory government.Hundreds of leading scientists wrote to Mr Sunak\u2019s government this week, calling for an end to new oil and gas developments. The government is set to defy them with plans for a huge North Sea oilfield, which it attempts to justify on the grounds that it is investing \u00a320bn (over 20 years) in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, in order to limit the damage caused. The scientists are right. The politicians and their fossil fuel industry backers are wrong. It is devastating that the UK is now trashing its own reputation for pioneering climate laws, which made national emissions reductions compulsory. Ministers have chosen risky, dirty energy over clean.There are some measures in the package that can, and must, be built on in future. Public investment in CCS would be welcome if it were not being offered as an excuse to keep on pumping oil. Technologies that remove carbon from the atmosphere could help to avoid global heating\u2019s worst effects. Carbon border taxes are a sensible mechanism to deter high-carbon imports, and the consultation on introducing these is welcome. Stronger emphasis from the Treasury on the need for private-sector investment in the green economy is helpful, and must be translated into workable policy.But the negatives of this plan far outweigh the positives. To prioritise investment in CCS technology that doesn\u2019t yet exist over the scaling up of renewables can only be described as reckless. Other omissions include the refusal to ban flaring by oil and gas producers, or to lift fully the moratorium on onshore wind imposed under David Cameron. The decision not to bring forward a ban on new gas boilers is reprehensible \u2013 all the more so given that this was proposed by the Conservative former minister Chris Skidmore in a recent report on net zero policy. There is still no firm commitment to home insulation, or obligation for housebuilders to fit solar panels on roofs. Nor is there a plan to cut emissions from farming. Combined with the tilt of the whole plan towards continued dependence on fossil fuels, the misnamed \u201cenergy security\u201d package is, in truth, a disastrous abdication of duty.The UK is far from alone in its failure to deliver on climate policies. President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act includes \u00a3370bn in clean energy spending, but his administration approved a colossal oil drilling project earlier this month. The rich developed nations that bear most responsibility for the climate crisis have yet to take the decisive action to end fossil fuel dependence and make the transition to the renewable sources and more manageable demand that the world needs. Until they do, the threat level will keep on rising \u2013 along with the growing instability to which it is tied.",

An OECD report from 2022 said water availability in Gotland was expected to decrease by 13% between 2021 and 2050.Following widespread enthusiasm for brown lawns in Gotland, other competitions have popped up in seven municipalities in Sweden this year, as well as three in Canada, in an effort to encourage people to use less water.A detail of Stina \u00d6stman\u2019s winning lawn.

I don\u2019t feel ashamed \u2013 I\u2019m happy to show the world \u2013 or at least Gotland,\u201d said \u00d6stman. Included in her prize was a T-shirt announcing her victory and a diploma.The runner-up, Madeleine Fagerlund, said: \u201cI was a little bit sad not to win \u2013 it\u2019s a really ugly lawn, it\u2019s just sand practically. We had a really dry spring. I think I deserved to win \u2013 but actually Stina\u2019s lawn was quite ugly too.\u201dFagerlund\u2019s neighbours have been complaining about her garden since she moved in. \u201cThe dog loves to dig in the dust, so there are a lot of holes and bumps, so at least he\u2019s very happy,\u201d she said.A report from the OECD praised the ugly lawn contest as a way to adapt to a changing climate. The report said the \u201cinnovative competition\u201d had \u201chelped to reduce water consumption and inspired a debate about water use outside Sweden\u2019s borders\u201d. Earlier this year, research showed 25 countries were facing extreme water stress, affecting more than a quarter of the world\u2019s population.Residents of Gotland are now challenging the world to share images of their ugly lawns. Johan Gustafsson, who works for Differ Agency, which does communications for the Gotland region, organises the competitions. He said: \u201cLots of people would like to see similar competitions in their local communities, and that is where the idea was born to make it a global competition.\u201dHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural norm in Sweden to have a well-kept lawn, like it is to have your house in order. An ugly lawn is considered a sign that something is wrong, that you are not on top of things.\u201dThe lawn of another entrant, Marie Andersson. Photograph: 2023 Gotland\u2019s ugliest lawn competitionHe said he believed Australia, the US and South Africa could have some strong contributions. In arid areas of the US, water used on lawns and gardens accounts for 60% of household water usage, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.Gustafsson said: \u201cWe wanted to make sustainability communication positive \u2013 it\u2019s common to see negative headlines that make you feel bad. This is the opposite \u2013 the competition made people smile and they didn\u2019t have to do a thing to participate, they could just relax and have a cup of tea. We think that also made it a success.\u201dPeople can enter by sharing a picture on Instagram with the hashtag #worldsugliestlawn or emailing uglylawn@gotland.se. The jury will select the winner in December 2023. Already someone from Berlin has submitted an entry to the global competition. \u201cBerlin is always good at ugliness contests,\u201d they wrote.",

Campaigners raised concerns at the time that it might not have the same teeth as the EU and that it would not be able to stop the government riding roughshod over environment protections.Last week the OEP wrote to the environment secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, arguing that core parts of the national emissions ceiling regulations (NECR) should not be deleted under the Retained EU Law Act (REUL). However, Coffey has made it clear that the department will ignore the advice of the OEP.The act, which became law in June, will scrap hundreds of EU laws by the end of this year, including environmental protections, and the government voted down an amendment in the Lords that would have prioritised the environment.Dame Glenys Stacey, the chair of the watchdog, wrote: \u201cIn our view, the revocation of these regulations weakens accountability and transparency and in the absence of an alternative, comprehensive plan it has the potential to weaken environmental protection.\u201dThe parts of the regulations to be deleted require the government to prepare and implement its plan to reduce pollutants like nitrogen oxides and ammonia, and to review it if emissions are projected to exceed targets. The regulations also demand public consultation before revising the programme.She added these duties appeared even more important considering that the government \u201cdid not meet the emission reductions required for PM2.5 in 2021 [fine particulate matter]\u201d \u2013 indicating insufficient progress is being made towards the UK\u2019s legally binding emission reduction commitments.In her response Coffey indicated that the plans would proceed, and disagreed that there would be a \u201creduction in the level of environmental protection\u201d. She claimed the \u201cintent in removing regulations 9 and 10 of the NECR is to reduce administrative burdens and aid transparency regarding air quality emissions policy\u201d.Lawyers and environment experts have criticised her response, saying it amounts to weakening existing legal air pollution protections.Ruth Chambers of the Greener UK coalition said: \u201cThe government has repeatedly claimed it will not weaken environmental protections, but deleting these safeguards without alternative plans in place is a clear example of deregulation. Next year ministers could be under fewer obligations to improve air quality.\u201cUntil there are plans across the UK to enforce commitments to reducing air pollution, these regulations should be retained.\u201dEmily Kearsey, a lawyer at the charity ClientEarth, said: \u201cWhile air quality in the UK is already at public health crisis levels, this government is now trying to weaken existing legal protections for the air we breathe. This is wholly unacceptable \u2013 particularly from a government that has committed to making the UK an environmental leader.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The groups say it violates the state constitution\u2019s one-subject rule, which requires laws to contain one subject that is clearly expressed in the title, and the three-consideration rule, which requires the legislature to consider every bill on three separate days.\u201cThis law is nothing more than an illegitimate giveaway to the oil and gas industry,\u201d said Megan Hunter, an attorney for Earthjustice, the legal non-profit representing some of the appellants. \u201cWe will defend Ohio\u2019s public lands from this unconstitutional attack.\u201dState lawmakers passed the expansive bill with little discussion or fanfare after a final reading in the Ohio senate chambers during a lame-duck session at the end of 2022.Ignoring pressure to veto the bill, Governor Mike DeWine signed it into the statute book on 6 January after reassuring protesters he would prohibit any new drilling in Ohio state parks \u2013 even though the law removes the state\u2019s discretion to deny those leases.Oil and gas leasing was already allowed at state parks, but the new law mandates state agencies to lease to any interested party with insurance and financial assurances that has registered with the Ohio natural resources department \u2013 without going to auction or giving public notice or opportunity for public comment.In addition, the new law defines methane gas as \u201cgreen energy\u201d \u2013 a term typically reserved for solar, wind and other renewable energy sources. Methane is a fossil fuel greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere at 80 times the rate of carbon dioxide, which is responsible for about 25% of the heat trapped by all greenhouse gases.An outside dark-money group with ties to the gas industry helped push a false narrative that the law will help the transition to clean energy, according to the Washington Post.",

It\u2019s a years-long process to combat it, and develop better tools. But the really great thing about this is you have very invested and interested consumers pushing on this problem.\u201cIt brings a lot more attention, resources, capacity, in all walks along the way.\u201dThe process starts with hunters in the Everglades tracking, trapping and humanely killing pythons, which can grow up to 20ft in length. Inversa processes and tans the skins, which Piper & Skye, a New York accessory brand known for environmental ethics as well as its upmarket leather products, makes into a range of colorful handbags. Those at the top of the range go for almost $1,000.The project utilizes a bounty system similar to the one Inversa operates to incentivize low-income fishers in the Caribbean to whom coral-destroying lionfish are otherwise worthless.\u201cHow a product is made, what it\u2019s made of, and the people who make it are just as important as the product itself,\u201d said Joanna MacDonald, creative director of Piper & Skye.Chavda said he expected the number of pythons caught and processed this way to grow as consumers become aware of the story behind the handbags.Wildlife authorities in Florida, in conjunction with university researchers and environmental groups, have employed a variety of tactics in recent years to try to get a handle on the python problem, which the USGS has described as \u201cone of the most intractable\u201d invasive species challenges in the world.The Florida fish and wildlife commission (FWC) runs an annual 10-day python challenge with a $10,000 prize for the most prolific hunter.

It\u2019s not a particularly safe route, with many sections where Hipkins would be riding right alongside 100kmh traffic. It\u2019s this kind of danger that stops cycle commuting from being particularly mainstream \u2013 just 2% commuted by bike at the last census \u2013 but this is far from a political priority for Hipkins. He loves to cycle, but the main thing he wants to do is win.This intense drive towards victory is crucial to understanding why Hipkins has spent the last month ditching many sections of his government\u2019s climate change policy, all in the aftermath of two major storms which were likely worse because of climate change. It explains why a government that happily tells other nations to stop subsidising fossil fuels is once again extending a tax cut on petrol and diesel. It\u2019s why Hipkins on Monday ditched not just expensive climate policies like the \u201ccash for clunkers\u201d scrappage scheme, but also the drive to lower speed limits in many parts of the country to increase road safety.We can\u2019t afford to choose adaptation over cutting emissions \u2013 suggesting otherwise is dangerous | James ShawRead moreIt\u2019s not that the government couldn\u2019t lower speeds and fix storm-damaged roads at the same time \u2013 our transport agency has around 2,400 staff \u2013 it\u2019s that Hipkins doesn\u2019t want to talk about lowering the speed limit. He doesn\u2019t want to talk about spending a small amount of money on bike lanes or a media merger or votes for 16-year-olds, and he doesn\u2019t want the media talking about it either. The money is immaterial; the conversation is not. This message discipline is ruthless enough that Hipkins is willing to ditch policies his colleagues have spent months or years on, all for emptier column inches. He\u2019s betting that the flurry of headlines about the government getting rid of any policies that don\u2019t have to do with what he calls \u201cbread and butter issues\u201d will win him votes.And it seems to be working. Hipkins has climbed in the preferred prime ministerial stakes in recent polls, and Labour is now solidly back in contention for this year\u2019s election. Hipkins would argue that the climate is far better served by Labour winning the election than a National-Act coalition. After all, the Act party has flirted with outright denialism within living memory, while National gutted the Emissions Trading Scheme while last in government, and remains committed to reopening offshore drilling for oil and gas.But Labour cannot simply delete policies until it is in government for ever. Presumably at the election this year it will have to have some actual policies to address the fact that New Zealand\u2019s reliance on cars and cows mean we have quite high per-capita emissions and no easy path to bringing those down, given the easier job of decarbonising our electricity generation is largely already finished. If Labour doesn\u2019t have those policies to talk about then the Green party, which it will need to form a government, will happily fill the void. Green party co-leader James Shaw, who is also the climate change minister, told this columnist Hipkins\u2019 repeated backdowns on climate policy were \u201cdisappointing and making things harder\u201d.\u201cIndividually none of these policies actually add up to much \u2013 but the cumulative effect is starting to add up. We\u2019re running out of easy options. It\u2019s getting very difficult to find options that we haven\u2019t already exhausted,\u201d Shaw said.Jacinda Ardern\u2019s successor makes a big strategic retreatRead moreShaw rebuffs those who want the government to simply ditch various climate policies and focus exclusively on pricing carbon through the Emissions Trading Scheme, saying the necessary price would be politically impossible. He notes that the recent surge in electric vehicle sales brought on by the government\u2019s feebate scheme would have required an emissions price of about $500 a tonne \u2013 a price that \u201cwould result in the closure of all our heavy industry and eye-watering fuel prices for those who aren\u2019t able to get an electric car.\u201dHipkins\u2019 desertion of the field will probably benefit Shaw in the short term. The Greens can soak up climate conscious votes while Hipkins takes more of the centre-ground. But really big bold policy changes in New Zealand generally require one of the main two parties. That\u2019s why Ardern\u2019s \u201cnuclear-free\u201d line had such staying power \u2013 because it recalled a time when Labour was willing to take a big bold stance and fight with the rest of the world over it. Now the party just wants to backpedal.\nHenry Cooke is a freelance journalist covering New Zealand politics\n",

        "text": "Offices, schools, supermarkets and hospitals should be monitored for indoor air pollutants, according to England\u2019s chief medical officer, amid concerns that dirty air in buildings may contribute to nearly as many deaths as outdoor air pollution.Prof Chris Whitty said monitoring indoor air quality should become standard practice in public spaces and called for urgent investment to help establish records of pollutants that accumulate in homes, offices and public buildings.Wood burners in effect banned in new and refurbished homes in LondonRead moreWhile efforts to improve outdoor air quality have driven down emissions of particulates, nitrogen dioxides and sulphur dioxide, indoor air quality has largely been neglected. In buildings, air can be contaminated with fine particles from wood burners and cooking, and with noxious gases, cancer-causing chemicals, and pathogens such as viruses, bacteria and molds, all of which contribute to health problems.Writing in the journal Nature, Whitty, Alastair Lewis, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of York, and Dr Deborah Jenkins, a specialist registrar in public health at the Department of Health, call for a scientific push to understand indoor air pollution, with the aim of producing a \u201croadmap to cleaner indoor air.\u201d\u201cIndoor air pollution hasn\u2019t received the same attention [as outdoor air], even though it might cause almost as many deaths globally,\u201d the authors write. The lack of research makes it hard for governments to target policies and controls, while building owners may be oblivious to the health risks and how to reduce them, they add.Most people in industrialised countries spend 80-90% of their time indoors, in homes and offices or public spaces such as schools, shops, hospitals and transport hubs. But while indoor air contains a wider range of pollutants than outdoor air, reliable information on sources, concentrations, the harm they cause and ways to make buildings healthier beyond better ventilation is lacking.The risks are shifting all the time. In England, coal burning, cigarette smoking, chemicals from paints, and nitrogen oxides from gas have all fallen in recent years. But volatile organic compounds from cosmetics and personal care products have risen, as have particulates due to the popularity of wood burners. Other concerns surround formaldehyde from building materials, brominated fire retardants in furniture, and radon from the bedrock beneath buildings.One of the major challenges for scientists is that indoor air quality varies enormously with how buildings are built, ventilated, operated and occupied. According to Whitty, levels of volatile organic compounds can differ by a factor of 1,000 in identical houses on the same street, simply because people inside behave differently.\u201cMonitoring the indoor environment for pollution should become standard practice in public spaces,\u201d the researchers write, adding that \u201cindoor emission inventories need urgent investment\u201d.There are immediate actions people could take, at least in their homes, Lewis said. \u201cYou can do quite a lot, particularly with ensuring reasonable levels of ventilation. Unless you live in a highly polluted city, the outdoor air is going to be cleaner than that inside,\u201d he said.Prof Catherine Noakes, an expert in the spread of airborne diseases in buildings at Leeds University, said poor air quality affected productivity, school test scores and sleep quality, as well as asthma and infectious diseases. \u201cAction to monitor the air in buildings is an important step that we need to take,\u201d she said.A recent report by the Royal Academy of Engineering found that improving ventilation in public and commercial buildings was cost-effective through reducing infections alone.Dr Gary Fuller, an air pollution scientist at Imperial College London, said more must be done to tackle pollution at source. \u201cWe cannot control indoor air pollution by ventilation systems alone,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people cannot afford to upgrade their homes, and those in flats or rented homes have no options to change. Instead, manufacturers of products that we use in our homes need to accept responsibility for the air pollution that they create and work to reduce this.\u201d",

        "text": "New York state has passed legislation that will scale up the state\u2019s renewable energy production and signals a major step toward moving utilities out of private hands to become publicly owned.The bill, included in the state\u2019s new budget, will require the state\u2019s public power provider to generate all of its electricity from clean energy by 2030. It also allows the public utility to build and own renewables while phasing out fossil fuels.\u201cIt\u2019s a historic win for the climate and for clean jobs,\u201d said Lee Ziesche, organizer with Public Power New York, a coalition that has been fighting to pass the legislation for the past four years. \u201cIt\u2019ll create a model of public power for the whole country, and it\u2019s really showing that our energy should be a public good.\u201dThe Build Public Renewables Act (BPRA) will ensure that all state-owned properties that ordinarily receive power from the New York power authority (NYPA) are run on renewable energy by 2030. It will also require municipally owned properties \u2013 including many hospitals and schools, as well as public housing and public transit \u2013 to switch to renewable energy by 2035.NYPA provides low-cost electricity to more than 1,000 customers, ranging from local and state government buildings to electric cooperatives, businesses and non-profits. It also sells a portion of its power on the wholesale market, where utilities can purchase it. The legislation will require NYPA to offer low-to-moderate income customers a lower utility rate for renewable energy.The passage of this first-of-its-kind law comes after years of grassroots campaigning by climate and environmental organizers in New York state.NYPA is the largest state public utility in the country. The vast majority of the electricity generated by NYPA comes from hydropower: over 80%. This new legislation will require the state to phase out the six natural gas-fired plants that NYPA operates across New York City by 2030. (NYPA had previously agreed to shut down the plants by 2035.) NYPA built these \u201cpeaker plants\u201d in 2001 to meet energy demands during peak times \u2013 such as the hottest days of the year. The plants, which emit nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide, are located in the Queens and the Bronx boroughs of New York City and the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan \u2013 the latter two of which have some of the highest asthma-related death rates in the country.\u2018They\u2019ll be erased\u2019: New Mexico races to save its ancient irrigation canalsRead moreFounded in 1931 by then Governor Franklin D Roosevelt, NYPA was designed to provide low-cost electricity across New York state. More than 2,000 public power utilities operate in nearly every state in the United States, serving one in seven customers and accounting for 10% of all electricity. Nebraska is the only state entirely supplied by publicly owned utilities.The communities closest to the NYPA peaker plants \u201chave been expendable\u201d, said Ziesche. She pointed out that some power plants are also built near freeways, compounding the levels of pollution nearby residents face.Historically, when utilities are owned by investors, profits go to shareholders. But in publicly owned models, profits are reinvested in the utility\u2019s operations. Rates on energy bills are also generally lower.In February of this year, the cost of natural gas nationwide was 24% higher than the year prior. While many ratepayers were unprepared for the sudden bill increases, shareholders of privately owned utility companies saw astronomical profits \u2013 including those of ConEdison, which provides power to the New York metropolitan area and made over $1.3bn in profits.When gas prices increased, \u201cIt was ratepayers who were caught in the lurch\u201d, said Aaron Eisenberg, part of the Public Power New York Coalition. \u201cPutting renewables on the grid in New York state makes us less dependent on gas and ensures we have a reliable source of energy provided by a trusted source that\u2019s been around for 90 years.\u201dZiesche added: \u201cIt\u2019s important to make sure that low income communities are not paying an arm and a leg for new energy generation \u2026 People having access to affordable electricity is going to be a huge part of surviving the climate crisis. People die when it gets too hot, and if they\u2019re afraid to turn on their air conditioners that\u2019s a serious problem.\u201dThe newly passed law also ensures creation of union jobs for the renewable projects, guaranteeing pay rate protection, offering retraining, and making sure that new positions are filled with workers who have lost or would be losing employment in the non-renewable energy sector.NYPA is made up of a board of trustees appointed by the governor. A portion of the bill intended to expand the board to include members from labor and environmental justice groups did not make the final provision.",

The figures show how privatisation \u2013 which was intended to lead to a new era of investment, improved water quality and low bills \u2013 turned water into a cash cow for investment firms and private equity companies, none more so than the Australian infrastructure asset management firm Macquarie which, with its co-investors, bought Thames Water in 2006 from the German utility firm RWE for \u00a34.8bn.Bar chartBy the time Macquarie sold its stake in Thames Water in 2017, debts had more than tripled from \u00a33.2bn to \u00a310.5bn, unadjusted for inflation. Its pattern was to borrow against its assets to increase dividend payments to shareholders.By 2017, when Macquarie sold its last stake, the pattern of debt remained, and the rate of accruing debt continued on the same trajectory.Bar chartMacquarie and its co-investors made their position clear from the start, hiking dividends in the first year of their operations, 2007, to \u00a3656m when profits were a fraction of that at \u00a3241m.Over their 11 years of control, Macquarie and its co-investors paid out \u00a32.8bn to shareholders, which is two-fifths of the total \u00a37bn in dividends that Thames Water has paid between 1990 and 2022. The average yearly dividends paid during the Macquarie period were five times higher than those paid after it sold its final stake in 2017. The consortium that took over ownership of Thames Water in 2017 has not taken a dividend since, but the company has paid internal dividends \u2013 including \u00a337m in the year to 31 March 2022.ChartOfwat recommends that companies maintain a ratio of debt to capital value of 60%. But Thames Water\u2019s debt now amounts to \u00a314.3bn \u2013 almost a quarter of the total \u00a360bn debt run up by the privatised water companies in just over three decades.This weight of debt is at one of the highest levels in the industry, with Thames Water\u2019s gearing at 80%. More than half of this debt is inflation-linked, leaving Thames facing hikes on its debt repayment, even as it is being told to invest billions more fixing the infrastructure which has been left to crumble. This article was amended on 1 July 2023 to temporarily remove the graphic on \u201cgearing\u201d pending a review of the figure shown for Severn Trent. A previous version mistakenly said Severn Trent\u2019s gearing was 83.7% at March 2022, when the correct figure was 59.2%. However, the revised graphic, published on 3 July, now uses the latest figures for each company - based on their own financial reports - rather than March 2022 data. Figures for several of the water companies have been amended as a result, and the graphic\u2019s source information has been updated accordingly.",

Among the decisions they must make at the UN conference will be whether to agree, for the first time, to gradually \u201cphase out\u201d fossil fuels.Research has shown that switching from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy sources would save many lives from air pollution and help combat global heating. However, until now, mortality estimates have varied widely.A new modelling study suggests air pollution, from the use of fossil fuels in industry, power generation, and transportation, accounts for 5.1 million avoidable deaths a year globally. These findings were published in The BMJ.The contribution of fossil fuels equates to 61% of a total estimated 8.3 million deaths worldwide due to outdoor air pollution from all sources in 2019.The new estimates of fossil fuel-related deaths are larger than most previously reported values, suggesting that phasing out fossil fuels might have a greater impact on attributable mortality than previously thought.deaths from air pollution\u201cOur results suggest that a global phase-out of fossil fuels will have large health benefits, much larger than indicated by most previous studies,\u201d the global team of researchers wrote in the BMJ. \u201cThese data support increasing the share of clean, renewable energy, advocated by the UN through the sustainable development goals for 2030 and the ambition of climate neutrality for 2050.\u201dAmbient air pollution is the leading environmental health risk factor for illness and death, but few global studies have attributed deaths to specific air pollution sources and their results widely differ.To address this, an international team of researchers from the UK, US, Germany, Spain and Cyprus, used a new model to estimate deaths due to air pollution related to fossil fuels, and to assess potential health benefits from policies that replace fossil fuels with clean, renewable energy sources.They assessed excess deaths using data from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 study, as well as Nasa satellite-based fine particulate matter and population data, and atmospheric chemistry, aerosol, and relative risk modelling for 2019.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This has been compounded by higher financing costs due to the recent hike in interest rates.The global cost pressures have wiped billions from the market value of major offshore wind developers and cast doubt on the future of big projects. This has raised concern over government clean energy targets and whether climate goals can be achieved.Sweden\u2019s Vattenfall has scrapped plans for a huge offshore windfarm off the UK\u2019s Norfolk coast because rising costs meant it was no longer profitable.

        "text": "A public spending watchdog has criticised the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs amid concerns about a lack of long-term planning to tackle waste and boost recycling.A 56-page report, published by the National Audit Office (NAO), found that household recycling rates in England had stalled over the last decade.A government target to recycle 50% of household waste by 2020 was missed, an objective derived from a 2008 EU directive. Instead, rates settled around 43-44% between 2011 and 2018-19.The NAO also found that four years on from an ambitious 2018 strategy on waste, ministers and officials had failed to develop \u201ceffective long-term delivery plans that set out how it will achieve its ambitions\u201d.Such a lack of clarity made it more difficult for businesses to prepare for investment and regulatory changes necessary to meet the government\u2019s long-term plans, the NAO said.While progress was noted in some areas, the watchdog repeatedly expressed concerns about the adequacy of long-term planning and highlighted delays to collection and packaging reforms.It found Defra had not yet set out how England\u2019s waste system as a whole would need to change to meet the government\u2019s objectives, although officials were working on a \u201croadmap\u201d for waste infrastructure up to 2035.Elsewhere, concerns were raised that Defra, led by Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, did not possess \u201ca full understanding of the nature and extent of the changes that will be required to realise the benefits it expects from the reforms\u201d.\u201cWithout this, there are risks that it loses focus on benefits in the run-up to launching the schemes, and that the reforms fail to achieve the levels of recycling, waste reduction and greenhouse gas emissions savings that are needed,\u201d the report, published on Friday, warned.It also suggested that uncertainties remained about the scale of the benefits of the government\u2019s planned deposit return scheme for drinks bottles and cans, with auditors noting that the department \u201chas no current plans to test the scheme through piloting\u201d.The head of the NAO, Gareth Davies, said: \u201cReducing waste is critical to reducing emissions and achieving some of government\u2019s wider environmental goals, but Defra does not have effective long-term plans for how it will achieve its ambitions for reducing waste, and there has been delay to its implementation of reforms.\u201cDefra must now establish a clear and coherent plan for its work on waste and resources, addressing the weaknesses in the reforms already in progress. If Defra takes these steps, it will be in a much stronger position to achieve its ambitions.\u201dThe NAO also called for a review of the deposit return scheme to determine the likely take-up and whether a pilot scheme would help protect value for money.Labour\u2019s Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said Defra had a \u201cculture of delay\u201d.\u201cNearly five years on from its 2018 strategy, Defra has much to do before it can implement major reforms like the deposit return scheme,\u201d she said. \u201cDefra must give households, local authorities and businesses the confidence they need to substantially change behaviours, or risk further setbacks to our environmental objectives.\u201dThe Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of groups campaigning for environmental protection, warned the government was a \u201clong way off hitting its target of 65% recycling by 2035\u201d and called for an ambitious deposit return scheme.Its chief executive, Richard Benwell, said: \u201cBoosting and simplifying local recycling is an important part of dealing with waste, but we really need to see measures to stop so many raw materials being used in the first place \u2013 often being transported all over the world just to be used for a few moments.\u201d",

        "text": "On 27 December, former kickboxer, professional misogynist and online entrepreneur Andrew Tate, 36, sent a boastfully hostile tweet to climate activist Greta Thunberg, 19, about his sports car collection. \u201cPlease provide your email address so I can send a complete list of my car collection and their respective enormous emissions,\u201d he wrote. He was probably hoping to enhance his status by mocking her climate commitment. Instead, she burned the macho guy to a crisp in nine words.He went looking for attention; he got itCars are routinely tokens of virility and status for men, and the image accompanying his tweet of him pumping gas into one of his vehicles, coupled with his claims about their \u201cenormous emissions\u201d, had unsolicited dick pic energy. Thunberg seemed aware of that when she replied: \u201cyes, please do enlighten me. email me at smalldickenergy@getalife.com.\u201dHer reply gained traction to quickly become one of the top 10 tweets of all time; as I write, it\u2019s been liked 3.5 million times and shared directly 650,000 or so, and the interchange became the topic of countless news stories around the world, from India to Australia.There\u2019s a direct association between machismo and the refusal to recognize and respond appropriately to the climate catastrophe. It\u2019s a result of versions of masculinity in which selfishness and indifference \u2013 individualism taken to its extremes \u2013 are defining characteristics, and therefore caring and acting for the collective good is their antithesis.\u201cMen resist green behavior as unmanly\u201d is the headline for a 2017 story on the phenomenon. Machismo and climate denial, as well as alliance with the fossil fuel industry, is a package deal for the right, from the \u201crolling coal\u201d trucks whose plumes of dark smoke are meant as a sneer at climate causes to Republicans in the US who have long opposed nearly all climate action (and are major recipients of oil money).Thunberg\u2019s takedown clearly stung Tate, who 10 hours later tweeted out a pompous video in which he tried to reassert his masculinity and status by blathering on in a dressing gown, with a cigar and a pizza box as props. Not long after that, he and his brother Tristan Tate were arrested by Romanian authorities in connection with appalling allegations of sex trafficking. Tate is a troll and a creep; he\u2019s also alleged to be a pimp and rapist. Tate denies all wrongdoing.Tate is part of a huge network of far-right men online and he\u2019d been banned from most social media platforms. Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter let him back on not long before the tweet that was heard around the world.He was hoping to promote himself with his sneer at Thunberg; he managed to raise his visibility just in time to make news of his arrest and the charges international news. By at least one account, the Romanian-brand pizza box in his video helped cue police to his location, although the authorities have thrown doubt on that. \u201cFunny, but no,\u201d a spokesperson told the Associated Press. Still, had he not harassed Thunberg, the news of his arrest and the charges would not have been major news. He went looking for attention; he got it.Thunberg drily tweeted the morning of the 30th: \u201cthis is what happens when you don\u2019t recycle your pizza boxes,\u201d mocking her own earnest public image. So far it has 2.6 million likes. Beyond the entertainment value of what transpired over the past few days is a serious reminder of the intersection between machismo, misogyny, hostility to climate action and climate science, and the dank underworld of rightwing characters like Tate recruiting white boys and young men to their views.\nRebecca Solnit is a Guardian US columnist.

        "text": "In May and June 2020, the death of 350 elephants in Botswana\u2019s Okavango delta baffled conservationists and sparked global speculation about what had caused it. Elephants of all ages and both sexes were affected, with many walking in circles before dying suddenly, collapsing on their faces. Two months later, 35 more elephants died in north-western Zimbabwe.At the time, the deaths in Botswana were attributed to an unspecified cyanobacterial toxin, government officials said, and no further details were published.But tests on the elephants that died in Zimbabwe have finally come back and shown the cause was a little-known bacterium called Pasteurella Bisgaard taxon 45, which resulted in septicaemia, or blood poisoning.The bacterial infection has not previously been linked to elephant deaths, according to the paper published in the Nature Communications journal. Researchers believe it could have been the same one responsible for the deaths in neighbouring countries.\u201cThis represents an important conservation concern for elephants in the largest remaining meta-population of this endangered species,\u201d researchers wrote in the paper. It was written by an international team of researchers from the Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust, the University of Surrey, laboratories in South Africa and the UK government\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).African savanna elephants are declining by 8% a year, primarily due to poaching, with 350,000 remaining in the wild. The paper suggests that infectious diseases should be added to the list of pressures they are facing.Dr Arnoud van Vliet from the University of Surrey said the infection \u201cadds to the growing list of disease-related threats to elephant conservation\u201d. Elephants are highly sociable animals, and also were likely stressed due to the drought conditions at the time, which made such an outbreak more likely.Pasteurella bacteria has previously been linked to the sudden death of about 200,000 saiga antelopes in Kazakhstan \u2013 an incident that researchers believe could shed light on what happened to the elephant herds. Scientists believe the Pasteurella bacteria generally lives harmlessly in the tonsils of some, if not all, of the antelopes. An unusual temperature increase to 37C, however, caused the bacteria to pass into the bloodstream, where it caused septicaemia.Bisgaard taxon 45 has previously been found to exist in tigers and lions (found by testing a bite wound in a human) as well as chipmunks and psittacines, according to the paper.Hundreds of elephants dead in mysterious mass die-offRead moreOther things experts tested for included cyanide, which some people use to poison elephants, but there were no traces of any poisons in the carcasses or near the waterholes. Other theories included ingestion of toxins from algal blooms. Poaching was immediately ruled out because the carcasses still had tusks attached.The lead investigator, Dr Chris Foggin, a wildlife veterinarian at the Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust, said investigating the mass deaths had been \u201cchallenging\u201d.\u201cIdentifying and then reaching the carcasses in time to obtain useful samples is one problem we often face. However, we also didn\u2019t know what disease we may be dealing with,\u201d he said.\u201cWe initially suspected that it could be anthrax, which is known to occur in the area; or possibly some other disease that might pose a risk to human health. We therefore had to be cautious when undertaking the postmortem examinations on elephants which, in itself, is a difficult task with such a big animal, especially working in field conditions.\u201dScientists were unable to visit the site in neighbouring Botswana and most official samples were collected from animals that had already started rotting. The paper says the findings of blood poisoning \u201cmay represent an ongoing phenomenon in this region\u201d, with previous cases missed due to lack of testing.",

        "text": "The Scottish government is delaying its deposit return scheme for more than two years after accusing UK government ministers of deliberately sabotaging its plans.Lorna Slater, the Scottish Greens minister, said on Wednesday afternoon the recent decision by ministers in London to bar the Scottish government from including glass in its scheme meant it was no longer feasible in its current form.She said the ban on including glass was intended to undermine Scotland\u2019s scheme, even though it had been endorsed in 2020 by every party at Holyrood including the Conservatives, and to weaken the powers of Scotland\u2019s devolved parliament.Ministers in London had also imposed an as-yet-undefined cap on deposit charges, currently set at 20p in Scotland, a single administration fee for all firms across the UK, and one UK-wide barcode on affected products, she said.\u201cThese delays and dilutions lie squarely in the hands of a UK government that has sadly seemed so far more intent on sabotaging this parliament than protecting our environment,\u201d Slater told MSPs.She said the Scottish government therefore had decided to suspend its scheme until England, Wales and Northern Ireland introduced theirs from October 2025. A Scottish government source said they hoped an incoming Labour government might decide to reinstate glass after the next general election.Scottish ministers had wanted their scheme to begin in March 2024. But under the UK\u2019s post-Brexit internal market rules, designed to minimise trade barriers within the UK, they needed permission from Westminster to introduce a mandatory deposit and different barcodes.Campaigners who support deposit return schemes, widely used in other European countries, said excluding glass on cost grounds will substantially reduce the amount of glass being recycled and increase carbon emissions.They said the delay would mean millions of plastic and glass bottles and aluminium cans would now litter Scottish streets, fields and beaches.Dr Kat Jones, the director of Action to Protect Rural Scotland, which has campaigned for the scheme, said: \u201cThis is a bleak day for anyone who cares about Scotland\u2019s litter crisis, or indeed the global climate crisis. [It] is a victory for those in industry who have never wanted to pick up the costs of their irresponsible business model.\u201dSlater\u2019s announcement, which had been signalled earlier this week by Humza Yousaf, the first minister, follows an increasing bitter dispute within Scotland about the effectiveness and costs of the scheme, which has already been delayed three times and repeatedly revised.It was heavily attacked by two candidates to succeed Nicola Sturgeon as Scottish National party leader earlier this year, including Kate Forbes, who narrowly lost the contest to Yousaf. Craft brewers, small shop owners, small soft drinks makers and whisky producers had also strongly criticised it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "Aerial surveys of the North Sea have revealed that seals practise social distancing \u2013 and the discovery may have profound implications for the spread of disease among the marine mammals.In a paper published today by the Royal Society, researchers conducting censuses of grey and harbour seals detail new evidence that the two species not only maintain distances between their own kind (unlike walruses, for instance, who cluster close together) but also that this behaviour may \u201creflect an evolutionary response to viral susceptibility\u201d.\u201cBy comparing harbour seal colonies with grey seal colonies, we have found that harbour seals keep a greater distance from their neighbours than grey seals do,\u201d the report\u2019s lead author, Jeroen Hoekendijk, of the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research and Wageningen Marine Research, told the Guardian. With catastrophic rates of bird flu currently contributing to serious concerns about disease in wildlife, the new report may have important implications for the way such outbreaks are tracked.The area surveyed was a wild expanse on the coast of the Dutch Wadden Sea, where both species of seals \u201chaul out\u201d on the intertidal flats and beaches to rest, socialise, mate and give birth. They gather there in great numbers. Up to 6,500 grey seals choose the high sandbanks, while harbour seals \u2013 about 8,000 were observed \u2013 prefer sands revealed at low tide.Unfortunately, the large numbers of harbour seals have faced disastrous outbreaks of disease in the past. Phocine (seal) distemper virus ravaged the populations in 1988 and 2002, halving numbers. About 18,000 harbour seals died of distemper in the UK and Europe in the 1988 outbreak. Grey seals, however, remained relatively unharmed.A grey seal colony on the sand of the Wadden Sea on the north-western coast of the Netherlands. Photograph: Jeroen Hoekendijk/Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research/Wageningen Marine Research\u201cMany grey seals were actually also infected, but just didn\u2019t get as sick as harbour seals,\u201d said Hoekendijk. \u201cThis may actually have contributed to the spread of the virus. They carry the virus, but can still move around freely.\u201d He pointed to recent evidence that the grey\u2019s reduced susceptibility had \u201cgenetic underpinnings\u201d.Fascinatingly, it may be that the social distancing described in the new report represents a memory of those severe outbreaks. \u201cOther studies have shown that grey seals are more resistant to respiratory viruses than harbour seals,\u201d said Hoekendijk. \u201cThe greater inter-animal distances that we\u2019ve observed for harbour seals in our study might be a response \u2026 very similar to our response during the Covid pandemic.\u201dComparisons with Covid are telling. Covid is itself a zoonotic disease \u2013 that is, transmissible from animals to humans. A report earlier this year showed that Covid was far more widespread in wild animals than hitherto thought. The disease is also thought to have affected marine mammals, and there are concerns the presence of human sewage released into the sea may spread Covid among seals and whales.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It has been a flashpoint for climate protests given it increases coal production at the same time as the global community is seeking to reduce emissions.Activist investors like Hindenburg typically take a short position in a listed company, which makes money if the stock falls, before releasing their reports which can lead to sustained pressure on a share price.\u201cEven if you ignore the findings of our investigation and take the financials of Adani Group at face value, its 7 key listed companies have 85% downside purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations,\u201d the report claims.Tim Buckley, the managing director of Climate Energy Finance, said financial restructuring at Adani leading up to the pandemic had made it less susceptible to a shock, but the report would dissuade some investors from backing the conglomerate.\u201cIt will hamper their access to Wall Street, categorically,\u201d said Buckley, who has opposed the Carmichael project.\u201cAdani is not, in my view, a house of cards unless the Hindenburg research results in a serious, credible, full response from the SEC,\u201d he said, referring to the US securities regulator.The Australian Securities and Investments Commission did not immediately respond to questions on Thursday, a public holiday. The Queensland government\u2019s resources department also did not immediately respond.Sustained regulator or investor pressure on Adani could force the company to divest assets, as has been the case in other short-selling campaigns.

(That said, the scheme has also attracted other companies, the Guardian included, which have been around for a lot longer.)Toast, for example, which brews with surplus bread, has opened a cafe and tap room called Good Company just off Regents Park in London, working in collaboration with homelessness charity Change Please and helping to train the long-term homeless to be baristas.Certified companies have to be re-certified by the parent company B-Lab every three years to retain their status, a process that is set to become progressively more challenging.

        "text": "Using an indoor wood stove or fireplace increases women\u2019s risk of developing lung cancer by 43% compared with those that do not use wood heating, according to a US study.In the UK, one in 13 men and one in 15 women born after 1960 are expected to be diagnosed with lung cancer during their lifetimes. In the US it is one in 16 men and one in 17 women.The US study found that more frequent use of indoor wood heating led to greater risk. For example, people who used their wood burner on more than 30 days a year had a 68% increased lung cancer risk compared with people who did not burn wood.The results come from the Sister Study, which tracks the health of 50,000 US women who had sisters with breast cancer.Dr Suril Mehta, from the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and first author of the new study, said: \u201cThe Sister Study was designed to better understand genetic and environmental risk factors for breast cancer, but it is also equipped to evaluate other health outcomes in women. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among US women. It accounts for roughly one in five cancer-related deaths in the US.\u201dGlobally, tobacco smoking is the biggest risk factor for lung cancer, but not the only one. This was reflected in the Sister Study findings. The latest results come after tracking the women\u2019s health for an average of 11 years. During this time 347 participants were diagnosed with lung cancer; 289 were current or former tobacco smokers and 58 were non-smokers.Having allowed for income and other factors that could have affected the women\u2019s health there were clear differences in the risk of developing lung cancer in those that heated their homes with wood compared with those that did not. This extra risk was seen in both tobacco smokers and those who had never smoked.In the UK, only 4% of homes that use solid fuel rely on it as their only heating source. Similarly, the Sister Study homes primarily used gas or electricity for heating, with wood being mainly a secondary or tertiary heating source.Mehta said: \u201cOur study provides evidence that even occasional indoor wood burning from stoves and fireplaces can contribute to lung cancer in populations where indoor wood burning is not the predominant fuel source for cooking or heating inside the home.\u201dProf Fay Johnston from the Menzies Institute for Medical Research, Tasmania, who was not involved in the US research, said: \u201cThe new results from the Sister Study provide strong evidence of the risk of living in homes heated by wood combustion. Even relatively low usage was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.\u201dShe added: \u201cThe message for policymakers and the public is clear. Wood heater smoke is not safe. Interventions to reduce exposure in homes and neighbourhoods should be a priority.\u201dThe research adds to growing evidence of the risk of cancer from wood smoke. In October 2006, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified wood smoke as probably carcinogenic to humans. Though far smaller than the Sister Study and using a different methodology, an international study from 2010 found increased lung cancer risk in people that used wood and coal heating compared with those that did not.Mehta said: \u201cWood smoke, from using wood-burning appliances indoors, may contain substances such as benzene, 1,3-butadiene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and other hazardous air pollutants which are known or suspected to cause lung cancer.\u201dIn the Sister Study, gas or propane heating in stoves and fireplaces was also associated with an increased lung cancer risk, but this was far smaller than that from wood burning.An earlier report from the Sister Study concluded that air pollution from indoor wood burning was also a widespread and potentially modifiable risk factor for breast cancer.",

In The Avengers, for example, in which I play the Hulk, the team tries to undo the \u201cthe snap\u201d \u2013 an apocalyptic event brought about by the villain Thanos to eradicate half of all living beings.As a good friend of mine says: \u201cFantasy is not an escape from our world, but an invitation to go deeper into it.\u201d The simple fact is that humanity has triggered extinction events \u2013 and the collapse of the Amazon is a disaster that will be terrible for all of us in real life.We are on the brink of what scientists are calling a \u201ctipping point\u201d for the Amazon basin, meaning that the destruction will get to a point where the forest can no longer regenerate. This is Earth\u2019s endgame. Over 10,000 species could be wiped out, starting a domino effect that would affect our planet\u2019s climate, our water, and food supplies everywhere \u2013 taking many human lives with it. So even if you live on the other side of the globe, this is very much your problem, too.Scientists tell us that we don\u2019t have much time to reverse this \u2013 and to do so, we must protect 80% of the Amazon and sustainably manage the other 20%.Brazil restores ownership of the Amazonian lands of the upper Guam\u00e1 River to Indigenous people, 28 June 2023. Photograph: Andr\u00e9 Borges/EPAThe good news is that there are real-life Avengers showing us the way. Because while we have been playing at consuming and destroying, Indigenous peoples have been conserving almost all biodiversity this planet still holds. No joke: 80% of the planet\u2019s remaining biodiversity is on Indigenous land. Silently, they have proven that the smartest way to save us all is to recognise and protect their territories. But tragically, these Indigenous peoples are being removed, attacked and even killed by multiple villains: hostile governments, powerful lobbies, trafficking, loggers and mining.And this coming week, they will face an important battle: the Amazon summit. Leaders from all Amazon countries will gather in Brazil to decide the future of the forest. And our Amazon saviours will be fighting to guarantee we get all the protections we need.Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk in Avengers AssembleIt is time for reinforcements to arrive from all sides, and for all of us to realise and come to terms with how high the stakes are. Indigenous wisdom says that the decisions we make today should result in a sustainable world seven generations into the future. This is a calling from the children of the generations that will follow us. We are all being asked to assemble and awaken what is heroic in us. Let\u2019s pledge together to help them.We need to turn all eyes to the Amazon summit as a decisive moment for the whole world. The best way to do this is by making leaders aware that we are all watching what they do. And that public gaze is already bearing fruit. In July, thanks to action by the new Brazilian government, deforestation fell by at least 60% compared to the same month last year. Now we need them to commit to recognising Indigenous territories and protecting 80% of the forest now, in line with scientific recommendations.I\u2019ve heard it said that there used to be many \u201cenvironmental issues\u201d. But now, it\u2019s all one struggle: for life itself. Such a struggle reminds me of Avengers: Endgame barrelling towards its conclusion and of the 14,000,605 timelines that Doctor Strange witnesses: of all of them, there was only one in which they won.The odds were stacked against them just as they appear to be against us. But as with the Avengers, only our actions together can beat the odds so that life on Earth wins.

Similar lanes have been taken out by Labour-led Liverpool council, and by an alliance of Labour and Tory members in Brighton.Some councils have also removed LTNs, such as Ealing in west London, although the funding for this came from Transport for London rather than central government.In the letter, Heaton-Harris warns council leaders to make sure any decisions are made on the basis of evidence: \u201cWe have no interest in requiring councils to keep schemes which are proven not to work, but that proof must be presented. Schemes must not be removed prematurely, or without proper evidence and too soon to collect proper evidence about their effects.\u201dIt comes as newly released government-commissioned polling showed apparent strong public support for LTNs, and for wider traffic reduction measures.The research, carried out in Birmingham, Ipswich, Bournemouth and Salford, showed 61% of people supported their local LTN, including 58% of business owners and 49% of those with mobility challenges.More generally, 79% of people backed the reduction of traffic in their local area, with 71% support for respondents with mobility challenges.In his comments, Johnson directly tackled the charge from opponents of LTNs and similar schemes that they simply move traffic to other roads, saying: \u201cOf course some journeys by car are essential, but traffic is not a force of nature. It is a product of people\u2019s choices. If you make it easier and safer to walk and cycle, more people choose to walk and cycle instead of driving, and the traffic falls overall.\u201dThe evidence is in: low-traffic neighbourhoods are popular Read moreThe letter and Johnson\u2019s statement emphasise the apparent policy difference divide over active travel between some councils and the more positive view within Downing Street and the Department for Transport.Duncan Dollimore, head of campaigns for Cycling UK, said the organisation had been arguing for months that councils should give schemes enough time to work.He said: \u201cIt\u2019s tragic that the Department for Transport has had to issue revised guidance to reinforce this obvious point, and councils in Liverpool, Brighton and elsewhere, who\u2019ve decided in recent days to remove cycle lanes without proper evaluation, need to urgently review those plans.\u201d",

        "text": "The governments of Switzerland and France have been accused of breaching the human rights of their citizens by not acting decisively enough on climate change, at a landmark legal hearing in Strasbourg.A panel of judges at the European court of human rights heard petitions from a group of Swiss women and a French former mayor seeking to bolster climate action in their countries. Although climate litigation has spread quickly around the world, these are the first such cases to be heard by the ECHR.In the first lawsuit, a group of Swiss women over the age of 64 known as the KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz (Senior Women for Climate Protection Switzerland) argued they were particularly vulnerable to the climate crisis because heatwaves, which are becoming more frequent and intense, put their health at risk.Supported by Greenpeace Switzerland, they want the court to order Switzerland to set tougher emission reductions targets and to do everything in its power to do its fair share to keep the global temperature rise to below 1.5C.A contingent from the KlimaSeniorinnen travelled to Strasbourg to hear their arguments being made in front of the court\u2019s grand chamber, which is reserved for the most serious and novel cases. Elisabeth Stern, 74, who is on the organisation\u2019s board, said it felt like \u201ca historic moment\u201d.During the hearing, the KlimaSeniorinnen\u2019s legal team presented evidence that older adults suffer worse than others during periods of extreme heat and are more likely to die. Older women are even more vulnerable.The British barrister Jessica Simor KC, who is representing the women, told the court her clients were already experiencing the effects of climate change, which posed \u201cextremely serious threats not just to their health and wellbeing but to their very existence\u201d.She claimed that this breached articles two and eight of the European convention on human rights, which protect the right to life and to respect for private and family life.Marc Willers KC, another British barrister representing the women, argued that the Swiss government\u2019s progress in meeting its existing climate targets was \u201cwoefully inadequate\u201d.He said these goals were in any case too weak for Switzerland to do its fair share to stay within 1.5C. Scientists recently said swift and drastic action was needed to avoid irrevocable damage from rising greenhouse gas emissions.The Swiss government agreed that rising temperatures harmed people\u2019s health. But it denied that KlimaSeniorinnen should be treated as victims under the law and said the link between its actions and their suffering was \u201ctoo tenuous and remote\u201d.It said some of the claimants, several of whom are over the age of 80 \u2013 another has died since the case was filed \u2013 were unlikely to be alive by the time the global temperature rise potentially breaches the 1.5C threshold.Switzerland maintained that its climate targets were strong enough and said the actions it had taken so far \u201cdemonstrate a willingness\u201d to limit warming to 1.5C.Despite her initial optimism, Stern said she was disappointed by her government\u2019s responses. \u201cI almost feel a bit ashamed for them,\u201d she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

He said this was a threat to his life as well as his health.The French government told the court that Car\u00eame should not be considered a victim under the law and called on it to strike out the case.The 17-judge panel is considering its decisions. If it rules in favour of the Swiss women or Car\u00eame, it could order their governments to do more to cut emissions, and its judgments are legally binding.",

This is despite renewables being seen as the cleanest and safest form of power, and having wide public support.Since early September, when the communities secretary, Michael Gove, and energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, introduced changes to planning rules, claiming these would boost onshore wind investment, there have been no applications to local authorities, according to the industry\u2019s representative body, RenewableUK, which has studied data held by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.International competition is intense: other countries are seeking to lure developers away from the UK to work elsewhereJames Robottom, RenewablesUKThe fall-off in onshore wind projects in England contrasts with rapid increases in investment in Germany, France and Sweden.The collapse will add to growing unease in Whitehall after no one bid for licences in the latest auction for offshore wind projects because the price companies could charge for the energy was set at too low a rate.The Observer understands that, with panic setting in behind the scenes, ministers will announce a new framework of pricing within days to try to attract more investment into the sector before it is too late. There is also dismay among civil servants and government advisers, past and present, over the effect that recent government pronouncements on the green agenda have had on companies\u2019 investment thinking.In last week\u2019s king\u2019s speech, the government announced an energy bill with plans for a new annual system of oil and gas licences, despite the UK\u2019s commitment to net zero targets, prompting outrage from the green lobby. Coutinho said more oil and gas \u201cwouldn\u2019t necessarily bring bills down\u201d.Sam Richards, a former climate and energy adviser in No 10, who now runs Britain Remade, a campaign group promoting economic growth, said recent anti-green rhetoric from the government risked lasting damage to the UK\u2019s bid to be in the vanguard of a green industrial revolution.\u201cUnfortunately, the government has been sending mixed messages to industry about the net zero transition \u2013 which could mean we lose out on the cheaper [energy] bills and good jobs that will come from building the industries of the future here in Britain,\u201d he said.Annual onshore wind projects in selected EU countries and UKJames Robottom, head of policy at RenewableUK, the body representing about 500 companies in the sector, said other countries were doing far more to maximise opportunities. \u201cUnprecedented financial incentives are being offered to renewable energy developers by the US and the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cInternational competition to secure private investment in clean energy projects is intense as other countries seek to lure developers away from the UK to work elsewhere\u201d.He added: \u201cThe government\u2019s very slight changes to the planning system aren\u2019t going to bring about a significant increase in the number of new onshore wind farms in England. There are still restrictions to onshore wind that aren\u2019t faced by any other infrastructure \u2013 despite widespread cross-party support to end the de facto ban \u2013 which is dampening the confidence of investors who would otherwise be interested. Local communities that support onshore wind are being denied the chance to benefit from cheap clean power.\u201dIn 2015, before the government changed planning rules to make it easier for local people to block onshore wind farms in their areas, there were 158 new onshore projects in England, involving the construction of 228 new turbines. By last year, only two projects, involving four new turbines, were built in England.Former fracking site could lead UK\u2019s renewable revolutionRead moreEd Miliband, Labour spokesperson for energy security and net zero, said: \u201cThe British people are paying the price of this government\u2019s dogmatic, ideological and self-defeating opposition to home-grown clean power \u2013 in higher bills, energy insecurity and failure on climate.\u201cThe Conservatives presented an energy bill that won\u2019t bring bills down. Their supposed lifting of the onshore wind ban doesn\u2019t do anything of the kind and it is costing families \u00a3180 every year on their bills.\u201dThe government said that across the whole of the UK \u2013 not just England \u2013 substantial progress was being made. \u201cThe last Contracts for Difference round saw a record number of successful projects across renewables, including onshore wind projects.\u201cThe streamlined National Planning Policy Framework aims to make it easier and quicker for onshore wind projects to come forward where there is local support.\u201d",

This eclipsed the other major fish kill in January 2019, which occurred after months of drought and a wave of high temperatures.Durrant-Whyte has warned that without \u201csubstantive change to our regulatory approach \u2026 there will be further environmental degradation and recurrence of such events\u201d.Ceremony held in Menindee to release offspring of native fish rescued from 2019 Darling-Baaka mass killRead more\u201cDifficult decisions will need to be made. These are essentially social and not scientific in nature,\u201d he said.A NSW Fisheries survey in May found no mature native Murray cod in about 300km of the lower Darling-Baaka. While most of the fish that died in the March fish kills were bony herring, which breed rapidly in flood conditions, the impact on native species was devastating.The chief scientist\u2019s report, which investigated the causes of the March fish kills, points to changes to flows in the river, the lack of fish passage ladders, which would have allowed fish to move upstream into the lakes and \u201caltered water use in the Northern Basin\u201d as likely key factors in decreasing water quality and the decline of native species.This is a reference to irrigators and the rules around when they can extract water from rivers, as well as the increasing practice of harvesting rainfall and flood events under what is known as flood plain harvesting.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nOver the last three decades there has been a transition from grazing to irrigated crops, which involves flattening the landscape using lasers and then building channels and levies to trap any slowly moving water during rain events.This is estimated to have reduced flows in the Darling-Baaka by as much as 30% over the last 20 years.00:04:25Menindee reacts to latest fish kills: 'An Australian disaster like bushfire and floods' \u2013 videoThe immediate cause of the March catastrophe was hypoxia resulting from low dissolved oxygen in the water column.\u201cLow dissolved oxygen in the water column was driven by a confluence of factors, including high biomass (particularly carp and algae), poor water quality, reduced inflows and high temperature,\u201d Durrant-Whyte said.\u201cExplicit environmental protections in existing water management legislation are neither enforced nor reflected in current policy and operations. Water policy and operations focus largely on water volume, not water quality.\u201cThis failure in policy implementation is the root cause of the decline in the river ecosystem and the consequent fish deaths.\u201dDurrant-Whyte found that authorities were aware in March of the potential for fish deaths because of the deteriorating water quality, but failed to take action.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not far off, deer bound in silent elegance across the same terrain. They turn to watch us, as if amazed at our clumsy progress. Gaining the ridge line, we take turns to plough a route through the snow, soft and shushing as its millions of dry crystals fall in our wake. We see the crisscrossing routes of deer and mountain hare, and the prints of grouse. Below us, the strath is a patchwork of frosted fields, clustered villages and dark trees. A fine mist hangs like breath above the Spey, gradually dissolving under the mounting sun.On the other side of Creag Dhubh, to the north-west, the River Calder curves down through Glen Banchor, a valley rarely explored now, though in the 18th century it was the main artery north and home to several hundred people. Today, a flock of crows sweep across it, stark against the white world. This hill deceives us every time with its series of false summits, and the hours melt into a thousand snow-sinking steps.

We will make sure that this will not be the case. Everyone needs to know this is not just about climate, polar bears and glaciers. This is about my lungs and your lungs.\u201dCoal, oil and gas release toxic particles when burned that kill millions of people each year. Some of the emissions also heat the planet, making extreme weather more violent and increasing the chances of harvests failing and some diseases spreading.\u201cWhether they like it or not \u2013 whether they know it or not \u2013 the negotiators at Cop are negotiating with our health,\u201d said Neira.Doctors have started to shout louder about the damage that weak climate policies do to human health as scientific and medical evidence has mounted. Last year, the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said subsidising and burning fossil fuels was \u201can act of self-sabotage\u201d.Echoing his words, Neira said there was no longer any way for public health experts to escape debates around energy. The WHO has recognised its importance to health, she added.\u201cFirst, we said don\u2019t give subsidies to something that is killing you,\u201d she said. \u201cThen we said we need to phase out fossil fuels in the name of health.\u201dThe WHO estimates that environmental risk factors make up 25% of the global burden of disease. Strong climate action would also save millions of lives that are lost to other risk factors.\u201cIf you stop burning fossil fuels, one of the most immediate benefits will be the contribution to reduce the 7 million deaths that are occurring due to exposure to air pollution,\u201d said Neira.On top of that, she said, a shift to more sustainable and healthy diets could save up to 5 million lives a year, while cleaning up the transport sector would save millions more through less sedentary lifestyles and exposure to air pollution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Tobacco companies, like oil and gas companies, knew for decades that burning their products was a danger to society but continued to sow doubt in public and fund research to downplay the effects.Neira, a doctor from northern Spain, has led the WHO\u2019s environmental health team since 2005. She has previously served as a vice-minister for health in Spain, advised the health ministry of Mozambique, and worked with M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res in refugee camps in Salvador and Honduras during armed conflicts.At Cop28, she said, the WHO will take a \u201cno-excuses\u201d approach to communicating the problem and call for \u201cno-regrets\u201d investments in areas such as hospitals and clean water.\u201cThe sense of frustration is huge.

Otherwise, it showed little of what to expect from the Gwenffrwd-Dinas RSPB reserve. This 600 hectares of Atlantic oak woodland, glorious though it is, is a mere remnant of what once was a much larger Celtic temperate rainforest, covering most of the west coast of Britain. This kind of habitat is increasingly rare, and indeed it feels aptly precious.Water is monarch here, sustained by westerly Atlantic storms. Rains decant through tree canopies, and creep into cracks and crevices in gnarled sessile oak boughs, while moss cushions trap and retain the water, maintaining forest humidity. Epiphytic ferns cling to oak branches like arboreal hitch-hikers. Mosses not only pave the forest floor, but also creep up fence posts and drape over fallen stones.We followed a boardwalk into the woodland. Green was resurgent, the palette of spring, a mosaic of emerald, olive and sage. Tissue-paper thin leaves, emerging under spring warmth, imposed a gentle, verdant light. If the boardwalk wasn\u2019t a clue enough to marshy ground below, a leafy profusion of hemlock water-dropwort, a few alder and glimpses of dark peaty soil confirmed that water lingers here.The tiny goldcrest has a \u2018fuse-wire\u2019 call, according to the writer Tim Dee. Photograph: Gavin Rowley/AlamyThe boardwalk merged into a footpath. Among increasing cover of willow, downy birch and oak, we caught sight of a monochrome flicker: a male pied flycatcher, with a female perched close by. A male common redstart, its tail flashing like fire, landed further along a fence. A distant cuckoo called, my first of the year. Our joy was complete when we spotted and heard the unmistakable coin-spinning song of a wood warbler.A splinter of sound alerted us to a goldcrest.

        "text": "More than half of all species live in the soil, according to a study that has found it is the single most species-rich habitat on Earth.Soil was known to hold a wealth of life, but this new figure doubles what scientists estimated in 2006, when they suggested 25% of life was soil-based.The paper, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found it is home to 90% of fungi, 85% of plants and more than 50% of bacteria. At 3%, mammals are the group least associated with soils.\u201cHere, we show that soil is likely home to 59% of life including everything from microbes to mammals, making it the singular most biodiverse habitat on Earth,\u201d researchers write in the paper, which is a review of existing literature. The actual figure could be even higher as soils are so understudied, they say.Before this study, scientists did not know what the most species-rich habitat was, says the lead researcher, Dr Mark Anthony, an ecologist at the Swiss Federal Research Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research. \u201cIn my research circle, many suspected it should be soil but there was no evidence.\u201dHe added: \u201cOrganisms in soil play an outweighed impact on the balance of our planet. Their biodiversity matters because soil life affects climate change feedbacks, global food security, and even human health.\u201dSoil is the top layer of the Earth\u2019s crust and is composed of a mixture of water, gases, minerals and organic matter. It is where 95% of the planet\u2019s food is grown yet it has historically been left out of wider debates about nature protections because we know so little about it. One teaspoon of healthy soil can contain up to a billion bacteria and more than 1km of fungi.Researchers used the rough estimate of there being about 100bn species in total. They then used theoretical estimates and data analysis to work out what fraction of those species were found in the soil. They defined a species as living in the soil if it lived within it, on it, or completed part of its lifecycle in it. Other habitats they looked at include marine, freshwater, the ocean floor, air, the built environment and host organisms such as humans.There is a large error range of 15% with the estimate \u2013 so the average prediction could in theory be as low as 44% or as high as 74%. For some groups the range was large \u2013 for bacteria, estimates ranged between 22% and 89% living in the soil.Anthony said: \u201cWhat actually surprised me the most was the sheer challenge of this undertaking, and how much variation there is to our estimates for many large groups, particularly bacteria and viruses, the two most diverse forms of life on Earth.\u201cKeeping that in mind, our estimate is really a first attempt to organise existing global richness albeit with quite a large error to many of the estimates. While true diversity lies somewhere within this range, our effort is the first realistic estimate of global diversity in soil, and we need it to advocate for soil life in the face of the biodiversity and climate crises.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Pollution, deforestation and global heating also damages soil. Adopting less intensive agricultural practices, greater regulation of non-native invasive species, and increasing habitat conservation will all help increase soil biodiversity, researchers say. Practices such as soil transplantations could also restore microscopic lifeforms in soil.Dr Roy Neilson, an ecologist from the James Hutton Institute in Dundee, who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cIt is extraordinarily difficult to enumerate soil biodiversity \u2026 The approach taken in this study arguably generates the current best estimate of global soil biodiversity.\u201cHowever, as the authors note, generating these estimates has been challenging and they are transparent as to the level of robustness of their data, which in turn highlights areas for future scientific investigation,\u201d said Neilson, who is an author on the British Ecological Society\u2019s upcoming report on regenerative agriculture.",

This can occur due to broken or blocked sewer lines. More commonly, however, storm overflows are used to prevent sewers backing up due to heavy rainfall, like that experienced by much of the UK this summer, which has been one of the wettest on record. Last year, more than 1,000 sewage overflows flowed into designated bathing waters.The Liberal Democrats\u2019 environment spokesperson, Tim Farron, described the broken monitors as a \u201cnational scandal\u201d. He said: \u201cThese profiteering firms have been too busy stuffing their pockets instead of fixing basic infrastructure. With all these broken monitors, we have no idea just how much sewage people are swimming in. As millions of people flock to the beach this month, we need these monitors fixed immediately.\u201cThe Conservative government [have] buried their heads in the sand when it comes to the sewage scandal. The water industry feels lawless at times. Meanwhile, it\u2019s children simply trying to enjoy the beach and our precious wildlife who suffer.\u201dA spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cThis government is the first to take such comprehensive action on storm overflows. By increasing the monitoring of storm overflows \u2013 up from 7% in 2010 to 91% now \u2013 we have enabled the extent of sewage discharges to be revealed so that we are better equipped to investigate and tackle it. We expect all EDM monitors to be properly working to maintain the transparency the regulator and public expect. Where faulty or inactive monitors are identified by the Environment Agency, they are then investigated further, and we will hold water companies to account to deliver that.\u201d",

In 2020, renewable capacity grew by 10.3%, followed by 9.1% in 2021 and 9.6% in 2022. This averages a 9.67% increase, more than double that of the UK over the same period.Graph showing growth in UK renewables capacity The Liberal Democrats\u2019 energy and climate spokesperson, Wera Hobhouse, criticised the government\u2019s failure \u201cto invest in the greenest, cheapest and most popular form of energy\u201d and demanded it do more, including removing restrictions on new solar and wind and empowering local authorities to support decentralised energy that will \u201cnot only bring down bills, but also provide skilled jobs for the future\u201d.She said the figures showed the Conservative party could not be trusted with the environment. \u201cThey would rather new onshore oilfields than solar farms and wind turbines,\u201d she said.Roger Fouquet, a senior research fellow at the Energy Studies Institute in the National University of Singapore, said that as countries such as Iceland move towards 100% renewable energy, \u201cits investment is likely to slow down, only increasing to meet the rising demand of power\u201d. However, he noted that the UK cannot compare.\u201cThe UK\u2019s current renewable electricity capacity is below 50%, and has a great deal of further investment to undertake to claim to be a leader in low-carbon energy systems. In fact, 45% of European economies have a higher share of renewable electricity capacity,\u201d Fouquet said.RenewableUK, a leading non-profit energy trade association, believes the government needs to develop a plan to compete with the EU and US in a competitive renewables market.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But now researchers have suggested a similar mechanism may apply to the realm of the nonliving too, underpinning what they have called nature\u2019s \u201cmissing law\u201d.A team of scientists and philosophers say many systems \u2013 including minerals, changes within stars and even hurricanes \u2013 are made up of multiple components that can come together in myriad ways, some of which persist while others fall by the wayside.The researchers go on to propose that which forms persist is governed by a number of selection pressures \u2013 similar to the way Darwinian evolution is based on \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d.\u201cWe see Darwinian evolution as a specific case of a more general process that applies to nonliving systems as well,\u201d said Dr Michael Wong, first author of the research, based at the Carnegie Institution for Science.\u201cOur proposal applies to static systems, like minerals, and also to dynamic systems, like hurricanes, stars and life.\u201dWriting in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Wong and colleagues say that prior to their work there was no law of increasing complexity, despite many living and nonliving systems evolving over time to display greater diversity, distribution or patterned behaviour.For example, although young stars are primarily composed of hydrogen, which is then fused to produce helium, they can \u2013 depending on their size \u2013 eventually generate more than 100 elements.Now the team have proposed a law along such lines, suggesting it is underpinned by a similar mechanism to the one already identified in living organisms.\u201cThe functional information of a system will increase (ie, the system will evolve) if many different configurations of the system are subjected to selection for one or more functions,\u201d the researchers write.They identified three selection pressures that apply to evolving systems: stability, novelty and the ability to continue fundamental processes.Wong said the new law offered a view of the cosmos rooted in function and highlights important relationships such as how new functions may emerge in the context of new environmental features, inviting important and introspective questions.\u201cAfter all, Earth\u2019s biosphere is the most complex evolving system we know of so far. We ought to ask ourselves: what functions are we promoting (or damaging) in our own evolving biosphere? What features of our present-day society are conducive to not only long-term persistence but long-term thriving, and what aspects require changing?\u201d he said.Prof Milan \u0106irkovi\u0107 of the Belgrade astronomical observatory and the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, described the work as \u201ca breeze of fresh air blowing over the difficult terrain at the tri-junction of astrobiology, systems science and evolutionary theory\u201d.However others, including the UK\u2019s astronomer royal, were less convinced. \u201cGiven an immense amount of space and time, and the laws of physics and chemistry, an expanding variety of materials, environments and structures will emerge in the inanimate world,\u201d said Prof Martin Rees.\u201cBut I don\u2019t see that this need be a manifestation of any new underlying principle analogous to the role of Darwinian selection via inheritance in the biological world.\u201d",

A rare superpod meetup of three clans \u2013 the J, K and L pods \u2013 happened off the west side of San Juan Island, in Washington state.Tokitae, the star of Miami Seaquarium, dies after half a century in captivityRead moreIt could have been a coincidence. But for activists like Howard Garrett, who has worked for decades to advocate for the release of Tokitae, there was deep meaning in the meetup. \u201cGatherings like this are often a cultural social ritual to mark a significant event in their community, and we believe they are welcoming Toki home,\u201d he wrote on the Orca Network Facebook group. \u201cShe is finally home, maybe not the way we wanted, but her family seems to know she is with them once again, in ways we may never comprehend.\u201dToki\u2019s death has rippled across the country. There are candlelight vigils planned on Whidbey Island, Washington, and outside the Seaquarium in Miami on Saturday evening.Peta also held two vigils outside the Seaquarium on Friday and Saturday to honor the whale, who went by Lolita in her show business life. \u201cKind people begged the Miami Seaquarium to end Lolita\u2019s hellish life in a concrete cell and release her to a seaside sanctuary, where she could dive deep, feel the ocean\u2019s currents, and even be reunited with the orca believed to be her mother,\u201d wrote Peta president Ingrid Newkirk in a statement, \u201cbut plans to move her to a seaside sanctuary came too late, and Lolita was denied even a minute of freedom from her grinding 53 years in captivity.\u201dThe group says it urges families to honor Toki\u2019s memory by never visiting marine parks and is calling on the Seaquarium to continue with plans to send the dolphin who was Toki\u2019s tankmate to a sea sanctuary, along with all of the other dolphins it maintains.Whale activists are still reeling from the conditions in which Toki lived. In September 2021, the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service released an inspection report for Miami Seaquarium, which chronicled a number of extremely troubling incidents at the marine theme park, including an injury to Toki\u2019s jaw from performances, poor water quality issues, and records and interviews with staff that showed that Toki and other animals were fed rotting fish. Then, within a three-week period at the end of 2021, a dolphin, a harbor seal and a manatee died.Toki\u2019s owners at the Seaquarium had long rejected calls for freedom, saying that releasing the animal into the wild would doom her while robbing her of professional care and feeding. But recently plans to ensure her release \u2013 and funding to care for her throughout her life (in the wild, female orcas can live to 100 or more) \u2013 were gaining traction.Just this week, the whale had started to train to use a giant sling to eventually transport her out of the tank and into a plane for new waters. Sadly, that same sling was used to remove her body when her life ended on Friday afternoon.Plans for a burial or final goodbye are in the planning stages, Pritam Singh, founder of the nonprofit Friends of Toki, told the Miami Herald.\u201cFor the first time in her long life in that horrible tiny tank, she had hope,\u201d said Naomi Rose, a marine mammal scientist at the Animal Welfare Institute, in a statement. \u201cIt is a sad irony that Tokitae died now. Humans failed her.\u201dThe Center for Whale Research, which maintains a southern resident population count for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, gave one word as a reaction to Toki\u2019s death: \u201cHeartbroken. A word that minimally describes the feelings we have,\u201d the center stated. \u201cShe was captured and spent her life deprived of her family and a life of freedom. Thank you to all who dedicated their love and energy to try and change this. Toki will never be forgotten.\u201dThe latest count of the wild southern resident killer whales \u2013 the group Toki belonged to \u2013 is 73, according to the center\u2019s population survey.The Lummi people consider orcas to be their relatives and had long fought for the freedom of Toki, whom they called Sk\u2019aliCh\u2019elh-tenaut \u2013 which means a member of Sk\u2019aliCh\u2019elh, a family of orcas who live primarily in the Salish Sea.\u201cThe Lummi Nation is saddened by the news that our beloved Orca relative has passed away at the estimated age of 57 years old,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cOur hearts are with all those impacted by the news; our hearts are with her family.

The trust must then buy offsets on developers\u2019 behalf.In 2022, the NSW auditor general found the offset obligations the trust took on were increasing every year. It found there was a risk the fund would fall short of what was needed to buy the necessary offsets to compensate for habitat destruction that had occurred in the state.Ipart\u2019s review finds that in 2022-23 only one in five developers secured offsets by direct purchase of credits through the market, while four in five chose to make payments into the fund.The tribunal found developers were paying into the fund five times faster than the BCT was able to find the required offsets.The tribunal has recommended the government phase out the option to pay into the fund and \u201cestablish interim measures to manage the change while the market develops\u201d.\u201cIPART\u2019s report has shown that six years in, the scheme is a complete failure,\u201d the NSW Greens environment spokesperson Sue Higginson said.\u201cThe government must now take immediate and drastic action to freeze all contributions into the fund and develop a new approach that centres biodiversity values above all else.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The plan also calls for new housing developments to only be built with a matching investment in local infrastructure, including schools, GP surgeries and sustainable transport. Housing was, Ramsay said, \u201cthe big issue\u201d in rural areas, as well as in towns and cities.Opposition parties have sometimes accused Green councillors of nimbyism for opposing developments. But Ramsay said it was simply a case of seeking the right sort of housing, not just speculative developments that did not benefit the community.\u201cPeople see expensive new homes being built around them that are out of their reach, so they are priced out of their own community, often without the investment in the local infrastructure that is needed to support them, and often not to the right environmental standard,\u201d he said.Next month\u2019s vote involves seats across England last fought in 2019, when the Greens staged the first in a recent series of big successes in local elections, winning nearly 200 extra seats.Ramsay, who took over the leadership with Denyer 18 months ago, said that even in this context, the party was \u201cconfident of further substantial gains\u201d, saying that success would be seen as at least another 100 extra seats.Much of the Greens\u2019 recent success in local elections, he said, was down to energetically campaigning in long-term Conservative and Labour strongholds where the incumbent party had become used to automatic success.\u201cThey have had councillors and MPs for decades who are out of touch with what the community needs. They\u2019ve never been challenged electorally before, so they get complacent,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd they often don\u2019t know what to do when Greens come along and start campaigning.

        "text": "The German government has staved off a power battle that threatened to cause the ruling coalition to implode after finally agreeing an 11th-hour amendment to a controversial new heating law.Negotiations over the legislation have dominated the headlines for weeks, with the economy minister, Robert Habeck, of the Greens clashing with the pro-liberal Free Democratic party (FDP) over how much consumers should be burdened with the costs of replacing fossil fuel heating systems with cleaner, climate-neutral energy.Environmental groups have criticised the revision of the law, arguing it will delay Germany\u2019s ambitions to reach net zero targets by many years.Under the original proposals \u2013 to which all three members of the coalition signed up, but to which the FDP subsequently voiced its opposition \u2013 from January heating systems replaced in existing buildings had to be green, such as heat pumps or systems drawing at least 65% of their energy from clean sources such as wind or solar power, rather than gas or oil. Every new-build would have had to comply with the rule.Germany plans to ban installation of most oil and gas heating from 2024 Read moreUnder the new proposals the onus is shifting from individual households to municipal authorities, which will be expected to scale up their goals for district heating planning, which often draws on geothermal energy, and to assess the needs of every household, including their suitability for connection to such a system.Pressure was on the coalition to reach agreement in time for the energy law to be put to the parliament, or Bundestag, before 7 July, its last sitting before the summer recess. The draft law will start its passage through parliament this week.Instead of stiff rules, Habeck said, the coalition now had a set of \u201cguidelines\u201d that would help households transition to renewable energy. \u201cIn this way we\u2019re giving people more time \u2026 I think this is the right thing to do and is completely in keeping with my interest,\u201d he said in Berlin.The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, of the Social Democrats (SPD), said the coalition had experienced \u201cjudders\u201d over the intense, often angry debate that had accompanied the creation of the draft, but that \u201cthis has now juddered to a conclusion\u201d.Under the new law, if it is passed, people will still be allowed to install gas heaters from 1 January if they can be converted to hydrogen, including in new buildings, a clause the FDP insisted on. However, in zones of new development heating systems will have to use 65% renewable energy or more.For all other homes and buildings, this requirement will only apply once municipal authorities have presented their heating plans, which they are required to do by 2028.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Last month the FTSE 100 company announced it was abandoning plans to cut oil extraction each year for the rest of the decade.Jamie Peters, the head of climate at Friends of the Earth, said it was \u201cutterly ironic for Shell to be calling anything \u2018dangerous and irresponsible\u2019\u201d.\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, companies like Shell are fuelling both the climate crisis and the soaring cost of energy. They are profiting from the misery of ordinary people while destroying the planet, and they\u2019re making a cynical case to continue locking us into the volatile fossil fuel markets that are the root cause of the energy crisis,\u201d Peters said.He pointed out that the comments follow news of the hottest June on record and searing heatwaves, and argued they \u201cshow just how incompatible and out of touch Shell is with the urgent need to invest in clean, cheap renewables and energy efficiency, so we can all benefit from lower prices and a safe, green future\u201d.Shell last month announced that it would hold its oil and gas production steady until 2030, after previously saying it would cut output by about 1-2% each year. Sawan is understood to have backtracked on the company\u2019s modest climate goals in order to take advantage of lucrative fossil fuel prices which have been stoked by the war in Ukraine.The surge in global energy prices following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine early last year helped Shell more than double its annual profits for the year to $40bn compared with $19bn in 2021.Alice Harrison, a campaign leader at Global Witness, said: \u201cFollowing a year of record-breaking \u00a333bn profits, the only \u2018danger\u2019 Shell would see in cutting production is to their eye-watering profits.\u201cWhether blinded by the pound signs or simply wilfully ignorant, Shell\u2019s CEO is wrong. Ending our dependence on fossil fuels and transitioning to green energy will serve both the planet and provide energy security for all. Shell have once again made their loyalties clear \u2013 profit over people and planet,\u201d she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has also adopted 60 more as part of an effort to study the effect that grazing has on managing grass, brush and other fuel for wildfires in the face of increasingly extreme blazes.\u201cI started watching the horses and seeing what they were doing,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cThey were managing the fuel.\u201dHe calls the project the Wild Horse Fire Brigade, and hopes the discoveries he makes from living among the animals will contribute to the debate around the role herbivores can play in wildfire mitigation.\nWild horses roam Simpson\u2019s land near the Oregon-California border\n\nSimpson socialises with his herd every day and has formed a strong bond with them. The stones (right) mark the spot where he buried one of them, Ariel, on a hilltop near his home\nSimpson argues that the steep decline of herbivores in the region \u2013 the deer population in California has shrunk to less than 500,000 from an estimated peak of about 2m in 1960 \u2013 is a factor in the state\u2019s overgrown forests and grasslands, which in turn feeds increasingly extreme wildfires.\u201cWe\u2019ve lost our herbivory so now we have abundant, abnormally high levels of vegetative materials \u2013 that is what\u2019s driving the fires,\u201d says Simpson.\nSimpson says a wild horse will consume about 13kg (30lb) of grass and brush a day, which helps keep potential wildfires at bay\nFederal protection was granted to wild horses and burros in 1971 in an effort to stop their decline. This quickly led to a population surge and a few years later the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which has jurisdiction over most wild horse lands, was tasked with mitigating the rapid growth. The agency began removing wild horses from public lands in annual round-ups. Last year, 20,000 horses were removed from public lands. Nearly 8,000 of those were adopted or sold, and 1,622 were given fertility treatment.\nA drone is used to monitor the location of the horses. Simpson is now buying an advanced system that will allow him to geo-tag them\n\nUnlike cows and deer, horses are not ruminants, so lack the additional stomach that breaks down organic matter. This means some seeds can pass through the digestive tract intact, and help propagate some plant species\nThe agency spent more than $84m (\u00a365m) on the long- and short-term care of the wild horses in 2022. Simpson believes that money doesn\u2019t need to be spent. He is on a mission to prove these large herbivores should instead be strategically located in critical wilderness areas to manage wildfires. \u201cThat\u2019s a win-win for everybody,\u201d he says.\nSimpson\u2019s goal is to grow his herd to at least 200. He adopts wild horses from all around the country to bolster the herd\u2019s genetic diversity\nSimpson describes his method as \u201cGoodallian\u201d, after the famed primatologist Jane Goodall. He spends every day among the animals, knows them by name and temperament, and is able to record novel behaviour within the species. He shares his findings with an array of niche industry publications and on his website, where he has published more than 150 articles in the past nine years.\nThe legacy of the 2018 Klamathon fire, which scorched 38,000 acres before being contained.

The Klamathon fire scorched 38,000 acres before it was contained. Simpson\u2019s home and immediate surroundings remained largely undamaged.

        "text": "Madrid\u2019s new rightwing city council has begun rolling back one of the flagship initiatives of the last mayor three days after taking office by in effect shutting down the Spanish capital\u2019s low-emissions zone.The plan, known as Madrid Central, covers 472 hectares (1,166 acres) and was intended to cut nitrogen dioxide levels and put people at the centre of the city\u2019s transport thinking.It was one of the most high-profile policies of the capital\u2019s previous mayor, the leftwing former judge Manuela Carmena, and has proved popular with residents, visitors and environmental groups.But the scheme has been attacked by the conservative People\u2019s party (PP), which now runs Madrid after agreeing a deal with the centre-right Citizens party and securing the backing of the far-right Vox party.The new PP mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, has made good on his threat to \u201caddress\u201d the issue of Madrid Central.From 1 July, the city council will no longer fine people for taking more polluting vehicles into the zone. However, it said the suspension was only temporary and could be reversed.Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida and deputy mayor Bego\u00f1a Villac\u00eds of the centre-right Citizens party. Photograph: JJ Guillen/EPAThe environmental group Ecologists in Action said Madrid Central had already brought about record reductions in nitrogen dioxide levels, with pollution from the gas 48% lower in April 2019 than during the same month last year.\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that it\u2019s reducing pollution and has been adopted very willingly by people,\u201d said the group\u2019s co-ordinator, Paco Segura. \u201cA lot of organisations and social collectives are mobilising because people are beginning to wake up to the advantages of having fewer cars.\u201dSegura said protests would be held over the coming days to stop the council abandoning the scheme and make Madrid the first European city to scrap a major urban low-emissions zone.\u201cThis is stubbornness on the part of the city council, which said it would take action on this despite the fact that it flies in the face of all logic and common sense,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a case of pure party politics being placed before people\u2019s health.\u201dThe move has also been questioned by Mart\u00ednez-Almeida\u2019s deputy, Bego\u00f1a Villac\u00eds of the Citizens party. She acknowledged the PP and Vox wanted to scrap Madrid Central but counselled against such drastic action.\u201cWe don\u2019t think it would be a good idea to simply change everything back to how it was,\u201d she told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo earlier this week. \u201cNow it\u2019s up and running, we know which bits of it work and which don\u2019t, so we can listen to people and adapt it as needs be. But I don\u2019t think a total reversal is the option.\u201dSpain\u2019s increasingly fragmented politics is leading parties into awkward and potentially unstable coalitions across the country.On Monday, Citizens parted company with the former French prime minister Manuel Valls, whom it had backed to oust Ada Colau as mayor of Barcelona. Although Valls threw his weight behind a coalition between Colau\u2019s far-left grouping and the Catalan Socialist party \u2013 thus stopping the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left from taking over city hall \u2013 he has been a fierce critic of Citizens\u2019 decision to work with Vox.Tensions between Valls and the party\u2019s leadership have been tense since they disregarded his calls for a cordon sanitaire against the far-right and instead sought Vox\u2019s backing to govern the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda in coalition with the PP.",

So, there\u2019s a trend: if a person in their 40s or 50s, looking fit, ripped, rugged, with a confident bearing, a certain ease in their skin, appears on TikTok, there\u2019ll be a swarm of comments underneath saying \u201cbeekeeping age\u201d.It derives from a Rick and Morty episode three years ago: Summer is hanging with her friend Tricia Lange, who\u2019s watching Summer\u2019s dad tend \u2013 or, if you like, keep \u2013 bees. She calls him sweet, she calls him dorky, she calls him \u201cbeekeeping age, I guess\u201d, she lands on: \u201cSummer, I want to fuck your dad.\u201d A working definition: beekeeping age is anyone who should, on society\u2019s cruel terms, be too old to be attractive, and yet is attractive anyway. Summer\u2019s dad is actually 35, but let\u2019s not dwell on the fact that, to gen Z, people in their 30s, 40s and 50s are pretty much interchangeable.A scene in the Rick and Morty episode Beekeeping Dads. Photograph: Adult SwimThere are people who think it\u2019s a male-only term, just an update of \u201czaddy\u201d (fashionable or attractive older man, coined by the singer Ty Dolla $ign, and coming up for renewal, as that was seven years ago). The manosphere insists that there is no female equivalent, or rather, the language cannot exist for it as the phenomenon can\u2019t exist. What can I say, misogyny is still getting great numbers on the socials. It\u2019s more useful as a gender neutral term, saving the hassle of constant translation \u2013 Milf to Dilf, cougar to silver fox, mutton dressed up as lamb to beef dressed up as veal. What if you merely want some way to express that a person of, say, 48 isn\u2019t as physically repellent as one might expect, without the freight of masculinity and femininity? This is your moment.You also have to be quite fit to be beekeeper age, but within quite precise parameters; you\u2019re in shape because you\u2019re outdoorsy, you love nature, you go hiking, not because, petrified by the spectre of mortality, you do a lot of weights. Beekeepers do not wear crop tops.It conveys a certain solidity and sense of purpose, but it emphatically isn\u2019t about money, which is so often a component of attractive-older-man rubric that it makes you feel bad for men. If anything, Jerry, Rick and Morty\u2019s original beekeeper, carries himself with a certain monastic asceticism. Would a man with a substantial shares portfolio even know what to do with a bee? It seems unlikely, and anyway, an evil version of Jerry, Doofus Jerry, exists in the Rick and Morty universe, and he\u2019s a billionaire; the original Jerry is the living definition of un-billionaire, non-wealth. I like to think of beekeeping age as a post-capitalist reconfiguration, human charisma and attractiveness uncoupled from standardised, time-limited beauty and material assets. But maybe I just woke up on the right side of the bed.",

Dingle pies use leftover roast lamb (and its fat), making them both faster to make, and transforming scraps into a seriously satiating, traditional, hand-shaped pie.Dingle piesMcMahon is a staunch advocate of Irish cuisine, both traditional and contemporary, and his The Irish Cook Book (Phaidon) is full of thrifty, home-cooked Irish recipes. His Dingle pies caught my eye as a great way to use up the leftovers from the Easter lamb roast, so I got in touch with JP to learn more about the zero-waste practices at his restaurant Aniar in Galway. He told me they always try to incorporate the whole vegetable into their cooking, and utilise pickling, preservation and fermentation to save food that would otherwise be wasted. Dingle pie, he says, is a really great way of turning one meal into a different one, using up all the leftover meat, fat and juices.These pies are also proof that leftovers often save a lot of time, as well as money, because the filling takes all of 15 minutes to make. (That said, you could start with uncooked lamb: use the same weight of diced shoulder and simmer it in the juices for 90 minutes, or until the meat starts to fall apart.)Save any lamb fat from the roasting pan, too, to sweat the onions in and to make the pastry with. Also, reserve any meat juices or leftover gravy, and use that to cook the pie filling.There\u2019s no need to use clingfilm when making pastry, incidentally. Instead, simply shape it, leave it in the bowl, cover with a plate and chill. I wanted to make JP\u2019s iconic round pies, but didn\u2019t have the right pastry cutters, so instead I used a plate and a jar that were about the right size to cut around.

Simmer for 15 minutes, until the liquid reduces to a very thick gravy, then take off the heat and leave to cool.In a large bowl, rub the rest of the lamb dripping and/or butter into 180g flour mixed with the fine sea salt, until the fat is evenly distributed in small pieces. Mix in the egg and two tablespoons of cold water until it comes together into a dough, then shape into a ball, cover and chill for 30 minutes.On a flour-dusted surface, roll out the pastry to 4mm thick, then cut out four 10cm discs and four 13cm discs, re-rolling the scraps as necessary. Top each small disc with a tall mound of lamb filling, leaving a 1cm rim all around the edge, then brush the exposed pastry with milk. Lay the large discs on the top of the filling, then seal the edges with a fork. Brush with more milk, then bake in a 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 oven for 35 minutes, until golden brown. Serve hot.",

Earlier this month, organisers of a marathon in the north-east city of Morioka terminated the race midway through after a large number of runners retired due to the heat, with one pronounced dead after being rushed to hospital.Weather observation points across Japan have broken annual records for the number of extremely hot days, prompting the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper to ask: how long will this heat continue?The answer will disappoint those desperate to escape the brutal heat. According to the meteorological agency, the combined effect of El Ni\u00f1o and global heating means that unusually hot weather will continue through to the end of the month and into October.\u201cEven if it\u2019s not extremely hot, there is a possibility that high temperatures of around 30C will continue in October, so people need to be careful about heatstroke,\u201d Takafumi Umeda, director of the agency\u2019s Tokyo Climate Centre, said recently, according to the Mainichi.The agency has also predicted a mild winter with less snowfall than usual \u2013 a forecast that will dismay businesses in resorts that usually attract large numbers of skiers and snowboarders.One location is escaping the worst of the heat, however. In Katsuura, in Chiba prefecture east of Tokyo, the temperature did not rise above 35C throughout July and August \u2013 the 118th year in a row the coastal town had avoided extremely hot days.Human-caused climate breakdown is supercharging extreme weather across the world, driving more frequent and more deadly disasters from heatwaves to floods to wildfires.

Each new chamber is bigger than the last, and you move into it, sealing off the chamber behind you.That is how to live, until you die. In his poem about the nautilus, Oliver Wendell Holmes put it like this: \u201cBuild thee more stately mansions, O my soul \u2026 Leave thy low-vaulted past! Let each new temple, nobler than the last, / Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast, / Till thou at length art free\u201d.This article was amended to correct the depth at which a nautilus can function.

They found 61,672 people died of heat-related causes in Europe between 30 May and 4 September 2022. The mortality rate was highest in Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal.heatwave mortality graphic 2\u201cThere are people that would have died anyway, but those are not counted with this methodology,\u201d said Joan Ballester, an associate research professor in climate and health at Barcelona Institute for Global Health and lead author of the study. \u201cWe are talking about people for whom the occurrence of these temperatures triggered their death.\u201dOnly a small share of heat-related deaths come from heatstroke. In most cases, hot weather kills people by stopping the body from coping with existing health problems like heart and lung disease.In every week of summer 2022, the study found, average temperatures in Europe \u201cuninterruptedly\u201d exceeded the baseline values of the previous three decades. The most intense heat hit from 18 to 24 July, when it killed 11,637 people.Among the people who died that week was an 86-year-old woman called Maria, who lived alone with no air-conditioning, said \u00c1ngel Abad, a doctor at La Paz university hospital in Madrid who was not involved in the study. She took diabetes and heart medication every day but came into the hospital on 19 July complaining of tiredness, he said. She died five days later from acute pulmonary oedema.heatwave mortality graphic\u201cIt\u2019s very frequent in summer in Spain in our hospitals,\u201d said Abad, adding that patients grow anxious as they become aware they are dying. \u201cThe patient cannot breathe.

Unless governments protect people from hotter weather and spew fewer planet-heating gases, heatwaves will become even deadlier.The scientists suggested the death toll in 2022 was particularly high because the temperature anomalies \u2013 the gaps between heat felt today and in the past \u2013 were greatest in southern Europe, which is hotter than northern Europe, and during the peak of summer, when days are hottest and nights offer little respite.\u201cWe had both factors contributing to the mortality,\u201d said Ballester. \u201cIn the end it\u2019s the absolute temperature that kills.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

One study that used daily data for Spain estimated 10% more heat-related deaths for the country than the weekly data suggested. A separate study by Vicedo-Cabrera and colleagues, published on Tuesday, showed an even bigger effect in Switzerland, where the estimate from daily data was double that of the estimate from weekly data.Both the Swiss and Europe-wide studies found that women, and particularly older women, died at higher rates than men. Pollution from burning fossil fuels and destroying nature upped the death toll, the Swiss research also showed. \u201cWe found 60% of the observed deaths can be attributed to climate change,\u201d said Vicedo-Cabrera.More than 2,000 senior women in Switzerland have taken the federal government to the European court of human rights for failing to do enough to stop global warming \u2013 citing the risk to their own health from heatwaves.

That represented a 30% year-on-year increase, slower than the 38% annual growth in sales of battery electric cars during the year to November.Boris Johnson\u2019s government announced a target of 300,000 publicly available chargers by 2030, when the sale of new pure petrol or diesel cars will be banned. Year-on-year growth of 30% in the number of chargers installed would be enough to hit the target, although that would mean annual installations more than doubling to 19,000 by 2025 and accelerating from there.Despite the scale of the challenge, many in the industry regard the 300,000 target as realistic, according to Ben Nelmes, chief executive of New Automotive, a thinktank. Charger companies have more investment coming in than they can put to work, but problems may remain where local authorities are slow to act, he said.Chris Pateman-Jones, chief executive of Connected Kerb, which plans to install 190,000 on-street chargers by 2030, said he expected a further significant increase in charger numbers during 2023, but \u201cmuch more needs to be done if the country is to be EV-ready for 2030\u201d.Local authorities need to install \u201chundreds, even thousands, of charging points in their area \u2013 not just a handful\u201d, while central government also has a role to play in locations such as NHS sites, he said.\u201cScale remains the greatest challenge facing the EV industry, but installing in the right places where there is the greatest need is also critical,\u201d he said. \u201cCollaboration between central government, local authorities, businesses and charging point operators is a prerequisite to unlocking the funding needed for a full transition, as is winning the hearts and minds of local communities about the benefits of electric vehicles.\u201dSome electric car owners reported queues for chargers between Christmas and the new year, during one of the busiest periods for long-distance journeys.

        "text": "Emissions from the motor sector could have fallen 30% more between 2010 and 2022 if vehicles had stayed the same size, a report has found.Instead, the size of the average car ballooned as the trend for SUVs took off, meaning the global annual rate of energy intensity reductions \u2013 the fall in fuel used \u2013 of light-duty vehicles (LDV) averaged 4.2% between 2020 and 2022.A report by the Global Fuel Economy Initiative (GFEI) showed SUVs now represented a majority of the new car market (51%), and the average LDV weight had reached an all-time high of more than 1.5 tonnes.Cars are also getting bigger, with the average footprint of a new model reaching 4.2 sq metres. Automotive companies market SUVs intensively as they provide the most profit: they are sold at premium prices but have a proportionally lower manufacturing cost.Toyota SUV adverts banned in UK on environmental groundsRead moreThe authors of the report called for governments to place restrictions on vehicle sizes to reverse the SUV trend.Sheila Watson, the deputy director of the FIA Foundation, an environmental and road safety charity, said: \u201cGrowing vehicle size is a huge problem which is threatening many aspects of sustainable mobility, from climate to road safety. This report shows that we must move away from these mega-vehicles if we are to achieve the GFEI goal of doubling the fuel efficiency of cars by 2030. Vehicle size matters \u2013 and in this case bigger is definitely not better.\u201dThe reduction in emissions from the motor industry has been driven by an uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), which reached 15% of market share in 2022. The report also said markets with strong growth in this area, such as China and Europe, had the largest annual energy efficiency improvements of close to 6%. North America, which has a lower market uptake of EVs, recorded a yearly improvement rate of just 1.6%.Dan Sperling, the founding director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis, said: \u201cReversing the trend toward bigger and heavier vehicles is key to achieving more sustainable mobility. This applies also for electric mobility, to make the market for EVs more equitable and inclusive \u2013 and to reduce the need for critical minerals and more electricity.\u201dThe authors of the report are also calling for investment in renewables, a reversal of fossil fuel subsidies, carbon pricing, regulations on minimum EV charging deployment and financial instruments designed to facilitate affordable access to EVs. This article was amended on 18 December 2023. An earlier version echoed a misphrasing in the report\u2019s summary in saying that motor emissions could have fallen more than 30% without the SUV trend. Rather than the 30% value being an absolute change in emissions, it has been corrected to say emissions could have fallen 30% more.",

As the actor Amanda Hadingue walks on to a bare stage, house lights still on, and begins to speak about coughs and Covid, it seems to be leading to another postponement.Complicit\u00e9 fans may recognise this unassuming start as a signature move, however, and know not to be fooled. From the simplicity of a single actor at a mic, this show directed by Simon McBurney grows like its own verdant forest. It becomes an almighty and toweringly innovative adaptation of Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk\u2019s murder mystery eco-noir novel, written in wry, profound and glittering prose.With the help of an autocue (entirely excusable given the gargantuan burden of narration), Hadingue plays Janina, a beady-eyed, chronically sick animal lover living in a remote Polish village rocked by a series of inexplicable murders. The dead are all from the hunting club and Janina volubly espouses the theory that woodland animals are getting their revenge.Her friends \u2013 Dizzy (Alexander Uzoka), a former student; Boros (Johannes Flaschberger), an entomologist; and Oddball (C\u00e9sar Sarachu), a neighbour \u2013 are all outsiders and non-conformists. Janina is a fabulous creation, both hero and antihero. She is a thorn in the side of the authorities, shooting off messages to the police and quoting government laws at the council \u2013 a Miss Marple, lady of letters and Fargo\u2019s Marge Gunderson in one. Hadingue inhabits her so fully that we feel her grief over the death of her dogs \u2013 \u201cmy girls\u201d \u2013 as an epic tragedy. Though Janina is, on the face of it, an animal rights activist, the core of this drama is about the condition of being human: how we live and age, our burdens, privileges and abuses.View image in fullscreenProjected nightmares \u2026 Hadingue in Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead. Photograph: Alex BrennerTheatrically, this is a masterclass in how to fill a big stage, in part through sound (Christopher Shutt) and lighting (Paule Constable). The set by Rae Smith emerges organically until it seems there are forests behind and constellations above, much of it created through Dick Straker\u2019s astonishing video design.Scenes flare up out of darkness, with no visible setting up or dismantling. Present and past zoom back and forth so smoothly that it looks entirely seamless. The back-screen is used to brilliant effect, Janina\u2019s projected nightmares of her dead mother appearing almost Hitchcockian.Metatheatricality \u2013 nothing over-excitable \u2013 brings humorous flourishes: \u201cMay I borrow your microphone?\u201d says Boros, who proceeds to tell us his backstory. \u201cWill you turn that fucking music off?\u201d shouts Janina as a stage instruction.Mud, murder and homemade schnapps: eco-thriller Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead roars backRead moreThere are beautiful moments of physical theatre too. A deer is played by actors with raised hands for antlers, and other creatures often come in human form too, which reflects Janine\u2019s view of animals having the same right to life as us. Tokarczuk\u2019s book was accused of inciting eco-terrorism and its 2017 film adaptation, Spoor, charged with being anti-church. It is a critique of religious dogma in so far as regarding the elevated status of human life above animal as hubristic. Janina holds life sacred in all its forms.Crime story melds into environmental clarion call, fatalism sits alongside hope, and cosmic fatefulness against finding freedom, all of it masterfully interwoven and magnificent to the end.\nAt the Barbican, London, until 1 April and then touring Europe until 17 June\n",

The report states: \u201cThere is a belief from UK retailers that there is a sea of plenty out there and if they lose a UK grower, they can just replace it with an import.\u201dLast year, a UK egg market collapse meant Polish eggs flooded the market. Growers cited in the report say the government has not supported them in reaching environmental and net zero targets, which \u201ctied the growers\u2019 hands behind their backs straight away so we can\u2019t compete\u201d with countries that produce cheaper food to lower standards.James Robinson, a dairy farmer who runs a family farm in Cumbria and chairs the Nature Friendly Farming Network in England, said he was frustrated with the government\u2019s approach.He said: \u201cIt is incredibly frustrating, and very disappointing given the promises that are always made by the government and never actually come to fruition. Michael Gove stood up and said that we won\u2019t undermine our farmers within trade deals, and then our first trade deal was exactly that. But that isn\u2019t any reason for us to lower our standards. Absolutely no reason at all.

Temperatures are expected to hit more than 30C this week, giving little respite to fatigued crews.\u201cToday could possibility be a very difficult day,\u201d David Steeves of the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources told reporters. \u201cToday could be a day that is very dangerous for the folks on the ground.\u201dDave Meldrum, deputy chief of Halifax regional fire and emergency, said exhausted crews have been using \u201cwater, raw muscle power and air power\u201d to fight the blazes since Sunday, using three helicopters and fire fighters from the city, province and department of national defence. Even after four days, the fires remains out of control.For a province that typically measures the total amount of the region burned in hundreds of hectares, the record-breaking Barrington Lake blaze, stretching more than 20,000 hectares and still growing, has pushed Nova Scotia\u2019s scarce resources to the brink. The largest ever fire recorded in Nova Scotia was in 1976 and measured 13,000 hectares.\u201cWe\u2019ve got more fires than we have resources to support them,\u201d Scott Tingley, manager of forest protection at Nova Scotia\u2019s department of natural resources, said during a news conference, adding the province is prioritizing safety and human life ahead of infrastructure.Firefighters with Halifax regional fire and emergency work to put out fires in the Tantallon area of Nova Scotia.

        "text": "Tractors are commonly sold to farmers at agricultural fairs and announced in the trade press. But machinery makers are falling over themselves to get a slice of a much more unlikely advertising vehicle: the Farming Simulator video game.The developer, Giants Software, now receives hundreds of queries a year from manufacturers of equipment \u2013 from tractors and combine harvesters to trailers, balers and seed drills \u2013 about how they can feature in the game, where players create their own virtual farm.Farming Simulator is important enough that some firms even launch products at the same time as the game is updated. Search for news about G\u00f6weil, and you\u2019re just as likely to find details of the nine products in the Farming Simulator update pack released last week as coverage of its hay balers in the real world.Giants, based in Switzerland, told the Observer that interest from manufacturers provides it with enough of a revenue stream to cover the costs of game development. \u201cIn the beginning, we had to ask manufacturers to be included in the game,\u201d said Wolfgang Ebert, Giants\u2019 marketing manager. \u201cToday, we have to consider who we can integrate and what benefit there is to the game \u2013 we have many, many brands waiting to be included.\u201dPlayers begin with a barn, some equipment and a little land. They need to grow food, sell it, expand their farm \u2013 and buy better gear.Part of the appeal of the Farming Simulator series, like Microsoft Flight Simulator or the Formula One racing games, comes from the realism of the experience. Yet would-be pilots and drivers are unlikely to be able to afford a jumbo jet or a racing car, while there are plenty of farmers who have bought one of the 25m copies sold who can potentially field-test a new tractor in the game, making it a much more valuable marketing tool.Companies now share detailed engineering drawings of their product with Giants so that it can be simulated \u2013 a highly sensitive matter, according to Martin Seidel, the partner manager for Giants. \u201cWe definitely have to have good relationships with everyone, because we\u2019re on a high trust level,\u201d he said.Farming Simulator 23: part of the appeal comes from the realism of the experience. Photograph: NintendoGiants has resources to include about 500 products in the PC, Xbox and PlayStation games, and 130 in the handheld version, so there are limited opportunities. Players need to be able to buy a three-metre cultivator early on, or a nine-metre version later.\u201cThe really interesting stuff is above nine metres, and that\u2019s what everyone wants to advertise,\u201d Seidel said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to me and my colleagues to be patient and negotiate.\u201dSeidel and Ebert were coy about how much money changes hands, but said their focus remains on the players. \u201cOur main business is game development,\u201d Seidel said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Azerbaijan, which is hosting this year\u2019s UN climate talks, plans to increase its fossil fuel production by a third over the next decade, according to an analysis shared exclusively with the Guardian.The forecast indicates the Cop29 host will grow its annual gas production by about 12bn cubic metres (bcm) over the next 10 years, which is considered a crucial period in which global leaders must cut fossil fuel production if they hope to limit global heating.Azerbaijan owns one of the world\u2019s largest gasfields, Shah Deniz in the Caspian Sea, and the country is expected to extract 411bcm of gas over the next 10 years, according to data sourced by the campaign group Global Witness from analysts at Rystad Energy. This would emit 781m tonnes of carbon dioxide \u2013 more than two times the annual carbon emissions of the UK.The figures are based on an analysis of Azerbaijan\u2019s current gas production, plus its reserves approved for development and those that have been assessed by oil and gas companies but have not yet been cleared to develop. They suggest that the country\u2019s annual gas production is likely to rise from an estimated 37bcm this year, to 49bcm a year in 2033.The conservative analysis does not include gas reserves that are understood to be present but have not yet been proven by drilling, which could still be developed within the next 10 years. It also excludes Azerbaijan\u2019s forecast production of gas condensate, which is a liquid form of the hydrocarbon.Last month, Azerbaijan\u2019s president, Ilham Aliyev, said the country was \u201cconfidently moving toward the goal\u201d of doubling its gas exports to Europe by 2027. It also exports gas to Turkey and Georgia.Aliyev\u2019s government last week appointed a former executive of its state oil and gas company as president of the Cop29 climate talks that are scheduled to take place in Baku this November. Mukhtar Babayev was appointed Azerbaijan\u2019s ecology and natural resources minister in 2018, after a 26-year career at oil and gas company Socar.Critics of the appointment have drawn parallels with the appointment of Sultan Al Jaber to preside over last year\u2019s Cop28 climate summit in Dubai, while still in his role as the chief executive of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.Azerbaijan\u2019s government hopes to fill the gap in Europe\u2019s gas supplies left by Russia after its invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago. But critics have warned that Azerbaijan\u2019s fossil fuel interests have played a direct role in funding the military aggression against ethnic Armenians in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.Global Witness said Azerbaijan\u2019s share of two large oil and gas projects operated by BP had earned its government more than four times its military spending since 2020 when the long-running conflict erupted again. More than half of Nagorno-Karabakh\u2019s population have fled to Armenia in what Yerevan has described as \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d amid a military blitz by Azerbaijan to reclaim full control over the breakaway region.Dominic Eagleton, a senior campaigner at Global Witness, said: \u201cAs we hurtle towards climate collapse, we\u2019re now being asked to put our future in the hands of Azerbaijan, a petrostate that\u2019s propped up by oil super majors and is massively increasing its gas production. We need climate policymaking to be run by climate leaders, not countries with a vested interest in keeping the world hooked on oil and gas.\u201d",

        "text": "Spending your nights sleeping for just four seconds at a time might sound like a form of torture, but not for chinstrap penguins, which fall asleep thousands of times a day, new research finds.Scientists studying the birds on King George Island in Antarctica found they nod off more than 10,000 times a day, allowing them to keep a constant eye on their nests, protecting eggs and chicks from predators. In total, the birds manage 11 hours of snoozing a day \u2013 without ever slipping into uninterrupted sleep.\u201cHumans cannot sustain this state, but penguins can,\u201d said lead researcher Paul-Antoine Libourel from Lyon Neuroscience Research Centre. \u201cSleep is much more complex in its diversity than what we read about in most textbooks.\u201dResearchers previously looked at penguin sleep in the 1980s, which involved capturing them, putting them in a shelter and watching them. They reported fragmented sleep for short periods of time, which they called \u201cdrowsiness\u201d. In the latest research, experts found that this fragmented sleep was sustained for the whole day, showing the penguins are not \u201cnodding off\u201d into deeper sleep.\u201cSleep in breeding chinstrap penguins was highly fragmented under all conditions and positions on land,\u201d researchers wrote in the paper, published in the journal Science. The findings suggest \u201cmicrosleeps can fulfil at least some of the restorative functions of sleep\u201d. The penguins studied could sleep standing up or lying down.Chinstrap penguins \u2018sleeping\u2019 on King George Island in Antarctica. Photograph: Paul-Antoine Libourel/ScienceSleep seems to be ubiquitous among animals, but it makes them vulnerable to predation because they lose the ability to respond quickly to the outside environment. Libourel said: \u201cSleep is at the core of animal behaviour, and is also under selective pressure. Most sleep research is conducted in rats, mice and humans, but working on other species shows us at what point sleep is affected by environmental change.\u201dThe researchers studied chinstrap penguins in the wild using electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring and continuous video footage. Microsleeps were shown by sleep-related brain activity and eye-closure. They noted a slight increase in the depth of sleep at around noon, when risk of predation could be at its lowest.For chinstrap penguins, one parent sits on the nest for several days at a time while the partner is away feeding. Extended sleep may put their eggs or young at risk of predation by brown skua birds or other penguins.The researchers studied 14 penguins incubating eggs, out of a colony of more than 2,700 breeding pairs. The discovery that these birds are doing thousands of microsleeps lasting only four seconds is \u201cunprecedented, even among penguins,\u201d researchers wrote.Fragmented sleep is thought to enable the penguins to stay more alert while protecting their eggs and young. Photograph: Christian \u00c5slund/GreenpeaceStudies have shown some species routinely sleep very little, seemingly without negative costs to their performance while awake. African bush elephants sleep on average for two hours day, and mostly while standing up, one study found. Sometimes they went 48 hours without sleeping.In some species there are differences between the sexes: male fruit-flies need more than 10 hours sleep a day, while females are fine on four, and can survive on less than 15 minutes\u2019 sleep without it seeming to impact their chances of survival.Giant frigatebirds can spend months on the wing during ocean migrations. During this period they can sleep for less than an hour a day, while still navigating and hunting. When they get back to the nest they stock up on sleep, snoozing for nearly 13 hours a day.Researchers wrote in the paper, published in the journal Sleep Advances: \u201cTaken together, these systems challenge the prevalent view of sleep as an essential state on which waking performance depends.\u201d\u201cThe data reported by Libourel et al could be one of the most extreme examples of the incremental nature by which the benefits of sleep can accrue,\u201d the researchers Christian Harding and Vladyslav Vyazovskiy wrote in a related article published by Science. They say the paper calls into question how much sleep can be altered before the benefits are lost.They added: \u201cProving that sleeping in this way comes at no cost to the penguin would challenge the current interpretation of fragmentation as inherently detrimental to sleep quality.\u201d\nFind more age of extinction coverage here\n",

        "text": "The reported outbreak of bedbugs in Paris is hardly surprising. Reports of sightings on the London Underground \u2013 so far unsubstantiated, but quickly addressed by Sadiq Khan \u2013 are not surprising either. Bedbugs are everywhere. Bedbugs can be found in any city around the world, in any location, from youth hostels to five-star hotels. There are not yet clear numbers on the purported \u201cexplosion\u201d of bedbugs in Paris, but in the UK, pest control company Rentokil reported a 65% increase in bedbug infestations in the UK from 2022 to 2023.As we return to pre-pandemic levels of travel, bedbugs are on the move, and this is likely to cause more sightings. They tend to travel in people\u2019s suitcases and end up in our bedrooms \u2013 they are incredibly good hitchhikers. The rise in popularity of secondhand furniture is another way for bedbugs to enter our homes.Another factor that may be behind the increase in bedbug sightings is resistance to insecticides. During the 20th century, strong insecticides like DDT, that were highly effective against bedbugs, came into use, and famously infested cities such as New York and London were able to get the problem under control. But over time the insects evolved resistance, changing the parts of their bodies the insecticides were disrupting. Many of today\u2019s bedbug populations are mostly unbothered by commonly used insecticides.Climate change is also likely to be a contributing factor, as most insects breed better in warmer temperatures; so if there are more hotter months in the year, then there\u2019s more chance of insects breeding in greater numbers.\u2018Although bedbugs\u2019 bites won\u2019t transmit diseases to humans, they are a nuisance and cause stress and mental health problems for victims.\u2019 Photograph: Akos Nagy/ShutterstockI can understand the current public anxiety. But we should try to temper our instinctive disgust. We react this way for several reasons: they invade our personal space, and it can be very unsettling knowing you are being bitten while asleep, creating a sense of vulnerability. The resilience of bedbugs also makes eradication difficult, and it can be a drawn-out process, causing further frustration and distress. But bedbugs don\u2019t discriminate; they aren\u2019t associated with unclean spaces. Thinking this way can create an unfair societal stigma on the victim.What can people do to protect themselves against infestations? When travelling and staying in hotels, keep your suitcase off the bed and the floor, and keep it zipped closed to stop any unwanted pests getting into your luggage and hitchhiking home with you.Don\u2019t leave your clothes on the floor \u2013 and check them, particularly along the seams, to ensure nothing is hiding there. Bedbugs are reddish-brown, and a few millimetres in length. If you do spot a bedbug in your room, ask to move.If you are at home and suspect you have a bedbug infestation, act quickly by calling out a pest controller to get it dealt with as soon as possible. Although their bites won\u2019t transmit diseases to humans, they are a nuisance and cause stress and mental health problems for victims.At Arctech Innovation, a spin-out company from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, new solutions are being developed to tackle bedbugs, including a trap utilising bedbug pheromone. BugScents is a bedbug lure that can trap bedbugs at an early stage of the infestation, resulting in more effective treatment.One thing you learn through studying these creatures is that we live in a bug\u2019s world: we\u2019ll never get rid of them all. There is much you can do to avoid bringing them home with you, but we have no choice but to live \u2013 occasionally \u2013 alongside them.\nJames Logan is professor of medical entomology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine\n",

        "text": "Scotland may conduct an annual airborne laser scan of the country\u2019s landscapes to monitor the health of its forest, peatlands and natural ecosystems, the Guardian can reveal.The Scottish government is weighing up the benefits of annual 3D imaging flights to provide regular data on nature restoration across the temperate rainforests of the west coast to the peaks of the Cairngorms, akin to an annual CT scan for biodiversity.The laser scans \u2013 known as lidar (light detection and ranging) \u2013 would generate a three-dimensional map of Scotland every year. The data could be used to assess progress on climate and biodiversity targets, provide higher quality data for its carbon market by monitoring changes in forests and peatlands, and study how ecosystems change as the world warms.In a statement, a Scottish government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are currently exploring the potential for a national natural asset scan through the repeated collection and delivery of high-resolution laser scanning (lidar) and photo imaging of Scotland\u2019s land surface.\u201cA pilot study over a single Scottish region is being considered as an opportunity to evaluate the information content of lidar-imagery data, and the appetite for its use across government.\u201dDespite billions of pounds dedicated to nature restoration for climate and biodiversity across the globe, monitoring often relies on measurement techniques that are decades old. Lidar technology has been shown to provide accurate assessments on a landscape scale.A Lidar image of part of Thetford forest in the UK. The stands of different tree height can be distinguished, and roads lined by trees are visible. Photograph: Environment Agency Geomatics\u201cFrom my viewpoint, any plan to monitor habitat change on a large scale is fantastic,\u201d said Philippa Gullett, a project scientist at Cairngorms Connect, a nature restoration scheme in the national park. \u201cIt\u2019s crucially needed if we\u2019re truly trying to bring about positive change for the environment. We need to make sure that whatever we are doing [to restore nature] is actually working.\u201dUCLA professor Sassan Saatchi, a global carbon cycle monitoring expert with Nasa, said the lidar scans \u2013 which would involve planes equipped with the scanning equipment flying across the country \u2013 would help build a more accurate image of Scotland\u2019s ecosystems. The technology is already being used on a large scale in Norway, Sweden and the US.\u201cLidar is probably considered a gold standard for measuring the structure of a forest. Lasers measure the tree height and the density of the trees. That can be used as a proxy for the size of those trees that you measure on the ground and you can calibrate this with the forest data on the ground,\u201d he said, explaining it would help Scotland\u2019s carbon market, which is used to fund nature restoration.\u201cIn order for this market to become successful you need to know the commodity that you\u2019re selling. The forest carbon measurements need to be extremely accurate. It\u2019s like barrels of oil that you sell in the oil market. You need to make sure they are accurate because there is a cost associated with it,\u201d he said.Lost rainforest could be revived across 20% of Great BritainRead moreYadvinder Singh Malhi, a professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford, said the scans would enable more scientific study of Scotland\u2019s ecosystems. \u201cLidar enables detailed assessment of forest structure and much better estimation of biomass carbon stocks at the scale of landscapes. But most lidar surveys to date are local ad hoc research projects or commercial surveys. To understand if whole nations are delivering on their nature recovery and carbon-sequestration ambitions, we need something much more ambitious in scale.\u201cIf Scotland goes ahead with regular national lidar surveys, it would really be leading the way internationally in providing standardised and routine quantification of the vegetation biomass of the whole nation, along with additional information such as on the health of its peatlands,\u201d he said.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

And so today I announced a change of direction: I am no longer going to fund Just Stop Oil. Under the current government, protest cannot work. I would go so far as to say that anything that could feed the Tories\u2019 culture-war narrative is counter-productive.\u201cThe dividing lines have been drawn: Labour is green, the Tories are not. A vote for anyone other than Labour, or no vote at all, is a vote for another Tory government \u2013 this time with a mandate to pursue its anti-green crusade. Preventing that from happening is the only way to \u2018just stop oil\u2019.\u201dAs well as funding direct action protest groups, Vince has given at least \u00a31.5m to Labour over the past decade. His funding for both had led to accusations from the prime minister that \u201ceco-zealots\u201d were writing the opposition\u2019s energy policies.Labour has said that if elected it would grant no new licences for oil and gas projects, a key demand of Just Stop Oil, as well as begin a programme of retrofit insulation for 19m homes, which was a key demand of the environmental activist group Insulate Britain.A green policy offering led by Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, also includes plans to quadruple off-shore wind, change planning rules to ease the way for more on-shore wind projects and an upgrade to the electricity grid, create a new public-private energy company and reach \u00a328bn in green investment by the end of the second half of a Labour-led parliament.By contrast, Rishi Sunak last month announced U-turns on a number of green initiatives, pushing back the deadline for ending sales of new petrol and diesel cars and the phasing out of gas boilers, in an effort to draw populist dividing lines between the Conservatives and Labour as his party trails in the polls.Just Stop Oil said most of its funding came from private individual donations. An initiative by Vince to match donations over 48 hours in May raised \u00a3340,000 for the campaign. It has also received significant sums of money from the Climate Emergency Fund, a US philanthropic fund that directs money from donors to direct action groups around the world.Margaret Klein Salamon, the executive director of the Climate Emergency Fund, said: \u201cClimate Emergency Fund is proud to be a funder of Just Stop Oil because we believe that non-violent disruptive protest is the fastest way to create transformative change. While these activists are controversial, they are correct about the science, about the efficacy of their approach, and they are morally righteous.\u201cIt\u2019s time to wake up. These are not normal times. The climate emergency is accelerating, and all of us should be looking for the most effective ways to deploy our time and resources. We thank Dale Vince, and anyone who is willing to support these brave and effective activists, and we hope more funders will join us.\u201dA Just Stop Oil spokesperson said: \u201cWe are grateful to Dale Vince for his amazing financial and moral support over the past year. He has willingly given up his time to help mobilise people to take action to end new oil and gas. We can all see the need to remove this genocidal government from office and so we wish Dale well in his next campaign. However, we remain convinced that politics is utterly broken and the Labour party is tinkering around the edges while the world burns.

But how to keep track of them and ensure the species are thriving? Every two or three years, Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) carries out an ear-notching exercise in all rhino sanctuaries in the country to ensure that at least 60% of the animals are uniquely identifiable.An ear-notch is a pattern unique to an individual rhino within a specific ecosystem that helps rangers and researchers keep accurate records and monitor the rhino\u2019s health.\nHere comes a chopper \u2026 a helicopter is used to dart the highly aggressive black rhino\nIn March, 40 rhinos within Lewa and Borana conservancies in Kenya were marked in a week-long exercise run by the veterinary and capture team from KWS. It included fitting digital transmitters to 10 black rhinos to track their movements and help mitigate human-wildlife conflicts.\nThe team secure a darted rhino with nylon rope, then take its temperature and use a pulsemeter to monitor its heart rate and blood oxygenation\nThe LoRa (long-range) transmitters identify rhinos both in the field and in the office using EarthRanger software.

A 4x4 is normally used for the more docile white rhino. The well-coordinated exercise takes about 10 minutes for each animal.\nNext comes a squirt of an antiseptic spray to prevent infections\n\u201cEar-notching is one of our strategic rhino-management plans,\u201d says Dr Isaac Lekolool, head of veterinary and capture services at KWS. \u201cEach country has its own ear-notch patterns, with Kenya using a V-shape and a hole in the ear.

It is not yet known if the items are linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, but the council has asked the Environment Agency to investigate.The large-scale discovery in Calmore, near Testwood Lakes Nature Reserve, came after an investigation by New Forest District Council (NFDC) into use of land at Little Testwood Farm Caravan Park.The pallets are piled with boxes, with some labelled \u2018apron\u2019 and \u2018made in China\u2019.

        "text": "The increasing popularity of ultra-heavy SUVs in England means a conventional-engined car bought in 2013 will, on average, have lower carbon emissions than one bought new today, new research has found.The study by the climate campaign group Possible said there was a strong correlation between income and owning a large SUV, which meant there was a sound argument for \u201cpolluter pays\u201d taxes for vehicle emissions based on size.Data on vehicle ownership in England showed that households in the top 20% income bracket are 81% more likely to own a highly emitting car than vehicle owners in the other 80%.The top 20% income group drive three times as many miles a year as those in the bottom income quintile.The study found the carbon impact of the richest people\u2019s driving habits to have damaged the climate more than \u201cthose of the poorest\u201d.Car ownership data in the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea found having an SUV was associated with living in a richer area, more so for super-heavy, high-emitting cars such as the Land Rover Defender. Nearly a quarter of the cars in the wealthiest part of the borough fell into this category, against 5% for the more deprived part.The research comes amid increasing concern about the environmental, health and safety impact of the increasing popularity of SUVs, often very large four-wheel drive vehicles that can routinely weigh more than two tonnes.While the definition of an SUV can vary, the proportion of cars sold in the UK that come under the banner has risen in recent years from about a fifth to almost a third.While they are billed as vehicles that cover rough ground or tow heavy loads, previous research has shown that three-quarters of SUVs bought new in the UK are registered to people living in urban areas.The effect of rising sales of SUVs, and the fact they tend to be notably heavier than the traditional models previously bought, means the average conventional-engined car bought in 2023 has higher carbon emissions than its 2013 equivalent, the study calculated.The report called for a distinction between drivers being charged based on greenhouse gas emissions rather than for emissions with direct public health effects, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx).Recent debate over London\u2019s expanded ultra-low emission zone has focused on concerns that cars that emit more NOx are almost always older, and disproportionately used by less wealthy people.In contrast, the report argued, high greenhouse emissions have often been a product of richer people buying huge SUVs \u2013 at a price that showed they could afford an electric car.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This year, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said that, globally, SUVs produced emissions equivalent to the combined national totals of the UK and Germany.In the US, there has been a separate focus on the safety impact on pedestrians and cyclists from SUVs, particularly ultra-large \u201ctrucks\u201d.After decades of decline, US pedestrian deaths have begun rising again, and are now at 7,500 a year, the highest level since 1981.",

Half a dozen bats burst out from their hiding places in the rare wet woodland, dipping and diving merrily through the darkening evening sky.With impeccable timing, a punt full of tourists on a \u201cbat safari\u201d glides into view. The tiny 2.2 hectare reserve protects the river corridor between Cambridge city centre and Grantchester Meadows and boasts eight species of bat, including the rare and endangered barbastelle, along with voles, herons, kingfishers and otters. Renowned locally for its muddy paths past canopies of mature willow and alder trees, rich marshland and unique riparian habitats, it has been popular with Cambridge students, college dons and the town\u2019s nature-lovers for centuries.Now a local conservation group, Friends of Paradise Nature Reserve, fears the tranquillity and biodiversity of this local oasis is under threat. One of the Cambridge colleges, Queens\u2019 College, is proposing to build postgraduate student accommodation on a neighbouring lawn it owns at the boundary of the reserve.Kingfishers are a common sight at the reserve. Photograph: Chris Grady/AlamyThe college is appealing against a unanimous decision by the Labour-run city council to reject its proposal \u2013 which was initially recommended for planning approval in January \u2013 after almost 200 people objected to the development and 2,400 people signed a petition against it.\u201cWe fear that the height, scale and massing of three-storey buildings so close to the boundary would have a harmful impact on both the ecological and amenity value of the reserve,\u201d said Pam Gatrell, chair of Friends of Paradise, which is crowdfunding to raise \u00a330,000 to pay for ecology consultants and legal advice to protect the reserve.MapIn its planning application, Queens\u2019 College pointed out that as the University of Cambridge is seeking to grow its postgraduate numbers by 1% per annum, there is \u201cvery clearly a need for postgraduate housing for Queens\u2019 College\u201d. \u201cMaking best use of college-owned sites prevents the need for the college to seek to acquire private housing in the city,\u201d the application states, adding that this would help protect existing private housing provision in the city.Average rents in Cambridge rose by 12% last year and the average property price is \u00a3585,000, according to Rightmove. It is recognised as one of the UK\u2019s most expensive \u2013 and unequal \u2013 cities to live in, with a near-12-year disparity in life expectancy between people living in the most affluent and deprived areas.

Overall, they said, \u201cimportant strides forward\u201d had been made towards the protection of the marine environment.It was a crucial, three-week-long meeting of the ISA, a UN-affiliated body, which was under pressure to finalise rules governing mining by this month.The ISA\u2019s 36-member council, the body that oversees rules and regulations, decided it needed more time to finalise rules. Last week, in a decision that effectively delayed the start of any mining operations, it said it would work \u201cwith a view\u201d to adopting regulations in 2025. The council did not decide how to consider any application requests that might arrive in the meantime, however, prompting criticism that a legal loophole remained open. In March, the council said exploitation should not be agreed until a mining code was agreed.In a speech on Wednesday, the French secretary of state for seas, Herv\u00e9 Berville, reinforced France\u2019s call for a ban on deep-sea mining: \u201cWe cannot and must not embark on a new industrial activity when we are not able to fully measure its consequences and therefore risk irreversible damage to our marine ecosystems.\u201dMore than 20 countries in the assembly have called for a pause or ban. They argue that not enough is known about mining\u2019s impact on deep-sea ecosystems to proceed. Brazil has called for a pause of 10 years, and several other countries have resisted.Earlier this week, Nauru\u2019s president, Russ Kun, expressed disappointment that the ISA had not yet adopted regulations.He told delegates: \u201cWe have a window of opportunity to support the development of a sector that Nauru considers has the potential to help accelerate our energy transition to combat climate change.\u201dAdvocates for deep-sea mining say it is needed to meet the increasing demand for metals such as cobalt and nickel that are used in batteries powering the green transition from fossil fuels.Louisa Casson, the global project leader for Greenpeace\u2019s campaign to stop deep-sea mining, said: \u201cThese last three weeks have seen important strides forward for ocean protection. Industry really thought this was the moment when mining would go ahead.\u201dSofia Tsenikli, of the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, said: \u201cWhat is clear is that the growing opposition to deep-sea mining has burst the ISA bubble, and pro-mining interests now know business as usual is over.\u201cThe need to protect the ocean from the impacts of mining took centre stage inside and outside of the ISA during these weeks, despite efforts to silence the debate.\u201dOver the past month, the UN high commissioner for human rights, 37 global financial institutions, seafood groups, scientists and Indigenous groups have called for a halt to deep-sea mining.",

        "text": "When it comes to mind-bending aerial manoeuvres, it turns out hummingbirds can give Top Gun\u2019s Maverick a run for his money.Researchers have discovered that the diminutive creatures have two different strategies they can deploy to squeeze through gaps that are smaller than their wingspan.Experts say the findings shed light on the longstanding conundrum of how hummingbirds in the wild manage to pass through dense foliage to reach nectar-rich flowers or tasty insects, despite being unable to tuck their wings in like other birds.\u201cA lot of people think of hummingbirds as being very fast, very manoeuvrable. But \u2026 these amazing abilities are in the open space where we see them. They are just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d said Dr Marc Badger, first author of the research at the University of California, Berkeley.Writing in the Journal of Experimental Biology, Badger and colleagues describe how they created a setup involving four Anna\u2019s hummingbirds and two fake flowers.Each flower only refilled with nectar when the bird visited the other flower, resulting in the birds flying back and forth between them.The researchers then separated the flowers with one of seven different partitions featuring a circular or oval aperture, the height and width of which varied from the same size as the wingspan of the birds (around 12cm) to half that distance (6cm).The researchers presented each of the seven apertures to each hummingbird 10 times, and recorded them making two trips between the flowers each time, resulting in 140 filmed trials per bird.These recordings revealed that the posture of the birds as they flew through the apertures fell on a spectrum between two very different poses.00:00:36Video recordings reveal hummingbird strategies to pass through holes \u2013 videoIn one extreme, the birds swept back their wings against their body and paused their flapping to rapidly pass through the aperture like a bullet.In the other they took a slower approach in which they rolled their body and turned their head to pass sideways through the hole while continuing to flap, with one wing tilted forward and the other backwards.The researchers found both techniques were used on most of the apertures, although for the smallest circular aperture the birds almost always used the bullet-like approach.The team add that over the course of the experiments, the birds tended to deploy the bullet approach more often, regardless of the size and shape of the aperture.Badger said it is possible that the birds initially adopt the more cautious sideways strategy to reduce the risk of hurtling through the partition\u2019s hole and into danger, adding that as it became clear the setup was safe, they might have switched to the bullet strategy to reduce their risk of breaking feathers.Badger added the research reveals how the hummingbirds, which can beat their wings 40-50 times per second, can adjust their posture as they move to fly through tiny spaces.\u201cIt\u2019s just incredible to see how they use flap-by-flap control over the wings,\u201d he said.",

Because, as Christian Horemans, an environment and health expert with the Belgian mutual insurer Mutualit\u00e9s Libres, explains: \u201cIt has an enormous impact on public health and an enormous cost for the Belgian compulsory health and disability insurance. We consider it our duty to analyse risks for the financial sustainability of health and disability insurance, part of social security.\u201dThe insurer\u2019s recent study , carried out by a team that included Belgian and Dutch universities and research centres, compared health insurance claims from 1.2 million people in Belgium in 2019 with particle pollution in their neighbourhoods. The financial results were startling.Europe\u2019s politicians have moral responsibility to tackle air pollution, says WHO environment directorRead moreThe team focused on the costs of nearly 4m GP visits and more than half a million visits to hospital emergency departments made by young people and adults, aged 10 to 64. After removing the social and economic factors that affect people\u2019s health, the study found associations between GP and hospital emergency visits and particle pollution (PM2.5), and when it applied the results to Belgium as a whole, researchers estimated that reducing air pollution to match the least polluted 25% of places in Belgium would have saved \u20ac43m (\u00a337m) in GP and emergency hospital visits in 2019.It is likely that even greater savings would be achieved by meeting World Health Organization guidelines for air pollution, as proposed by the European parliament for 2035.Horemans said: \u201cThe lower the concentrations of PM2.5, the fewer people need to see the general practitioner. So improving air quality not only benefits public health, but also ensures the financial sustainability of the social security system.\u201dThe study also found that more tree and grass cover in a neighbourhood was associated with less demand for GP and hospital visits. This was especially true of cities and accords with wider evidence on green space in urban areas.The World Health Organization already recommends that we have access to 0.5 hectares (1.2 acres) of public green space, about two-thirds the size of a football pitch, within 300 metres of our homes.The urban forester Cecil Konijnendijk recently suggested a 3-30-300 rule of thumb for urban forestry and urban greening \u2013 every citizen should be able to see at least three trees (of a decent size) from their home, have 30% tree-canopy cover in their neighbourhood and not live more than 300 metres from a park or green space.Prof Mark Nieuwenhuijsen from the Barcelona-based research institute ISGlobal, who was not involved in the Belgian study, said: \u201cGPs are often overburdened with patient visits. Lowering air pollution and increasing tree cover may be an effective way to reduce their workload.\u201cBased on these results, we need more, not fewer initiatives, like Barcelona\u2019s Superblocks. Political pressure to reverse urban planning initiatives that reduce air pollution and increase tree cover seem ridiculous.\u201dThe Belgian study only looked at part of the health costs from air pollution. It did not include the impacts on young children, including childhood asthma, and in old age. There is strong and growing evidence that air pollution affects our health from pre-birth, as children develop and grow, and also at the end of our lives.One of the most important developments in air pollution research over the last 10 years has been associations between air pollution and brain health. This includes cognition and attention in children, mental illness in adults and dementia at the end of our lives.Published in 2022, a previous study by the insurer analysed incapacity and long-term sickness from work due to mental health. In Belgium, about one in four cases of incapacity are related to mental health conditions and these have become the biggest driver of the increase in work incapacity benefit payments. The study found links between short periods of high air pollution and the onset of long periods of time off work for mental health problems.",

They argued the EPA had a duty under the Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991 to develop objectives, guidelines and policies to ensure environmental protection from climate change.They won the case and Matt Kean, then the environment minister and now treasurer, opted not to appeal.The survivors group and the NSW Environmental Defenders Office both welcomed the action plan as \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d but also as a first step with more to do.\u201cAs a result of that case, the NSW EPA is now an environmental regulator with teeth,\u201d said Fiona Lee of the BSCA, who lost her home in the black summer bushfires of 2019-20.\u201cWe will work constructively with the EPA to see the plan strengthened at the next annual review,\u201d Lee said. \u201cFor example, the rollout of legally enforceable emissions reduction targets should occur faster than is required under the current plan.\u201dThe EDO\u2019s Elaine Johnson called on other states to follow NSW.\u201cIt is absolutely the responsibility and duty of all EPAs to ensure protection from climate change for all Australians,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat means dramatically cutting emissions and ensuring a rapid and just transition away from fossil fuels.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its spots \u2013 seven, if you are in Europe \u2013 symbolise Mary\u2019s seven sorrows, its red shell the cloak she wears sometimes, when she is feeling passionate or loving, or devoted to her son, or, when she\u2019s in a particularly generous mood, devoted to all of humanity.Ladybirds come from the coccinellid family of beetles, the name for which comes from the Latin for scarlet. They were given this title by Pierre Andr\u00e9 Latreille, a priest who had grown up an orphan and was thrown into a dungeon during the French Revolution and released because he recognised a rare species of beetle.The story starts like this: a physician had come to inspect the prisoners, and found Latreille preoccupied by an insect. Then the story begins to sound like a Bible passage written by AI. The insect was very rare, Latreille told the physician. (It was a \u201cred-necked bacon beetle\u201d). The physician took the beetle to a well-connected local teenager, a naturalist who was so impressed by the discovery that he used his connections to get Latreille released from prison. Within a month, every other inmate was dead from \u201ca notorious killing frenzy\u201d.

In French, Polish and Irish they are still sometimes called variations on \u201clittle cows of God\u201d. In Welsh, they are \u201cshort red cows\u201d. In Romanian, best of all, they are ladyhens. The bird bit is harder to pin down. It may be because ladybirds fly.And O, how they fly: it never gets old, to see a ladybird bumbling along, then watch as it opens its forewings (elytra), which are finer than you can ever remember, can ever manage to hold in your head. They shine; they would seem to be made of porcelain if porcelain could be that fine, as tiny as a baby\u2019s fingernail buffed to a high shine. The shell looks like it is made of material that must be incredibly strong to be so thin, that seems too thin to crack, bend or dent: an impossible substance. Beneath the shell, the soft brown wing.The ladybird does seem god-like, looking down over lesser insects, her prey. She lays her eggs on aphids so that when her babies hatch they can eat those instead of their unhatched brotherly larvae (ladybird larvae look a bit like soldiers dressed in black rubber armour).Conservation efforts celebrated as 26 Australian species no longer need threatened listingRead moreThen again, Ladybirds are not chaste.

There is nothing stopping us,\u201d he said.About 1 billion people around the world do not have access to a healthcare facility with a stable electricity connection, including 433 million in low-income countries who rely on facilities with no electricity at all, according to the WHO\u2019s Energising Health: Accelerating Electricity Access in Healthcare Facilities report, which was published in January, and co-authored by Vinci.Electricity is the lifeblood of a functioning healthcare facility, not only powering devices such as ventilators and cardiac monitors, but providing basics amenities such as lighting. Without these basic facilities, even routine conditions can be deadly or lead to complications. Healthcare facilities in countries vulnerable to the impact of extreme weather events will often experience outages because of storms and flooding.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how many people die each year because of power outages. Nobody puts \u2018power outage\u2019 as a cause of death on a death certificate,\u201d said Hippolite Amadi, bioengineering professor at Imperial College London. \u201cAs we speak, patients in low- and middle-income countries are dying due to power outages and poor lighting. They\u2019re dying because their life-support machines were switched off, or because they have been given the wrong medication by staff who cannot see what they are doing, or because the surgeon working in the dark made a mistake.\u201dWhile lack of lighting puts maternal and surgery patients at the biggest immediate risk, an unreliable energy source makes long-term treatments, such as kidney dialysis, untenable.

This could reflect exponential increases in plastic production, fragmentation of existing plastic pollution or changes in terrestrial waste generation and management.The scientists estimate at least 170tn plastic particles are present in the oceans, with a combined weight of about 2m tonnes.They say without immediate global action on plastic production, the rate of plastic entering aquatic environments is expected to increase approximately 2.6-fold from 2016 to 2040.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "It would take almost 4,700 years for England to build enough onshore windfarms to help meet the UK\u2019s clean energy needs unless the government lifts an effective block on new turbines, according to the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR).Only 17 small-scale onshore windfarms have been approved in England since 2015 when the government changed planning laws to create a de facto ban on onshore windfarms, according to the thinktank.The prime minister, Rishi Sunak, promised to remove the block on onshore wind six months ago but the government has yet to take action to ease the planning restrictions faced by renewable energy developers.Luke Murphy, an associate director at the IPPR, said the ban means England is as far from delivering enough onshore wind to meet the UK\u2019s energy security needs as from \u201cthe start of construction of Stonehenge in 2,500BC\u201d.The Guardian reported last month that Ukraine has grown its onshore wind capacity by a hundred times more than England since Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022.The IPPR\u2019s report found that the English windfarms built onshore in the seven years since the restrictions were introduced have reached a total capacity of only 6.7 megawatts. This is just 0.02% of the onshore wind needed in England based on forecasts provided by National Grid.National Grid\u2019s influential industry forecast report, the Future Energy Scenarios, estimates that onshore wind capacity needs to increase to more than 30 gigawatts across Great Britain by 2030. At the current pace, it would take 4,690 years for England to meet its share of this target, according to the IPPR.The left-leaning thinktank has called on the government to undertake \u201cfundamental planning reform\u201d to England\u2019s planning system to help speed up the rollout of onshore windfarms as well as restore nature and meet the country\u2019s growing housing needs.Maya Singer Hobbs, a senior research fellow at the IPPR and the lead report author, said: \u201cNone of the failures of the English system are inevitable. The de facto ban on onshore wind, the lack of coherence in environmental regulations and the lack of good quality housing are all solvable by reforming the system.\u201dJohn Gummer, the chair of the UK\u2019s Climate Change Committee, the government\u2019s official climate advisers, told ITV News late last year that it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d for the government to reach its net zero targets without loosening the restrictions on onshore wind.James Robottom, the head of onshore wind at Renewable UK, said: \u201cIt\u2019s now six months since the prime minister announced measures aimed at lifting the de facto ban on onshore wind in England and we\u2019re still waiting for an effective plan of action.\u201dCampaigners believe a rebellion of backbench Tory MPs threatens to pile pressure on ministers to make only modest tweaks to the planning framework, which would continue to hold back the rollout of English windfarms.Ed Miliband, Labour\u2019s shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: \u201cFor thirteen years, the Conservatives have prioritised backbenchers who oppose popular, cheap clean power above the interests of the British people \u2013 and their ludicrous ban on onshore wind is now costing every family \u00a3180 a year in higher bills.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the planet gets warmer and the future seems dangerously uncertain, what would you say about who we are, what we believe and where we\u2019re going? The playwright David Finnigan has an idea. Move over Mistress Isabelle Brooks and forget the Eras tour \u2013 this, Finnigan suggests, is the climate era.Often artists will tackle an era with the macro (a sweeping epic) or the micro (by focusing on a key detail, time or personal narrative). Scenes from the Climate Era, making its debut at Belvoir, takes the micro and turns it macro by presenting more than 50 short plays within a tight 80-minute running time. It\u2019s like looking through a kaleidoscope: a whole fractured into fragments.Jacky review \u2013 incredibly uncomfortable, thoughtful theatreRead moreFinnigan is no stranger to putting the climate crisis onstage. A production of his earlier play, Kill Climate Deniers \u2013 a darkly comic look at political inaction \u2013 was cancelled in 2014 after the Australian columnist Andrew Bolt and the rightwing US media group Breitbart criticised the Australian Capital Territory government\u2019s decision to fund the play, which they suggested was inciting hate speech. When it reached the stage in 2018 it was a recursive, metatextual experiment: it turned Bolt\u2019s objections into set pieces and made punchlines out of the death threats aimed its way. It was a restless, dangerous work. Next came You\u2019re Safe Til 2024, a work that tried to temper climate despair with hope. Even his comedy 44 Sex Acts in One Week, a comedy in which the acts were modelled on fruit, turned on a climate disaster catalyst.The cast are \u2018all fantastic\u2019. Photograph: Brett BoardmanNow, in Scenes from the Climate Era, Finnigan can do it all: the dark comedy and fury directed at the government; the heartbreaking story of an \u201cendling\u201d (the last animal of its kind before complete extinction); rigorous searches for, and disavowal of, hope; and a little instructional (but not advisable) information about how we might reduce the number of petrol-guzzling cars on the road.\nSign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning\nThe cast of five (Harriet Gordon-Anderson, Abbie-Lee Lewis, Brandon McClelland, Ariadne Sgouros and Charles Wu, all fantastic) move from scene to scene with disarming naturalism and seemingly boundless energy. With a dizzying number of stories, characters and scenarios, it\u2019s vital that the actors are present and connected in the moment. Without fail they show up to each scenario, whether it\u2019s a friend group spiralling into climate dismay, a group of scientists trying to bio-engineer a new reef system, or a couple discussing whether it\u2019s ethical to have children.The director, Carissa Licciardello, keeps the focus on the actors, and there\u2019s a playfulness suffusing the production that makes its speed a feature rather than a bug. When it\u2019s time for brief scenes of heightened emotion, tragedy and loss, she carves out a moment of breathing room to treat them with care.\u2018The lighting is the real set: it narrows to a point to heighten our concern\u2019 \u2026 Harriet Gordon-Anderson illuminated. Photograph: Brett BoardmanTo help us feel those beats and to keep situated with each new setting (most are briefly introduced with a timestamp and brief description of the characters we\u2019re about to meet), the set is almost entirely bare. Designer Nick Schlieper has kept it simple with only a table and five chairs onstage, because the lighting, which he also designed, is the real set: it narrows to a point to heighten our concern; it washes out over us to encourage us to breathe; it becomes our signpost and our lifeline. When it darkens, so do we. Slowly, another set element is introduced to indicate the loss of options and opportunities as the planet moves toward climate catastrophe \u2013 but it\u2019s worth keeping as a surprise.As a definition of an era, as a play for our times, what does Scenes from the Climate Era offer us? A reminder of how we have been failed by governments and corporations. A eulogy for what we have lost from the natural world and an elegy of what we have still to lose. A reminder, as historical stories serve to do, that the past and future are filled with people like us \u2013 people we will never meet but who still matter, and who experience the world differently to the way we do, and who might make us feel less alone.\nScenes from the Climate Era is at Sydney\u2019s Belvoir St theatre until 25 June\n",

And that\u2019s where the urban model comes into play.\u201dThe starting point for the research was a plan, launched by Barcelona officials in the Eixample district in 2020, to swap out car-clogged intersections for plant-filled spaces that prioritise pedestrians and cyclists. Known as Green Axes, or Eixos Verds in Catalan, the plan ultimately envisions turning one out of every three streets across the city into a green zone.Researchers calculated that the plan, if fully implemented, could boost green space across the city by 5.7%. Using a framework established by previous studies that linked green spaces to mental health, they crunched the numbers on the potential impact of the Barcelona plan.\u201cWhat we found was that \u2013 even though we\u2019re only increasing the green [space] by about 5 or 6% \u2013 you get quite a considerable reduction in the number of cases of mental health problems,\u201d said Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, a co-author of the paper, also with the Barcelona institute.Their modelling estimated that the surge in vegetation could prevent as many as 31,000 cases of \u201cpoor mental health\u201d, decrease the number of visits to mental health specialists by 13% and reduce the use of tranquillisers and sedatives by 8% annually. The result could translate to savings of as much as \u20ac45m a year in direct and indirect mental health costs.The estimates came with caveats: the green interventions need to be evenly distributed across the city and accompanied by policies that foster high-quality public transport systems and low-emissions zones as well as strategies to prevent speculation and gentrification.While the findings offer a potent argument for increasing green space in a city where just 20% of the population meet the WHO\u2019s recommendation for access to green space and where air pollution remains chronically high, not everyone is seemingly onboard, according to Nieuwenhuijsen.\u201cUnfortunately what we see at the moment is going the other way,\u201d he said, pointing to recent reports of plans by regional authorities in Catalonia to cut down more than 100 trees in one of the city\u2019s central parks in order to make way for a train station.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Governments in Sweden and Britain have faced heavy criticism for backtracking on green pledges, and on Tuesday Ursula von der Leyen, the EU Commission president, welcomed a deal by EU governments to water down rules on vehicle emissions.\u201cEurope is facing a make-or-break moment in terms of whether it is willing to pay the costs \u2013 both financial and political \u2013 of moving forward with the next phase of decarbonisation at the speed and according to the model it has set out in the European green deal,\u201d write authors Susi Dennison, an ECFR senior policy fellow, and analyst and writer Mats Engstr\u00f6m.To make the case for decarbonisation, the report recommends that policymakers should focus on energy sovereignty and how the green industrial transformation can help make their countries more economically competitive. It also suggests focusing on how EU financial support can contribute to a fair transition, along with the risks of the climate crisis.\u201cThe EU stands to benefit from being a global green leader, but it needs to rapidly adapt its policy instruments to the changed geopolitical circumstances,\u201d the report added.While public support for action on the climate remains high across the continent, uncertainty about energy prices and supply means it is increasingly facing cost and competitiveness challenges.Before the European parliament elections in June, Poland, Slovakia, the Netherlands and Austria have elections, as well as potentially Croatia and Romania.Meanwhile, the report warns that Italy, Sweden, Finland and Greece all have governments that include or depend on forces that \u201cexplicitly prioritise national interests and are more wary of what they perceive as an internationalist agenda\u201d.Despite the changed geopolitical environment since the adoption of the strategic agenda for the European Green Deal in 2019, Europe would lose out considerably if it were to water down its plans \u2013 particularly to the US and China.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Targets to clean up the majority of England\u2019s rivers, lakes and coastal waters suffering from a cocktail of agricultural and sewage pollution have been pushed back from 2027 to 2063.Not one English waterway, including rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters is in good ecological and chemical health at present, with pollution from water treatment plants and agriculture the key sources of the damage. The Environment Agency said on Thursday \u00a35.3bn was being invested for the next five years to stop the further deterioration of waterways.But the summary documents within the plan reveal the target for all 3,651 water bodies to achieve good chemical and ecological status \u2013 a state in which they are as close to their natural state as possible \u2013 was now decades away in 2063.Until Brexit the UK government was signed up to the water framework directive, which required countries to make sure all their waters achieved \u201cgood\u201d chemical and ecological status by 2027 at the latest. The UK government later reduced the target to 75% of waterways reaching the single test of good ecological status by 2027 at the latest. The target for the majority of waterways to achieve good status in both chemical and ecological tests has now been pushed back to 2063, according to the documents.By 2027, only 4% of waters are currently on track to be in good overall condition.The Wildlife Trusts said the new river basin management plans were the third instalment of proposals to restore nearly 5,000 rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters across England. Both previous plans from 2009 and 2015 were supposed to oversee the recovery of a large proportion of these waters by 2015 and 2021 \u2013 but the targets were missed and pushed back.Ali Morse, water policy manager for the Wildlife Trusts, said this new target of 2063 meant rivers, lakes and coastal waters would not be healthy within the lifetimes of many people. \u201cFor too long we have allowed our rivers and lakes to become poisoned, decimating aquatic wildlife and habitats.\u201cWe need ambitious targets to repair the immense damage inflicted on our natural world. Instead, the government is comfortable with kicking action on rivers into the long grass. At this rate, a great deal of us will not see England\u2019s rivers and lakes given a clean bill of health in our lifetimes \u2013 and that is nothing short of a tragedy.\u201dThe latest state of rivers and lakes released by the Environment Agency in 2020 shows that only 16% meet the criteria for good ecological status and no surface water bodies are deemed to meet the criteria for achieving good chemical status. Both criteria are required for a waterway to be deemed as in a good state - thus no river, lake or coastal water is judged to be in a good state at present.The Environment Agency said on Thursday the \u00a35.3bn being invested in the river basin management plans into waterways over the next five years would help protect and enhance England\u2019s waters, tackling the impacts of pollution and climate change. The plans are legally-binding and aimed at tackling the key threats to rivers and coastal waters which are water company pollution, agricultural pollution, climate change and population growth.But if no progress is made the EA said only 6% of rivers, lakes and coastal waters would be in a good ecological state by 2043.John Leyland, EA executive director said: \u201cWhilst progress has been made to protect and enhance England\u2019s waters, it is clear that considerable time and investment will still be needed if we are to see the further improvement in our water environment that we all want.\u201dThe \u00a35.3bn action plan to 2027 was already funded, the EA said. It included \u00a34.3bn of action by water companies and more than \u00a3500m to mitigate the impacts of agriculture on the water environment.The Wildlife Trusts said pressures from water demand and pollution were incessant; from record-breaking temperatures and low rainfall, to the overuse of storm overflows to release raw sewage into rivers, even at times of dry conditions. The latter, the trusts said, were a clear sign that investment in sewage infrastructure had not kept pace with what was needed.Morse said the reason for what was an extremely long road to recovery of river health outlined in the new plans was in the majority of cases, chemical pollution. Waterways are polluted by chemicals from landfill sites, urban runoff or agriculture, and when these chemicals have already reached the environment, there was very little that could be done to remove them, she said.",

Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAThe beavers, which were held at Five Sisters Zoo for health screening after arriving from the River Tay catchment in Scotland, were released into a tributary of the River Wansbeck on the National Trust\u2019s Wallington estate in Northumberland. It follows successful releases on Exmoor in 2020 and the South Downs in 2021.Beavers were once a mainstay of British rivers but were hunted for their fur, meat and scent glands to extinction in the 16th century.The Wallington beavers, in a 24-hectare fenced enclosure, become one of very few beaver populations in northern England, and everyone expects them instinctively to begin engineering and improving the landscape.National Trust rangers attempted to give them a head start by laying willow branches over the stream and putting down hay.

What real jackasses you are!\u2019 he\u2019d say with a hearty laugh that reverberated through the apartment, then he\u2019d eat the pear in two bites.\u201dYou can feel it: the almost alcoholic impression a very ripe pear leaves somewhere between your throat and your lungs, a smell more than a taste. It\u2019s the thing that makes a pear drop a pear drop. It\u2019s the thing that makes it feel like you breathed the pear in, that a moment ago it was a piece of fruit in a dark and golden painting, then it was gone.But there is evidence: the stem, the thing that reminds you that the fruit once weighed down a branch in a heavy orchard, something happening to move that weight from the soil to the trees, to move down again, the pear seeming to weigh itself down with that shape, a drop of water falling back to the ground.The word pear comes from the Vulgar Latin word pira. In biology class we learned that the hard bits, especially in an unripe pear, are called sclereid bundles, or stone cells. We looked at them under the microscope, focusing the lens until the blurred dots turned to thin lines: dead cells with thick walls.Sometimes (especially when I am hungover) I feel my mind is a microscope, zooming in and zooming out, from the simple explanation to the more complicated one. Let us have a debate, someone in there announces, and it begins. Perhaps the explanation is this \u2013 but it could equally be this \u2013 No no, my dear fellow, it is clearly this \u2013 No sir, your reasoning, like your Latin, is vulgar!

        "text": "It started with the monkeys. The Zoological Society of London, which I head, received a grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to repurpose our Snowdon Aviary in London Zoo into an enclosure for colobus monkeys. This grant also enabled us to offer 100,000 heavily discounted tickets to community groups. We extended this so that anyone on benefits could buy a ticket for \u00a33, which is a tenth of the cost of peak-season entry for an adult.News of the \u00a33 offer spread fast, and on the first day of February half-term it became clear that something extraordinary was happening. Literally thousands of families were descending on our zoos. Both London and Whipsnade had twice as many visitors as we had been expecting.As I surveyed the queue, stretching around the edge of Regent\u2019s Park as far as I could see, I had mixed feelings. One part of me was horrified that our visitors were having to wait so long to get in. But another saw a physical expression of something powerful and good that has changed our zoos overnight. The queues marked the moment when our conservation zoos opened to all, including those who could not have previously afforded to visit.We worked quickly to bring the situation under more control. We moved to online booking only. We set up separate queues for our members. We brought in more staff, and put a cap on the numbers in both zoos, so we could ensure all our visitors had a positive experience.And the experience has been an overwhelmingly positive one. In half-term week alone, we had 133,000 visitors to our zoos, more than 50,000 of them on \u00a33 tickets. Dozens of those families told us how much it meant to them to be there. Our staff are visibly energised by what\u2019s happened, if exhausted by the unexpected numbers.I saw toddlers grinning with delight when a penguin swam over to investigate the bright colours of their winter coats. I heard gasps from whole families when our tiger cubs rolled over to show their soft bellies. I watched grownups jump in shock when Bhanu, our male Asiatic lion, thundered his roar (which can be heard up to three miles away). Speaking to these families, I discovered they were all new visitors to our conservation zoos. It was the first time that their children had been up close with wildlife.Three weeks in, it would be hubristic to be drawing grand conclusions. But I do think our \u00a33 tickets will change us, for the better. The scheme has made us more accessible, our zoos busier and our staff happier.As a conservation charity, we are reliant on visitors and supporters to fund our scientific research and fieldwork. We have teams working to restore mangroves in the Philippines; protect pangolins in central Africa; reintroduce hazel dormice to the English countryside; and map the seabed off Greenland. Engaging people is also core to our charity. This scheme has increased visitor numbers, engagement and our income, allowing us to do even more conservation work in the field.There are risks and downsides to all this. We have had complaints from visitors who aren\u2019t on benefits, and it is true that such a blunt test can feel unfair to those just on the wrong side of the line. We will need to make sure that the \u00a33 tickets aren\u2019t cannibalising demand for our full-price ones \u2013 we cannot afford to reduce our income, as that would mean doing less conservation work. We will continue the \u00a33 ticket scheme for now, and look for funding to help us to do so.But for all the queues and challenges, this has been a brilliant development. This view was sealed for me by the headteacher of a primary school in Somers Town, one of the most deprived parts of the capital.

        "text": "It is sad to see George Monbiot labelling all people with logical objections to low-traffic neighbourhoods as barbarians, myth-makers and rightwing debate-deniers (Ignore the culture warriors \u2013 low traffic neighbourhoods don\u2019t close streets, they liberate them, 3 August). Most of the derisive comments he makes could just as easily be applied to those who aggressively champion their pro-LTN positions and justify pushing traffic and pollution from their emptied streets on to neighbours\u2019 residential roads as an \u201cexpansion of community space\u201d. It\u2019s exactly this kind of absolutist position that has fuelled the culture wars he describes.In Dulwich, south London, closing the main road between east and west without consultation has physically and socially divided the community, damaged local shops and businesses, and increased traffic congestion on surrounding residential roads. In fact, a recent TfL report described the Dulwich LTN as the root cause of congestion on local main roads, which has in turn reduced the frequency of the local bus service on which we all depend.The Dulwich LTN has helped some, but hurt others. Because of increased congestion on the roads that are now getting all the traffic, vulnerable residents struggle to get to medical appointments, and air quality is worse for thousands of children walking and cycling to school. Richard AldwinckleDulwich, London George Monbiot puts opposition to LTNs down to the influence of angry men across the Atlantic with hard-right politics, which only serves to alienate any democratic opposition. I write as a seventysomething who has lived in Lewisham, south London, since 1970 and always voted Labour in local elections until the most recent election, when I voted Liberal Democrat. My decision was solely based on my lived experience and the impact that LTNs have had on my family.The neighbouring LTN, which has its boundary only metres from my front door, resulted in massively increased journey times whether by car or bus to our local hospital, supermarket and family in the borough. Despite Monbiot\u2019s statistics, LTNs generate traffic displacement, which pushes air pollution down the road on to already polluted and congested routes. LTNs are not a panacea for the environmental challenges that we face.After the imposition of LTNs, I wrote to all my local councillors, and the mayors of Lewisham and Greater London. Not once did I receive a reply that in any way engaged with the points I tried to make \u2013 principally, to ask politicians to produce a bigger solution and not divide local communities with arbitrary boundaries, metal bollards and planters. For example, a tiered extension of the congestion charge zones from central London out to the M25 boundary might be worth considering, albeit politically tough. LTNs are not working for the many who live outside of those areas.Richard WigginsLewisham, London Instead of creating low-traffic zones, which have many disadvantages, has the city of Oxford considered making all bus travel in the city free and at the same time making parking in the park-and-ride sites a lot cheaper? It would probably cost the council less than all the hardware that has to be installed to control car traffic in the zones, and would solve the congestion problem as well.Joanna DodsworthBrill, Buckinghamshire",

One species of galaxias was also added to the endangered category.They include the short-tail galaxias, the tapered galaxias and the East Gippsland and West Gippsland galaxias, with the additions taking the total number of fish listed as critically endangered under national laws to 18.\u201cThese freshwater fish are some of Australia\u2019s most vulnerable animals, with almost all of them being assessed as having a greater than 50% chance of going extinct in the wild in the next 20 years,\u201d the conservation director at the Invasive Species Council, James Trezise, said.Soaring, leaping, swooping \u2026 a world of wildlife by the world\u2019s top photographersRead more\u201cIf we are serious about stopping extinctions, then we need to tackle the major threats that are driving declines of our native animals.\u201cScientists have recommended a threat abatement plan be established for freshwater pest fish, yet this hasn\u2019t happened.\u201dThe decision to list the species follows a raft of assessments that occurred in the aftermath of the 2019-20 bushfire disaster.The newly listed fish were once thought to be a single species, known as the mountain galaxias, but work by Tarmo Raadik, a senior research scientist at Victoria\u2019s Arthur Rylah Institute, described the animals as distinct species.The biggest threat to galaxiid species is invasive trout, which have caused the range of many of the fish to contract to extremely small areas, often in headwaters above waterfalls where trout are excluded.Many have only one population left, putting them at extreme risk of extinction.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s only a single population any normal disturbance that may occur in a forest such as a fire or sedimentation from a flood can knock out the whole population,\u201d Raadik said.\u201cThe other issue of being forced to these small single areas is genetic decline, they become inbred because you\u2019ve got no genetic recruitment coming in from elsewhere.\u201dMark Lintermans, an associate professor at the University of Canberra, said some of the streams galaxias were now found in were tiny pools measuring a metre in width and 10cm deep.\u201cSo you have a drought and the stream dries up,\u201d he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "When I did the Ten Tors challenge at school in 2013, I would fight back tears with my teammates, anticipating the relief and joy we would feel at crossing the finish line after 45 miles of backpacking on Dartmoor. On Friday, different tears fell. Messages flooded my phone announcing that the right to wild camp on Dartmoor had been overturned in an astonishing defeat.The now infamous high court case in London, instigated by the hedge fund manager Alexander Darwall, saw victory for landowners, who can now choose to grant (or not to grant) campers a quiet night under the stars. Now, there is nowhere to legally wild camp in England or Wales. The windswept fury of Dartmoor was the stage of its extinction.Until Friday, an assumed right to wild camp under a bylaw in the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985 saw thousands of people enjoying this most basic, fundamental form of human recreation \u2013 without having to seek landowners\u2019 permission. The rules of the countryside code were simple: pitch your tent away from the road as the light fades, no open flames, and leave in the morning without a trace.For Darwall, Dartmoor\u2019s sixth-largest landowner, the right to wild camp in England\u2019s largest national park never existed. For someone like me, who has spent a young lifetime walking Dartmoor\u2019s landscape, what does that mean? The friendships formed in howling winds and under red skies, the boy I met and will marry, the questions I\u2019ve yelled, the answers I\u2019ve found, the shelters from the storm \u2013 were they all in my head?This loss leaves the kind of grief that only nature can muster \u2013 and sustain. This grief is fuelling a wildfire of outrage in all who have been touched by the moors. A crowdfund to assist Dartmoor National Park Authority in appealing against the verdict has been shared by millions online since Friday and is gaining impressive momentum.People are right to be angry. Britain\u2019s wildlife, and the right to enjoy it, are under attack. Britain has lost more biodiversity than any other G7 nation, and ranks bottom in Europe for nature connectedness. The Right To Roam campaign, which advocates for better access to nature in England, reminds us that we are banned from 92% of English land.Meanwhile, Scotland shows us a successful alternative to restrictive English laws, with a national \u201cright to roam\u201d \u2013 despite nearly 60% of its land being privately owned. Just 9% of England is built upon, leaving ample space for wiser, smarter, more mutually beneficial choices. The pressure is on to protect the natural world and improve its resilience, but how can we advocate for a natural world we are forbidden from knowing?Darwall cited concern over littering and pollution on his estate, framed by a vague desire to restore nature. And yet banning innocent recreation such as wild camping isn\u2019t just banning the act of pitching a tent; it\u2019s removing the chance for public environmental guardianship. I wonder, if I wanted to stalk deer, or blast a few pheasants on his 1,400-hectare (3,450 acres) Blachford estate, would I be welcomed with open arms?New measures to silence climate activists? They\u2019ll only spur us on | Indigo RumbelowRead moreA recent statement from the Darwalls claimed that they never intended to ban camping on Dartmoor, but rather hope to work together on a \u201cmutually satisfactory arrangement\u201d. Well, consider this a new beginning, where a campaign for national right to roam legislation and a new countryside code improves sustainable, responsible access to nature for the entire population across England and Wales. We shall not be subjected to curfews. Instead, see this as an invitation to walk with us, and restore our severed line to nature with the lightest of touches.As the writer and activist Amy-Jane Beer recently advised, in some sense we should be thanking Alexander and Diana Darwall for making us confront the staggering lack of access to nature in England. Writers, celebrities, activists, hikers, climbers, ramblers and cyclists have rallied to support the right to roam movement with remarkable force, inspired by a fierce love for the landscape.Little did we realise that Dartmoor has been preparing us for this moment for decades: granite steeling our resolve. We rise from defeat with a rooted desire for us and future generations to be trusted by landowners such as Darwall, and look forward to the day when we have the right to freely return to our seat under its ebony skies.\nSophie Pavelle is a writer and science communicator\n",

This development is, of course, welcome, if long overdue. But it doesn\u2019t really change anything. Who will ever be able to forget the chainsaws? Beloved limes and sycamores are gone. Most of us will be long dead before their replacements reach anything like maturity.Thinking about this horrible, unnecessary business all over again, I\u2019m struck by the default accusations of nimbyism on the council\u2019s part, an attitude that persists even now. In its statement, it said that it had misrepresented those who protested against the destruction as \u201cprimarily interested only in their own streets\u201d.I know this is true; most activists cared about neighbourhoods far beyond their own. But I also wonder why the council believes it might be morally dubious for a person to worry about his or her own street? Isn\u2019t this where community begins? Each street is part of a village \u2013 Sheffield is famously a collection of villages \u2013 and these villages make up the city.Councils, it seems to me, deploy the word community only when it suits. Recently, I waited for an hour at the library to talk to our (Labour) councillor about low traffic zones. As someone who is in favour of LTZs, but finds herself sandwiched between two of them, I wanted to know how it is decided who will benefit from such schemes, and who will be their victims. But from the moment I opened my mouth, I understood I was wasting my breath. To ask questions, let alone to have feelings, about the place where you live is increasingly framed as naked self-interest by politicians on the left, the idea being, I think, that if you make people (your own voters!) feel mean and inconsiderate, shame will silence them, and you can then get on with doing whatever you like.To absent friendsMuch missed: Virago\u2019s founder, Carmen Callil.

But there is a painful absence: my friend Carmen Callil, the publisher\u2019s founder, who died last year.More than once, I imagine I hear the sound of her laughter. How I wish she was in this hot, crowded room to make wild introductions and even wilder pronouncements \u2013 and that we could gossip about this amazing gathering of women (and some men) together later.Serious reservationsYou\u2019re booked \u2026 Photograph: 10\u2019000 Hours/Getty ImagesThe neurotic messages we receive in advance of almost any visit to a restaurant \u2013 your booking is approaching; please confirm your booking; thank you for confirming your booking \u2013 are still annoying.

But we [the House of Commons cross-party environment food and rural affairs select committee] will be discussing what course of action to take after the Easter recess.\u201d Defra\u2019s farm minister, Mark Spencer, said he had met the FSA and hoped it would deliver a criminal prosecution. \u201cWe will be keeping a close eye on the investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll leave that with the Food Standards Agency to deliver a criminal prosecution.\u201dSpencer said he would not make any further statement on Thursday because of the \u201congoing criminal investigation\u201d that involved \u201cvery serious allegations\u201d that the FSA had a responsibility to investigate. Spencer said he was in regular contact with the meat industry and the FSA.The Farmers Weekly investigation found that tens of thousands of tonnes of foreign pork mislabelled as British had been finding its way into the supply chain each week. The supplier has been accused by former employees of regularly \u201cwashing\u201d visibly bad hams in saltwater, and of mixing rotting pork with fresh product for further processing.On Wednesday, Darren Davies, the head of the FSA\u2019s national food crime unit (NFCU), said the agency was \u201ccarrying out a criminal investigation into how a supplier was allegedly providing products labelled as British when they were in fact sourced from elsewhere.\u201dDavies said the investigation was \u201ccomplex\u201d and that \u201call new lines of inquiry \u2026 including any potential food hygiene breaches at the premises\u201d were being pursued. \u201cIf any evidence of a food safety risk is found, then necessary action will be taken,\u201d he said.Last year, Davies said, the FSA \u201cadvised retailers \u2026 to check their cooked meat supply chain and to apply extra due diligence in their checks. We don\u2019t give out these alerts without a reason.\u201dDavies said the cost of living crisis could mean that food fraud increased as suppliers face pressure to turn a profit.\nThis article was amended on 30 March 2023 and 31 March 2023. An earlier version said that Robert Goodwill was Defra minister of state; in fact he is chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee. The original piece implied that the inspectors were from the FSA, but in fact inspections would be carried out by local authorities and the industry\u2019s own auditors. It was further amended to reflect that Goodwill was asked about the possibility of a parliamentary inquiry, not a government inquiry.\n",

The group named the pigeon Flamingo, a nod to the brightly coloured wading birds found in wet habitats in the Caribbean, South America, Africa, the Middle East and Europe.\u201cFlamingo\u2019s story sparked a lot of emotion and generated interest from around the world,\u201d the Wild Bird Fund said. \u201cWe hope the tale of his too-short life will help prevent more acts of careless cruelty.\u201dPeople grew concerned about Flamingo\u2019s fate on Thursday when the Wild Bird Fund said the team had been unable to remove the pink dye.\u201cOne problem is that the dye has a very strong odor, and we\u2019re concerned for the bird\u2019s respiratory health,\u201d the group said in an Instagram post at the time. \u201cBirds are highly sensitive to certain fumes, and this pigeon is essentially living inside a cloud.\u201dFlamingo\u2019s treatment included heat, oxygen and subcutaneous fluids, and medication to counteract the toxin\u2019s effects, the Wild Bird Fund said. But he struggled to eat and digest food.\u201cThis king pigeon, a domestic bird likely raised for food, was malnourished, barely older than a baby and had no survival skills,\u201d said the Wild Bird Fund\u2019s announcement of Flamingo\u2019s death.\u201cDove releases sound romantic, but take away the decorations and Instagram photos, and they are the equivalent of dumping your helpless pets on the side of the road.

Another oil-producing country will simply make up for Colombia\u2019s shortfall.\u201d",

The survey found that together, the sites cover an area larger than India, including forests spanning twice the size of Germany.But experts say the world heritage sites are threatened by climate breakdown and human overconsumption, prompting warnings that some species could go extinct in the protected areas despite being recognised as globally important.The report authors say governments should think carefully about how better to protect the sites as they plan for meeting this decade\u2019s UN biodiversity targets, which are due before biodiversity Cop16 next year, as part of their efforts to protect 30% of Earth and restore degraded ecosystems.A male Javan rhinoceros calf in Ujung Kulon national park in Indonesia. Photograph: Enivonment and Forestry Ministry/AFP/Getty ImagesLazare Eloundou Assomo, director of world heritage at Unesco, said that while most world heritage sites were cultural, they also included many important natural areas that must urgently get better protection.\u201cThe main message is that we want governments to do more to protect these areas. World heritage sites are essential for the protection of biodiversity. We want them to do more by giving them the data to show that if they do not protect these areas, so many key species may go extinct. Vaquitas, the Javan rhinoceros, mountain gorillas: they are all in world heritage sites,\u201d he said.\u201cWe thought it was important to gather all the key scientific data and information concerning biodiversity at world heritage sites so people can see they are home to key species that could go extinct if the areas were not protected,\u201d he added.Other examples of unique biodiversity include Shark Bay in Australia, home to the largest seagrass plant on Earth, which stretches over 110 miles, and the 2,600-year-old Abuelo tree in Argentina.The survey found that Unesco sites also cover vital migration routes such as the east Atlantic flyway for birds that stretches from the Arctic to South Africa and the east Asian-Australasian flyway. Routes for elephants, sharks and saiga antelope are also included, along with the great migration of wildebeest on the plains of east Africa.To improve how sites are better protected, the report recommends that countries include Unesco sites in their national biodiversity strategies and action plans, which will detail how a country is contributing towards nature targets agreed at last December\u2019s Cop15 biodiversity conference.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

A plan to ban sales of new cars with combustion engines has been pushed back five years to 2035, a phase-out of gas boilers in homes has been scaled back and homeowners and landlords will no longer be required to meet energy efficiency targets in insulating homes.The British prime minister claimed the moves would save families money while still adhering to the net zero target but the international reaction to the decision has been scathing.\u201cThis action from Rishi Sunak is a disgusting betrayal of vulnerable people around the world, not to mention economic vandalism upon his own country,\u201d said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa.The UK has enjoyed a stellar reputation globally on its progress in cutting its own planet-heating emissions, which have fallen drastically as coal use has been virtually eliminated.The U-turn on climate policy has, therefore, caused surprise to ripple across delegates gathered in New York for a United Nations climate summit, held on Wednesday.

In July, employers across the country were ordered to limit outdoor work due to blistering heat.

In neighbouring Hebei province, things were even worse. From Saturday to Monday, one local weather station recorded 1,003mm of rain, almost twice the annual average.According to Chinese meteorologists, the rains were brought by the aftermath of Storm Doksuri, a former super typhoon, as it swept northwards over China after hitting Fujian province, in the south, last week.As the residual circulation of Doksuri\u2019s rain clouds blew north, a subtropical and continental high pressure system in the atmosphere also blocked their north and eastward passage, leading to a convergence of water vapour that acted like a dam storing the water.Then, as the clouds above northern China grew pregnant with millions of tonnes of water, they were lifted up by a low-altitude wind, pushing the rain east of the Taihang mountains, to where the worst-hit areas \u2013 including Beijing\u2019s Fangshan and Mentougou districts \u2013 are located.Passengers walk past cars submerged in flood water in the Mentougou district of Beijing on Monday.

Photograph: Courtesy of Tayyun Research StudioAfter 10 years working as an architect, a visit to a nature reserve in 2017 \u2013 and the guilt she felt about being part of the increasing urbanisation of the landscape \u2013 led Assaf to look for more meaningful work.She became involved in regenerative landscaping and native forest creation \u2013 often referred to as permaculture \u2013 after being inspired by a video by the permaculture consultant Geoff Lawton about a 2,000 year-old-forest in Morocco.The film shows a human-made forest in an arid landscape, with a high canopy of foliage, palm trees like sleek pillars and walls of fruit trees creating cool dark glades with mottled light filtering through. The forest floor was carpeted with shrubs and grass. She decided this was what she wanted to do in her native Jordan. Her research led her to the Miyawaki method from Japan, a way of planting saplings in a way that creates ultra-dense, multilayered native forests 10 times faster than it would regenerate naturally. The soil is analysed and improved, then four categories of native seedlings are planted: main tree species, sub-species, shrubs and ground-covering vegetation. The method has been adapted in several countries and has the potential to restore lost indigenous forests, a process that would normally take hundreds of years.\u201cMoving from architecture to urban rewilding and native forest creation simply felt like the right thing to do,\u201d says Assaf.Harvesting seeds as part of the rewilding in Jordan.

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, forests in Jordan cover only 975 sq km of Jordan\u2019s 89,000 sq-km area (34,000 sq miles) or barely 1% of the country.\u201cIt is not drought that causes bare ground \u2013 it is bare ground that causes drought,\u201d she says.The more we work on greening, the more we give nature the ability to restore itself, even in the driest places, she says. \u201cWorking with nature is a gentle yet firm call for patience, determination and faith to trust the process.\u201dA nursery for the Tayyun rewilding project.

She has gradually built a database of plants and trees for creating a native forest in Jordan. Today she organises workshops and offers opportunities for volunteers from all walks of life to join in with the planting of trees and harvesting seeds.\u201cWe are constantly testing techniques; always learning, refining, and fine-tuning,\u201d she says. So far, Tayyun has created four nascent forests, planting more than 2,700 native seedlings. The organisation also collects seeds for others, including those of Jordan\u2019s endangered species.Assaf is preparing her fifth forest with 1,100 native seedlings.

        "text": "Exports of Australian lithium \u2013 a key metal used in batteries \u2013 are expected to earn as much as sales of thermal coal within five years, as the world increasingly embraces clean energy and the market value of fossil fuels falls.New data released by the Australian government forecasts local lithium production will double and the industry\u2019s revenue will triple by 2027-28 compared with last financial year.The value of the country\u2019s thermal coal exports \u2013 burned in power plants in Asia to generate electricity \u2013 is headed in the other direction: expected to slump by more than 70% over the same timeframe as the price returns to pre-Covid levels.This is in part a reflection on how much fossil fuel prices have soared in recent years as a number of factors \u2013 the pandemic, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and flooding in some production areas \u2013 hit global supply. That has now started to come off. The price of thermal coal fell sharply over the first three months of this year, but the total value of thermal coal exports this financial year is still expected to reach $65bn.By 2027-28 it is expected to be at the same level as lithium \u2013 about $19bn. Like fossil fuels, lithium prices rose in the past year as demand outstripped supply. They are expected to reach nearly $19bn this year before falling as more mines start operating, then begin a gradual rise in the years ahead.Australian exports of lithium and thermal coal\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe rise of lithium is being significantly driven by the predicted tenfold growth in electric vehicle sales between now and 2030. Australia is the world\u2019s largest lithium exporter. It was responsible for more than half of global production last year.About 80% of the lithium dug up in Australia is used to make rechargeable batteries and this proportion is expected to reach 90% as EVs become popular. While Australia has been slower to embrace clean cars, global EV sales rose by more than 40% last year, largely due to surging interest in China.Tony Wood, the energy and climate change program director at the Grattan Institute thinktank, said the forecasts were plausible and Australia was well placed to capitalise on growing demand for lithium and other critical energy minerals, particularly nickel and cobalt.A Grattan Institute report from last year cited International Energy Agency forecasts that global demand for lithium would grow by up to 41 times by 2040, while the value of nickel and cobalt markets was expected to rise by a factor of 30.Australia has 27% of the world\u2019s known deposits of lithium, 22% of nickel and 21% of cobalt.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As a strategic pivot it makes a lot of sense,\u201d Wood said.Tim Buckley, the director of Clean Energy Finance, said public support for private investment in renewably powered refining operations should come from the $15bn national reconstruction fund and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, sometimes described as the government\u2019s \u201cgreen bank\u201d.\u201cThe massive opportunities emerging for Australia from the accelerating global energy transition are crystal clear,\u201d he said.Most of Australia\u2019s lithium production is in Western Australia, with mines operating in the state\u2019s north and south of Perth.The 2022 Grattan Institute report said regulation of new and expanding industries would be important.

        "text": "Imposing strict controls on car exhausts will only partially improve the quality of air people breathe in the UK, scientists have said. New measures to counter emissions of nitrogen oxides and other air pollutants will also be needed for buildings, heating plants and many other domestic and industrial sources in future.The warning follows the controversy that has surrounded London\u2019s ultra low emission zone (Ulez) in which drivers are charged for their vehicles\u2019 polluting impact. This month the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, will expand the zone from inner London so it covers all boroughs in the city. The decision has provoked opposition from some drivers and was blamed by various Labour party figures for the Conservatives surprise byelection win in Uxbridge and South Ruislip last month.But scientists at the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories at the University of York last week stressed the need to maintain air quality, particularly in cities. \u201cAir pollution is one of the highest causes of preventable death in the UK,\u201d Prof Alastair Lewis told the Observer last week.\u201cThe National Health Service is run at full stretch all the time, so every extra medical problem has a disproportionate effect. The crucial point is that it may be hard to make people eat healthy foods or not drink too much alcohol, but it is easy to make them breathe in clear air \u2013 as long as you provide it.\u201dIn London, there is very little difference between air quality in the inner city and in its outer boroughs \u2013 at present. Both have pollution levels that are far higher than those set as safe standards by the World Health Organization.However, the York team said they expected air quality to improve fairly rapidly in London\u2019s outer areas as the extension of the city\u2019s Ulez takes effect. But in the central area it will remain relatively high.Part of the problem lies with the greater congestion of the inner city. Vehicles emit more pollutants when braking and accelerating than they do when travelling at a steady speed. But there is another reason, one that has crucial implications for all urban areas.\u201cAbout half of all the nitrogen dioxide that pollutes central London actually comes from buildings and not from vehicles, and while we are taking measures to improve pollution from cars, buses and lorries, we are not yet tackling those produced by houses, offices and factories,\u201d said Lewis.The particular problem affecting buildings focuses on the way they are heated. Typical gas boilers and combined heat and power sources produce significant amounts of nitrogen oxides. \u201cThis latter issue \u2013 of space heating, as it is known \u2013 is going to become increasingly important in coming years,\u201d said LewisThis point was backed by his colleague Prof James Lee. \u201cThere will come a time when we will find that we cannot get air pollution levels to go down because we have done as much as we can by making improvements to pollution produced by road vehicles, but still have not tackled space heating and its impact on air quality. Then we will be at impasse \u2013 unless we act now.\u201dA measure of the problem is provided by examining how much nitrogen dioxide pollution is produced by a typical domestic gas boiler in a day. \u201cThe average output is the equivalent of driving a new diesel car for 70km,\u201d added Lewis. \u201cIt is a non-trivial amount.\u201dThe problem is made worse because many people think that pollution from boilers and other building heating systems will disappear should gas and oil be replaced by hydrogen as a key fuel for keeping our homes, offices and factories warm.\u201cPeople assume that burning hydrogen is a clean process that produces only water vapour, but that is not the case,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cThe heat of the flame you produce by burning hydrogen causes nitrogen molecules \u2013 the main constituent of air \u2013 to break apart and form nitrogen oxides, which are pollutants. It is an issue that planners and officials often miss, but it is important.\u201dThe crucial point is that if hydrogen is going to be used as a substitute for fossil fuels, as is planned, then plans need to be put in place immediately to ensure that machines that burn it are designed to limit the pollution they will produce.\u201cWe need to think about these issues today if we want to keep cutting air pollution in future,\u201d said Lee. \u201cWe need to reach net zero in the near future, but in a way that also keeps air pollution to a minimum.\u201d",

Yet governments everywhere display more determination in suppressing protest than combating warming. As Greta Thunberg notes, \u201cactivists all over the world are experiencing increased repressions just for fighting for our present and our future\u201d.NSW push to stop climate protesters livestreaming on Facebook labelled \u2018profoundly anti-democratic\u2019Read moreHere in Australia, the ALP\u2019s enthusiasm for the crackdown particularly sticks in the craw, given the willingness of Labor luminaries to associate themselves with important protests of the past.A few weeks ago, for instance, Melbourne Trades Hall rightly honoured Zelda D\u2019Aprano with a statue showing the women\u2019s liberation icon clutching the chains with which she fastened herself to a government building during a 1969 protest for equal pay. Former PM Julia Gillard hailed Zelda\u2019s determination \u2013 even though today Labor premiers have used \u201clock on\u201d stunts to justify jail terms for environmental activists.Minns\u2019 attempt to enlist Meta in his campaign against climate activism deserves particular scrutiny, not least because it\u2019s all too likely to succeed.Despite rightwing bleating about the supposed \u201cwoke\u201d bias of social media, studies show the opposite. As the researcher Paul Barrett explains, \u201cconservatives \u2026 gain the most in terms of engagement and online attention, thanks to the platforms\u2019 systems of algorithmic promotion of content\u201d. Indeed, Facebook has previously shown a willingness to ban leftwing accounts when they might embarrass the powerful.These days, Meta possesses a tremendous advantage, simply because it\u2019s not Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter. Recent reports suggest the company intends to exploit Musk\u2019s buffoonery with a new platform called Threads, offering what it calls a \u201csanely run Twitter\u201d.Yet \u201csanely run\u201d is a relative term, as Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg proved when he yesterday offered to fight Musk in a cage.The prospect of these two giant manbabies settling their commercial differences by rolling around on a jujitsu mat goes to the real problem with social media. The various platforms allow users to express themselves and, because of that, seem more participatory than old fashioned newspapers. Yet they\u2019re all owned by billionaires \u2013 and billionaires don\u2019t inhabit the same universe as normal people.That\u2019s the context to think about Australia\u2019s eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant\u2019s comments about hate speech on Twitter, a platform she correctly dubbed an \u201cabsolute bin fire\u201d.Noting the massive job cuts at Twitter, Inman Grant suggested the site no longer even enforced its own rules on toxic content. While that might be true, the real problems pertain less to those who have departed and more to those who have arrived \u2013 in particular, the new owner.This week Elon Musk declared that Twitter would treat the words cis and cisgender as \u201cslurs\u201d. The announcement came after he proclaimed that deadnaming or misgendering users would not be considered harassment. He also OKed an anti-trans documentary previously flagged as hate speech \u2013 and then personally shared the film with his own 144 million followers.At Twitter, the calls are, as they say, coming from inside the house.Back in 2018, when Musk described the future of transportation as tunnels with access via street-level stations, he was widely mocked for discovering the subway. Today, we might equally say that, with his $44bn acquisition of Twitter, he has reinvented the first Viscount Rothermere \u2013 the newspaper baron notorious for turning the Daily Mail into a mouthpiece for the 20th-century far right.In that respect, Musk and Zuckerberg have far more in common than either might care to think. Both are wealthy almost beyond imagination; both run their media empires according to arbitrary whims.That\u2019s why, when it comes to combating the far right online, we should be very careful about what we demand. Calls to ban \u201cextremism\u201d can all too easily provide a pretext for the kind of censorship that Minns seeks.More than anything, we should be calling for far greater transparency about how moderation decisions get made and by whom. As the planet continues to heat, politicians will go to greater and greater lengths to suppress popular outrage. The more we can force democratisation on media of all types, the better placed we\u2019ll be to fight both climate change and fascism.\nJeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist\n",

        "text": "News of the likely closure of the UK\u2019s steel blast furnaces has prompted calls for the government to reconsider approval for a controversial Cumbrian coalmine that had been planned to supply the industry.On Monday, British Steel announced that it plans to replace its two blast furnaces at Scunthorpe, while Tata Steel is considering closing its two at Port Talbot, in a dramatic reshaping of the UK steel industry. Both companies will instead rely on much cleaner electric arc furnaces, which use 87 times less coal.West Cumbria Mining plans to produce 2.8m tonnes of coking coal a year at Woodhouse colliery in Whitehaven for use by \u201csteelmakers in the UK and EU\u201d. However, the blast furnace closures would mean a dramatic reduction in coal use by the UK industry, and would probably mean that the vast majority of the Cumbrian coal would have to be exported.Tim Farron, the MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale in Cumbria and former leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the announcement from British Steel \u201cmeans that any economic case for a new coalmine in Cumbria is now completely dead in the water\u201d.He said: \u201cWe need to see the government wake up to the fact that the steel industry is now going full steam ahead to decarbonise steel and start to invest in long-term renewable jobs for the future.\u201dThe former Woodhouse colliery site where West Cumbria Mining have been given approval to once again extract coal. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty ImagesMichael Gove, the government minister in charge of planning, approved the UK\u2019s first new coalmine in 30 years last December, despite criticism from former Conservative ministers including Alok Sharma and Lord Deben.Electric arc furnaces require only 9kg of coking coal a tonne of steel against 780kg for a tonne of blast furnace steel, according to the lobby group UK Steel.British blast furnaces produced 4.8m tonnes of steel in 2022, suggesting they may have used 3.7m tonnes of coking coal. Based on UK Steel\u2019s figures, producing the same amount of steel in electric arc furnaces would require only 43,000 tonnes of coal, or about 1.7% of the Cumbrian mine\u2019s output.The UK government\u2019s decision notice last December approving the coalmine made reference to electric arc furnaces and other low-coal technologies, but said that there was \u201cno certainty that electric arc furnaces will make a significant contribution to UK steel production\u201d.Tony Bosworth, coal campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cMichael Gove\u2019s justification for approving the mine last December was largely that the steel industry would need coking coal for decades to come.\u201cBut it now seems the UK market will soon disappear.

Superdrug said it sold an average of 1,300 units of single-use vapes a week in stores and did not sell them online.The company said it had made the decision in order to protect the environment.Lucy Morton-Channon, its head of environment, social and governance, said: \u201cThe rate that consumers are using single-use vapes and discarding them is worrying and alarming for the environment.

This amounts to eight vapes a second being discarded, with the lithium in the products enough to create 5,000 electric car batteries a year.Superdrug also cited the risk of fires caused by improper disposal of vapes because many contain lithium batteries.Ministers are reportedly poised to ban single-use vapes amid concerns the devices are being marketed to children. Councils, paediatricians and environmental campaigners are among those who have called for the sale of disposable e-cigarettes to be outlawed.The government said it would soon publish a response to its call for evidence on vaping by young people, which closed in June.

But even if they do, onshore wind developers warn that the changes are unlikely to be sufficiently wide-ranging to kickstart significant new generation.A Downing Street spokesperson said on Monday: \u201cWe support the development of onshore wind where there is local support. Applications will continue to be decided at a local level.\u201dDevelopers say the changes would still leave an effective ban in place, while Labour\u2019s Ed Miliband promised to give onshore wind parity with other infrastructure projects.Under the current system, a local authority in England can reject an application to build an onshore windfarm on the basis of a single objection from a local resident. Any new development must also have been included in the authority\u2019s most recent local development plan, a document that covers several years\u2019 worth of building schemes.These requirements, which are not applied to other energy sources, were put in place in 2015 by David Cameron under pressure from many of his own MPs, who did not support the widespread development of onshore wind.Collectively, they have contributed to new onshore wind development almost stalling, leading critics to call them a \u201cde facto ban\u201d. Only 20 onshore wind turbines have received planning permission since 2015 \u2013 just 2.7% of the number granted permission between 2009-14, before the restrictions were put in place.No 10 decided to act last year after 34 Tory MPs, including the former prime ministers Liz Truss and Boris Johnson, signed an amendment in support of more onshore wind.In response, the government published a consultation on changing the rules, which suggested that developments could be approved as long as local authorities could show they had consulted local residents, rather than having had to address every single concern.Ministers are due to publish their response to that consultation this week, with rebels threatening to introduce an amendment to the energy bill if their concerns are not met. One told the Guardian on Monday, just a day before the bill was due to return to the Commons, that they remained locked in negotiations with ministers.Some, however, say that even if the government accepts all the demands of its own MPs, it will still not be enough to unlock the country\u2019s onshore wind potential \u2013 in part because the rebels have proposed eliminating developers\u2019 right of appeal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A further 52,000 deaths came from excessive levels of nitrogen dioxide and 22,000 deaths from short-term exposure to excessive levels of ozone.\u201cThe figures released today by the EEA remind us that air pollution is still the number one environmental health problem in the EU,\u201d said Virginijus Sinkevi\u010dius, the EU\u2019s environment commissioner.Doctors say air pollution is one of the biggest killers in the world but death tolls will drop quickly if countries clean up their economies. Between 2005 and 2021, the number of deaths from PM2.5 in the EU fell 41%, and the EU aims to reach 55% by the end of the decade.Graph of deaths attributable to particulate air pollutionThe WHO, which tightened its air quality guidelines in 2021, warns that no level of air pollution can be considered safe but has set upper limits for certain pollutants. The European parliament voted in September to align the EU\u2019s air quality rules with the WHO\u2019s but decided to delay doing so until 2035.\u201cThe good news is that clean air policy works, and our air quality is improving,\u201d said Sinkevi\u010dius. \u201cBut we need to do better still, and bring pollution levels down further.\u201dFor the first time, the EEA estimated the full burden of disease from air pollution. As well as looking at the raw death tolls, the researchers worked out how many more years the population was living with diseases brought on by bad air.Graph showing burden of diseaseFor some health problems, such as lung cancer and ischaemic heart disease, the extra step changed little. But for others, such as asthma, it revealed high levels of suffering that had been overlooked in mortality statistics.\u201cWhen people get lung cancer, normally they die very quickly,\u201d said Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez Ortiz, an EEA air pollution researcher. \u201cFor other diseases \u2013 especially asthma but also diabetes or also chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \u2013 there is also an important contribution of this state of living with disability.\u201dFor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease brought on by PM2.5 pollution in 2021, the EEA estimated about 150,000 years of life have been lost across the EU and about the same number of years of disability.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Climate scientists on carbon offsettingRead moreCarbon credits are awarded to projects such as conserving rainforests from logging, preserving natural carbon sinks or reducing greenhouse gas emissions in other ways, such as funding wind or solar farms. They are frequently sold to companies who use them to cancel the impact of their emissions and claim carbon neutrality.The Guardian found numerous problems in the market, including offsets that carried little or no environmental benefit, and people who said they had their homes torn down to make way for projects. Projects that aim to conserve areas of forest often claim that the trees would be prey to loggers without their protection, but this is hard to prove.However, many climate experts have also said that carbon markets are needed. There are few ways of generating the cash needed to reduce emissions and preserve the world\u2019s remaining carbon sinks, and governments are unlikely to provide the hundreds of billions of dollars needed to do so.Selling carbon credits could provide an income stream for local people and an incentive to keep forests standing rather than logging them or using them for agriculture or plantations.Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, has championed carbon markets. He told the Cop15 biodiversity conference in December: \u201cWe must rapidly progress efforts to bring both high integrity and high volume to voluntary carbon markets so that carbon credits can fulfil their potential of reducing emissions and supporting biodiversity, mitigation and adaptation objectives \u2026 The carbon market could deliver huge co-benefits for the planet, Indigenous peoples and local economies.\u201dNazareth said the new, more stringent standards that should come later this year would provide reassurances to buyers. \u201cOnce we have issued high-integrity labels, we will oversee the market,\u201d she promised. \u201cWe will conduct spot checks to ensure credits with high-integrity labels meet the criteria, monitor concerns and complaints, and engage with programmes to understand how they are dealing with these issues.

The forecast for the following week was awful \u2013 for storms, clouds, rain and \u201cunseasonably cold\u201d weather. In other words, another typical August.In the event the forecast was wildly inaccurate. Where I was on the Welsh coast, just one day passed without sun for all or part of the day. It did rain heavily for part of one day and there was the odd shower. It certainly was not hot. But a week on the beach was feasible, the sea blue and the sunsets glorious.

One publican told me he can predict his takings each day not by the weather but by the 8am forecast. Yet it is so often wrong. The weather forecast is England\u2019s economic sanction against Wales.That August can be changeable is no surprise, but why do we still have our holidays then? Statistically, July is Britain\u2019s hottest month, and June is the sunniest. August is more like May but without the blossoms of spring. Most other countries in the northern hemisphere tend to break in mid-July, which is also when the majority of Americans begin their summer.

It was the month when the Industrial Revolution allowed thousands of factory workers to return to their former rural homes to help gather in the crops. The custom continued in London into the 20th century, with East Enders abandoning the gasworks \u2013 less needed in summer \u2013 and returning to harvest the hops in Kent. August was also the start of the grouse shooting season \u2013 not because of the weather but because of the production cycle of a bird.However you slice it, August is simply a bad month for a holiday. By mid-August nights are getting longer and chillier, and the weather ever less predictable. It must make sense to switch to taking leave from mid-June to mid-July. Workers and pupils would get into the open air when it is warmest. Tourist overcrowding would spread and reduce the load on Mediterranean resorts. Working from home is already diversifying work practices. The answer may be to take July off and work partly from home through much of August.Like decimalisation, such a reform of custom and practice requires simply a government with the guts to do it. We know July holidays would make sense for almost everyone.

        "text": "After months of extreme weather that tore through New Zealand\u2019s road, power and communications networks, the government has pledged a large, rapid funding boost to adapt infrastructure for the climate crisis, including an expansion of the nationwide network of electric vehicle charging stations.The NZ$6bn announced in Thursday\u2019s budget for a national resilience plan will initially be spent on clean-up and recovery from record-breaking floods that swamped Auckland in January and Cyclone Gabrielle, which in February devastated parts of the North Island. But finance minister Grant Robertson promised in remarks at parliament on Thursday that attention would then turn to increasing the \u201cresilience\u201d of New Zealand\u2019s infrastructure to cope with increasing climate-related weather disasters.New Zealand budget 2023: Chris Hipkins focuses on young families suffering in cost of living crisisRead moreThe funding includes $300m for \u201csignificant upgrades\u201d to roads for slip prevention, flood mitigation, and managing the risk of rising seas, said Michael Wood, the transport minister, in a statement.\u201cIt was unacceptable that basic lifeline services like telecommunications, power and transport links were knocked out for so long,\u201d Robertson added, referring to the recent cyclone and storms.With damage from the twin disasters expected to cost billions, Robertson had warned that this year\u2019s budget would be a no frills document, prompting questions about how the Labour government would balance the cost of weather clean-up and recovery with years of promised commitments to curbing greenhouse gas emissions.Megan Woods, the energy and resources minister, said in a statement on Thursday that the government\u2019s investments would do both, making the transport network \u201cmore resilient to weather events, and climate friendly\u201d.Measures to address emissions included $120m over four years to expand the country\u2019s electric vehicle charging network, Woods said, with a focus on rural areas. A partnership with the private sector will produce up to 23 hubs, each supplying up to 20 EV chargers.A grant was announced for purchases of low emissions heavy vehicles such as trucks and buses to incentivise change to a national vehicle fleet that\u2019s among the world\u2019s oldest and dirtiest.Funds were also pledged for adaptation in remote communities, such as Westport in the South Island, that are most threatened by floods, storms and sea level rises.The $6bn for a national resilience plan would, during its first two years, \u201cfocus on cyclone rebuild and recovery\u201d, Robertson told reporters on Thursday. Improving the \u201cresilience\u201d of infrastructure in the long-term would follow, he added.This year\u2019s weather disasters drew fresh attention to the country\u2019s ailing infrastructure. New Zealand\u2019s crumbling state highways in its remote regions \u2013 including some hardest hit by Cyclone Gabrielle \u2013 are the result of decades of inefficiencies and under-investment in infrastructure, successive reports and Treasury figures have said.The new national resilience plan would \u201creduce the severe infrastructure deficits that have held New Zealand back\u201d, Robertson said.The funding committed in this year\u2019s budget amounted to \u201cmore than business as usual\u201d, the finance minister said, and would be paid for through \u201cmaking greater use of the government\u2019s balance sheet\u201d. Labour had already committed to $71bn for infrastructure over the next five years, he added.",

Almost 300 homes were without electricity and numerous roads were closed because of the risk of landslides, rockfalls and subsidence.Meteorologists warned residents along the Rh\u00f4ne at Lyon and from Avignon to Marseille that there was a risk of flooding as sections of the river were expected to rise by about a metre.The deluge hit northern France particularly hard, coming after two storms, Ciar\u00e1n and Domingos, struck the region in quick succession, saturating the ground.

        "text": "Downing Street is facing calls to explain why it has appointed a wealthy, unelected shooting enthusiast as its animal welfare minister after it emerged he has backed the culling of seals and wild birds.Robbie Douglas-Miller, who was last week given a peerage to allow him to become minister in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), owns a grouse moor in Scotland and has argued for the relaxation of rules on shooting wild birds that prey on salmon.He is also on the board of a fishery which applied to obtain a licence to kill seals in 2021; last year he gained a licence to kill wild cormorants and sawbill ducks.In 2016, Douglas-Miller complained about the impact of seals and birds on salmon stock. The peer said in a letter to supporters of the Atlantic Salmon Trust, which he chaired: \u201cDifficulties do remain with a lack of understanding of the impact of predation by increasing numbers of fish-eating birds and a burgeoning seal population \u2013 all enjoying protection by law.\u201dExperts disagree that shooting seals protects salmon. Hugo Tagholm, executive director of Oceana UK, said overfishing, salmon farming and poor water quality are drivers of salmon decline, not seals which evolved alongside salmon: \u201cIt is these issues we should be focused on, not shooting our seals. The UK can be proud of the fact that it is home to internationally important populations of seals. But they need our protection: since they are slow to reproduce and vulnerable to the climate crisis and disease, any increase in adult mortality can quickly affect a population, destroying a keystone species of our rich marine wildlife.\u201dDouglas-Miller was made a baron on Friday in a surprise appointment as an environment minister and given the portfolio responsibility for animal welfare this week.In September, he signed a letter with fellow grouse moor owners lobbying the Scottish government to water down new laws that bring in licences for grouse-shooting in an effort to address persecution of birds of prey.Scotland is a stronghold for the grey seal and thousands of tourists travel to see them and their fuzzy, white young. With big eyes and long whiskers, they are one of the rarest species of seal and about 50% of the world\u2019s population lives in British and Irish waters. Dr Ruth Tingay, a bird expert who runs the Raptor Persecution blog, said: \u201cThis appointment is both surprising and concerning in equal measures. I\u2019m also deeply suspicious of the timing of it.A baby grey seal. Scotland is home to more than a third of the world\u2019s population of grey seals.  Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA\u201cWe\u2019ve already got one wealthy, unelected grouse moor-owning Defra minister in Lord Benyon, why do we need another one and why has this appointment been made now when the government is hurtling towards certain defeat in an imminent general election?\u201dDouglas-Miller owns over 4,000 acres in Scotland and is relatively unknown in the environment sector.His family once ran the famous Jenners department store known as the Harrods of the North, which was frequented by the Queen and held a Royal Warrant.The minister is also connected with King Charles. The monarch was a patron of the Atlantic Salmon Trust and Alister Jack, the Scotland secretary, sat on the board.There now appears to be a trend of unelected, grousemoor owning Lords being given positions at Defra. Lord Benyon has for years been a Defra minister. He owns vast swathes of land and last year was subject to protests for restricting parts of his estate from ramblers. Douglas-Miller has also been criticised by ramblers for obstructing access to his estate.Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: \u201cThis appears to be a wholly inappropriate appointment, which is something we\u2019ve come to expect from Rishi Sunak. An unelected wealthy landowner who has restricted public access to nature, and supported shooting at protected birds, is not someone I\u2019d trust to prioritise animal protection, improve nature access and urgently restore our natural environment.\u201cThere are many questions to be answered. What will his responsibilities within the department be, and why do we still not know a whole four days after his appointment? Did the government consider his potential conflicts of interest before giving him the job? And why, when Rishi Sunak has 349 other MPs to choose for the job, does he opt for an unelected landowner?\u201dDaisy Cooper MP, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 deputy leader, said: \u201cWhat an embarrassing mess. How is a gun going to save fish from drowning in sewage?\u201cThis Conservative government cannot be trusted to keep animals safe. They have failed spectacularly on the environment and the public are fed up of it.\u201dA Defra spokesperson said: \u201cThe minister is fully committed to the government\u2019s world-leading reforms on animal welfare, conservation and nature recovery.\u201d",

        "text": "A report that hugely overestimated the cost to the UK of reaching net zero emissions has been retracted by the rightwing thinktank that published it.The Civitas pamphlet published on Thursday claimed to offer a \u201crealistic\u201d estimate of the cost \u2013 \u00a34.5tn \u2013 and said \u201cthe government needs to be honest with the British people\u201d. However, factual errors were quickly pointed out after publication.The most serious error was the confusion by the report\u2019s author, Ewen Stewart, between power capacity in megawatts (MW) with electricity generation in megawatt hours (MWh). As a result, he presented an unrealistic \u201c\u00a31.3m per MWh\u201d figure for the cost for onshore wind power. The true number is more than 10,000 times lower at about \u00a350 to \u00a370 per MWh. Another error was mixing up billions with trillions.A statement on the Civitas website said: \u201cThis report has been taken down from the website because it was found to contain factual errors, it is undergoing revision and a fresh process of peer review. A revised report will be released when this process is completed.\u201dHow a thinktank got the cost of net zero for the UK wildly wrong Read moreThis statement replaced an earlier one in which Civitas said the report\u2019s problems were limited to only two paragraphs: \u201cThere has been criticism on social media of two paragraphs of this report, where capacity and output are confused. These paragraphs will be amended and updated. The author is happy to acknowledge this and correct the report. The fact remains that we are facing a huge bill for net zero that is many times more than official estimates.\u201dThe erroneous Civitas estimate of the cost of meeting net zero is far higher than the figure produced by the government\u2019s official adviser, the climate change committee (CCC), which said that reaching net zero would require net investments of \u00a31.4tn by 2050.However, the CCC also found that reaching net zero would generate savings in the form of lower fossil fuel bills worth \u00a31.1tn, resulting in a net cost of \u00a30.3tn. The Civitas report did not reference the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s 2021 conclusion that \u201cunmitigated climate change would ultimately have catastrophic economic and fiscal consequences\u201d. Stewart wrote in 2021 that human-caused warming is a \u201ccontested theory\u201d.The report followed Rishi Sunak\u2019s recent climate speech, in which he called for an \u201chonest\u201d approach to net zero that ends \u201cunacceptable costs\u201d and changed policies in order to slow the pace of the UK\u2019s climate action. The Civitas report was covered by the Sun, the Times, Daily Mail, Daily Express and the Spectator. By Monday the Express had removed its article, while others had added footnotes but kept the pieces online.Prof Jim Skea, the new chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world\u2019s foremost climate science body, said on Monday that taking a slower route to net zero emissions by 2050 will worsen the climate crisis.Analysis of the Civitas report by Carbon Brief\u2019s Simon Evans in the Guardian on Friday found statements unsupported by evidence and cherrypicked statistics. The report stated, for example, that it is \u201cnot unreasonable to assume\u201d that net zero would add \u00a3403bn to the cost of food, but did not say how that would happen. Published evidence indicates instead that the impacts of climate change and high fossil fuel prices have added an estimated \u00a311bn to UK food bills in 2022 alone.The report also cited a 2019 report from the Faraday Institute to claim that net zero could result in 114,000 job losses in the car industry, but ignored the same report\u2019s finding that a well-marshalled shift to electric vehicles could support 246,000 jobs in the sector.",

        "text": "There will be many reasons why Britain\u2019s energy secretary, Claire Coutinho, went public with her unease about \u201cserious and concerning\u201d allegations raised by the Guardian this week over cybersecurity, site safety and a \u201ctoxic\u201d workplace culture in Sellafield. There was the \u201clongstanding nature\u201d of the matters in question, raising questions over the site\u2019s management. Neighbouring governments have had serious concerns. The plant holds enough plutonium to potentially make thousands of atomic bombs of the size that obliterated Japan\u2019s Nagasaki in 1945. By asking for assurances from its state-controlled owner and its regulator, Ms\u00a0Coutinho emphasises that effective governance of\u00a0Britain\u2019s nuclear industry is a critical issue.This is a sensible response to these scandals. The cabinet minister is right to publicise her concerns about a hazardous industry that can inflict catastrophic environmental damage and deaths. She has sent a helpful signal about valuing public safety over secrecy. Sellafield in Cumbria, and about 20 smaller sites, need to be monitored and protected, as the waste stored can remain radioactive for tens of thousands of years. Yet the nuclear establishment is at best opaque. Britain\u2019s postwar development of nuclear weapons grew alongside the construction of nuclear energy reactors. The industry\u2019s military connections have influenced its approaches to corporate governance for the worse.There is an urgent problem of nuclear waste disposal. Britain was one of the first economies to generate nuclear energy. But that meant radioactive waste has been left for decades without a permanent storage solution. This has seen the cost of temporary storage soar and the risk of catastrophe increase. Sellafield is one of the most dangerous places in the world, a notoriety bolstered by crumbling buildings and tanks leaking irradiated sludge. It is no stranger to trouble, going as far as changing its name to distance itself from being the site of one of history\u2019s worst nuclear accidents in 1957.The consensus today for an enduring answer is to bury nuclear waste deep underground in \u201cgeological disposal facilities\u201d. Finland will open one next year. Its spent nuclear fuel will be packed in copper canisters, and these entombed in the bedrock on the Gulf of Bothnia at a depth of 400m. France and Sweden are pursuing similar schemes. Britain has homed in on three sites, but finding an area willing to host a \u00a353bn underground dump is not easy, given public safety concerns.It would be better to have cheap, green energy that doesn\u2019t create toxic waste. But demand for electricity is growing, and \u2013 without the battery technology to effectively store energy \u2013 this will have to be met at times when there is no sun or wind. Hence countries aim to use nuclear energy to try to cut fossil fuel dependence. But, say experts, ambitious government targets for more nuclear power stations could see Britain run out of room to store the radioactive waste produced. Opportunities arise too. Half of the world\u2019s 420 nuclear reactors will need dismantling by 2050. Sellafield is at the heart of a billion-pound UK decommissioning industry. Its expertise could be sold worldwide. But that relies on a reputation for safety and competence, something that Ms Coutinho\u2019s intervention doubtless seeks to salvage.\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

More than half \u2013 55% \u2013 of the country\u2019s total river length showed \u201cmoderate or severe impairment\u201d from organic pollution or nutrient enrichment \u2013 typically caused by effluent and runoff from farming, and 45% of rivers were unswimmable, due to campylobacter infection risk.\u2018Like you\u2019re in a horror movie\u2019: pollution leaves New Zealand wetlands irreversibly damagedRead moreThe report \u201cunflinchingly identifies the appalling state of lowland freshwaters of Aotearoa,\u201d Mike Joy, a senior freshwater and governance researcher at Victoria University of Wellington, said. Prof Jenny Webster-Brown, president of the Freshwater Sciences Society, called it \u201cdismal\u201d. The report \u201cshould be able to galvanise the stewards of our environment into action,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know what needs to be done to reverse these trends.\u201dSewage overflows emptied into freshwater systems at a rate of more than 11 a day. Wastewater service providers reported more than 4,200 overflows due to wet weather events, or blockages and failures during dry weather between July 2020 and June 2021. \u201cPeople\u2019s health is put at risk by pollution from sources such as wastewater overflows and livestock runoff,\u201d the report concluded.Dr Tim Chambers, a senior public health research fellow at the University of Otago, said the results were \u201csobering\u201d.Behind many of the results lies New Zealand\u2019s rapid intensification of dairy farming, to feed its export markets. The dairy industry now forms a significant chunk of New Zealand\u2019s economy, accounting for about 3% of GDP and 20% of total exports in 2020 \u2013 around $17bn of export revenue each year. \u201cAotearoa has experienced one of the highest rates of agricultural land intensification over recent decades internationally,\u201d Chambers said, with dairy cow numbers almost doubling nationally from 3.4m in 1990 to 6.3m in 2019 \u2013 with some South Island regions \u201cseeing 10-fold and 16-fold increases during this same period\u201d.The enormous expansion of dairying land has required extensive irrigation and fertiliser use, particularly in the dry, windy plains of the South Island. Over the same decade, irrigated land has doubled, with about 75% of this increase attributable to dairy intensification. That combination: irrigation pulled from the rivers and nitrogen or phosphate-based fertilisers washing back downstream has had a substantial impact on rivers, wetlands and lakes.While there have been significant efforts under way by farmers to reduce runoff, the overall growth of farms has been offsetting many of those gains. The report concluded that while efforts to \u201creduce fertiliser use and keep stock out of waterways helped to reduce the amount of phosphorus and sediment reaching our rivers \u2026 because the number of farms grew, it\u2019s estimated the total amount of nitrogen reaching rivers increased.\u201dNew Zealand\u2019s Labour government has made a number of commitments to return the country\u2019s rivers to health since it was elected in 2017 \u2013 but those efforts appear to bearing limited fruit, with more waterways in decline than improving. Between 2001 and 2020, 56% of rivers were getting worse, and 25% were improving, the report found. For lakes, the report looked at the decade to 2020 - when 45% got worse and 36% improved.Most New Zealand communities are based around waterways, where they are a source of food, recreation and beauty \u2013 and their degradation is altering the way New Zealanders live, as bodies of water become poisoned and inaccessible. Those effects are particularly pronounced for M\u0101ori, who maintain intimate relationships to waterways, regarding them as ancestral connections.The degradation of waterways was also heavily affecting bird and fish populations that depend on freshwater for food and habitats. About two-thirds of freshwater native bird and fish species were either threatened with extinction or at risk of becoming threatened, the report found.Natasha Lewis, deputy secretary for joint evidence, data and insights at the ministry for the environment, which produced the report, said the impact of damage to waterways was already significant: \u201cWhen they\u2019re degraded, it affects ecosystems, communities, people\u2019s lives, and things that are important to New Zealanders from all walks of life,\u201d she said.",

        "text": "Disposable vapes are increasingly causing fires in bin lorries and recycling issues at a \u201cgreat cost\u201d to the taxpayer, councils have said.The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, said single-use vapes such as Elf bars, Lost Mary and Juul were almost impossible to recycle. They are designed as one unit so batteries cannot be separated from the plastic.The organisation said the lithium batteries inside the plastic can sharply increase in temperature if crushed and can become flammable. This costs taxpayers money through fire damage to equipment and the specialist treatment needed to deal with hazardous waste.Last year, research by Material Focus \u2013 a non-profit organisation which runs the Recycle Your Electricals campaign \u2013 found that about 1.3m single-use vapes are thrown away each week in the UK \u2013 an extraordinary rise since the first was sold in 2019. Their work found that more than 700 fires in bin lorries and recycling centres were caused by batteries that had been dumped into general waste.Last month, recycling firms said they were dealing with so many vapes that they were struggling to insure their facilities. Some are using artificial intelligence to detect vapes, as well as installing thermal imaging cameras and automatic foam jets.The warning comes days after children\u2019s doctors called for an outright ban on disposable vapes to reduce their popularity among young people as the long-term impact remains unknown.Dr Mike McKean, the RCPH vice-president and a paediatric respiratory consultant, said the college had made a \u201cvery carefully considered call\u201d, amid concern from its members about an \u201cepidemic\u201d of child vaping. It was noted that a small but growing number of children were experiencing respiratory problems.The children\u2019s commissioner for England, Rachel de Souza, urged ministers to crack down on the \u201cinsidious\u201d marketing of vapes to young people. She said the government would be \u201cfailing a generation\u201d if these \u201chighly addictive and sometimes dangerous products\u201d were allowed to become mainstream.While the LGA did not go as far as calling for a ban on disposable vapes, it said retailers and producers of these products should take responsibility for the litter they create.Councillor Linda Taylor, the LGA\u2019s environment spokesperson, said: \u201cSingle-use vapes, just like any other item of hazardous waste, need to be properly classified and producers must take responsibility for the litter they create.\u201cThe volume of these items that council waste teams are handling is increasing, and this is coming at a great cost to the council taxpayer.\u201cWe need a crackdown on the producers and retailers of these products, and to get this litter under control.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

        "text": "The European Commission is being sued by environmental campaigners over a decision to include gas and nuclear in an EU guide to \u201cgreen\u201d investments.Two separate legal challenges are being lodged on Tuesday at the European Union\u2019s general court in Luxembourg \u2013 one by Greenpeace and another by a coalition including Client Earth and WWF \u2013 after the classification of fuels in the so-called taxonomy, a guide for investors intended to channel billions into green technologies.The EU executive, argues Greenpeace, acted unlawfully when it designated gas and nuclear as bridge technologies in the taxonomy, which is intended to help meet the bloc\u2019s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Client Earth, along with three other NGOs, is challenging the inclusion of gas, which it says breaks the EU climate law that sets a legally binding target of reaching net zero emissions by the middle of the century.The cases are the latest legal action against the EU\u2019s \u201ctaxonomy for environmentally sustainable economic activities\u201d. Last year a lawsuit was launched by Austria and supported by Luxembourg.Eight national and regional Greenpeace organisations including France, Germany and EU office in Brussels are asking the court to rule the inclusion of gas and nuclear invalid.Nina Treu, the executive director of Greenpeace Germany, said: \u201cThe taxonomy was meant to be a tool to meet the 1.5C target [on global heating] and make the European Union climate neutral, fostering social and economic restructuring for the European economy by shifting funds. Instead of hindering greenwashing, it has become a tool for greenwashing.\u201dGas and nuclear had been included because of \u201cpolitically motivated lobbying\u201d, Treu said. Greenpeace will tell the court that gas cannot be considered a \u201ctransition fuel\u201d because any gas-powered plant that comes online today will still be running beyond 2050.The environment group will also say the construction of new nuclear plants \u2013 which usually take one to two decades to build in Europe \u2013 will delay the move away from coal power, hinder development of renewables, risk accidents and create pollution. \u201cNuclear is dangerous, expensive, vulnerable to climate change and too slow to stop the climate breakdown,\u201d Treu said.Greenpeace has hired the lawyer Roda Verheyen, who acted for the group in a landmark case that resulted in Germany\u2019s climate protection laws being ruled inadequate by the country\u2019s constitutional court in 2021.Verheyen said the inclusion of gas and nuclear was not in line with the EU\u2019s original taxonomy law. \u201cThe European Commission has violated the very idea of the taxonomy regulation. This is especially obvious as including nuclear activities does pose significant harm to the environment, which is expressly prohibited by the regulation.\u201dThe lawsuit was \u201cessentially an enforcement claim\u201d, she said. \u201cObserve your own law. Actually carry through with the European green deal,\u201d she said, referring to the EU\u2019s flagship climate plan.The EU taxonomy became law in July 2020, but legislators left important details to be resolved through so-called delegated acts \u2013 secondary legislation meant for technical issues that is not subject to the same degree of ministerial and parliamentary oversight.The campaign groups are challenging one of the delegated acts.The separate legal challenge by the coalition including Client Earth and WWF covers the inclusion of gas but not nuclear. Ana\u00efs Berthier at Client Earth said the European Commission had violated a requirement to make science-based policy and broken the EU climate law that required policymakers to carry out checks to ensure all actions by the bloc were consistent with the goal of achieving net zero by 2050.\u201cLabelling fossil gas as \u2018sustainable\u2019 is as absurd as it is unlawful,\u201d said the coalition, which also includes the NGOs Transport & Environment and Bund. \u201cIt goes against the EU\u2019s own scientific advice and fundamentally undermines the credibility of the EU\u2019s climate action. Fossil gas is not clean, not cheap and not a secure source of energy.\u201dA judgment is expected in 2025, although participants expressed the hope the court would act faster. \u201cThere is confusion in the market, because the current law infringes European law,\u201d Verheyen said.",

We are at least 20 if not 30 years behind in regard to the science and the ethics.\u201dOogjes said the government was playing catch-up with retailers and most farmers who have already begun to voluntarily phase out the use of laying cages. She said regulators had an obligation to bring forward the 2036 deadline and bring the standards in line with market demand.\u201cBy 2025, only two years away now, each of the major supermarkets will not be selling any caged eggs at all,\u201d she said. \u201cThe trend is absolutely under way.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\n\u201cIt\u2019s so sad that the law is behind the community\u2019s view \u2013 and indeed the supermarkets\u2019 view \u2013 that cages have to go.\u201dThe 2036 phase-out was announced in August and was criticised at the time as too lax by animal welfare groups and too strict by farmers.Oogjes said the criticism was only coming from a small number of farmers ho had invested in \u201coutdated\u201d infrastructure. She said the main barrier was balancing the various political interests of state governments, some of which held back the reforms.Jed Goodfellow from the Australian Alliance for Animals said he hoped that state agricultural ministers would negotiate a faster phase-out when they met in February.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit disappointing, we should be able to do it faster,\u201d Goodfellow said. \u201cAnd it really just comes down to Australia being a federated country, we\u2019ve got to get agreement from all states and territories. And, unfortunately, we\u2019ve seen the New South Wales government in particular, dragging the chain.\u201dNSW has the largest proportion of cage egg producers in the country, he said, and the state government has been \u201csensitive to the views of the egg industry\u201d in negotiating national reforms.But he stressed that the 14-year timeframe was only a recommendation at this stage and there was still time to alter any national agreement for the better.Goodfellow said arguments against banning battery cages were losing validity in the face of overwhelming public sentiment and retail demand for free range eggs.\u201cThe writing has been on the wall in terms of the phase-out of cages for many, many years,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the industry has had plenty of time to adjust, and now they\u2019re getting another 10 years.\u201dNew Zealand bans battery cages for hens \u2013 but replacement \u2018just as bad\u2019Read moreHe said with that kind of lead time, there was no room for the industry to mount an argument that it wasn\u2019t prepared for the change.\u201cWe see year on year at the supermarket level that when consumers can make the distinction between the caged egg and cage-free eggs, they\u2019re moving more and more towards the cage-free segment,\u201d Goodfellow said.The industry groups Egg Farmers Australia and Australian Eggs declined to comment on the New Zealand ban. In August Egg Farmers Australia said it was \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the new guidelines and that the phase-out should be pushed back to 2046.The federal agriculture department and NSW Department of Primary Industries did not respond before publication..\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community\n",

        "text": "Two small, oval fossils thought to be prehistoric plants are actually the remains of baby marine turtles, researchers have revealed.The fossils, found in rocks dating to between 132 and 113 million years ago, were discovered in Colombia in the middle of the 20th century by Padre Gustavo Huerta, a priest with a penchant for fossil plants.Initially it was thought the fossils represented a species of sphenophyllum \u2013 an extinct plant related to modern \u201chorsetails\u201d \u2013 with leaves split into wedge shapes and veins radiating from their bases. But experts now say that was a mistake.\u201cDuring the re-examination of the fossils, we attempted to find the veins of leaves. However, what we observed was a delicate layer of spongy bone tissue, leading us to rule out the possibility that these fossils were from plants,\u201d said Prof Edwin Cadena, a co-author of the study from the Universidad del Rosario in Bogot\u00e1.\u201cInstead, we began to compare them with fossils of vertebrates, and images of hatching turtles immediately came to our minds.\u201dWriting in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica, the team report how they compared the fossils with specimens of living marine turtles, as well as fossils of another species of sphenophyllum.The team say that revealed the oval fossils \u2013 which are 5cm and 6cm in length \u2013 are actually the hard shells, or carapaces, of marine turtles. What were originally thought to be the veins of leaves are actually bone growth patterns, they note, while there is also evidence of bones within the shell called neurals and costals, as well as highly serrated joints between them.The researchers say the turtles were probably less than a year old, and possibly of the species Desmatochelys padillai. This was a type of protostegid, a group of extinct marine turtles that include some of the largest ever to have lived.However, in a nod to the early misidentification the team have nicknamed them \u201cTurtwig\u201d, after a Pok\u00e9mon character that is half-turtle and half-plant.Dr Nick Fraser, an expert in vertebrate palaeontology at National Museums Scotland, who was not involved in the study, said the new interpretation made much more sense, as sphenophyllum existed in the Palaeozoic era, whereas the deposits the fossils were found in date from the later Mesozoic era \u2013 a disparity Cadena said was akin to erroneously suggesting dinosaurs lived at the same time as mammoths.Fraser added: \u201cIn some ways, the new interpretation is no less important and their identity as hatchling turtles looks spot-on to me. Such early stage turtles are rare in the fossil record and additional study, including CT analysis, could reveal valuable information that might allow species [identification].\u201dProf Andy Gale, a geologist and palaeontologist at the University of Portsmouth, said he was \u201cabsolutely sure\u201d the specimens were hatchling turtles rather than a plant. \u201cAn unusual misidentification, which shows that you sometimes see what you want to see even if it\u2019s not there,\u201d he said.",

They added that their findings also highlighted the need to better protect the environment and improve biodiversity in urban, suburban and rural areas in order to preserve bird habitats.The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, tracked 1,292 participants\u2019 everyday encounters with birds last year via a smartphone app called Urban Mind.Over the course of two weeks, the participants, from the UK, Europe, the US, China and Australia, were prompted at random intervals to record how they were feeling, including whether they were happy or stressed, whether they could see trees, and whether they could see or hear birds.Where all the birds have gone this year \u2013 a garden survey | LettersRead moreThe researchers found that participants\u2019 average mental wellbeing scores increased when they saw or heard birds, including among those who disclosed they had been diagnosed with depression.This beneficial effect also lasted beyond the moment of encountering birds, with higher levels of mental wellbeing noted by participants who did not see or hear birds the next time they recorded their mood.However, this positive effect did not persist if the participants did not encounter birds during the subsequent assessment of their mood, which the researchers said indicated \u201ca possible causal link effect of birdlife on mental wellbeing\u201d.Andrea Mechelli, professor of early intervention in mental health at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cWe need to create and support environments, particularly urban environments, where bird life is a constant feature.

        "text": "What are the advantages of pressure cookers?Charlie, LincolnWhat really sets pressure cookers apart from other bits of kitchen kit, notes food writer Catherine Phipps, is their versatility. \u201cI don\u2019t see them as a gadget, but just as a saucepan with a specially adapted lid,\u201d says the author of Modern Pressure Cooking. \u201cYou can use them for everything you would a normal saucepan, and much more besides, plus you\u2019re also cutting down 70-75% of the cooking time.\u201dStefano Arturi, of the Italian Home Cooking blog, adds: \u201cI can make dishes that would otherwise take hours [stews, chickpeas] in a fraction of the time, and with no loss of flavour \u2013 in fact, pressure cooking intensifies how things taste.\u201d And all for a fraction of the cost, too: \u201cIt\u2019s a great ally in reducing water and energy consumption when you\u2019re cooking things like vegetables, because you need very little of either.\u201dWhich pressure cooker you go for, however, depends on how you cook, how many you\u2019re feeding and what room you have available. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got very little counter space, get one you can leave on the hob,\u201d Phipps advises. \u201cYou can then use it as a saucepan, too.\u201d Electric pressure cookers, meanwhile, might suit those who \u201chave lots of worktop space, are used to slow- or multi-cookers and like that way of cooking\u201d; they also come with a multitude of accessories, such as air-fryer lids and yoghurt makers, if they\u2019re up your alley. That said, \u201cif you want to use it mainly as a pressure cooker, you\u2019d do much better to buy a stovetop model\u201d. In terms of size, bigger is often better, Phipps says, because it gives you more options; she has cooked as much as 500g dried beans in her four-and-a-half-litre pressure cooker and as little as 50g rice.You would also be wise to follow recipes designed specifically for pressure cookers, \u201cbecause it isn\u2019t obviously intuitive\u201d, Phipps says. \u201cYou\u2019ll soon get to a point where you can make educated guesses, though.\u201d For example, rice, pasta and pulses, which are cooked by absorption, are a game of ratios: Phipps uses 2:5 rice: liquid for risotto, while basmati requires equal parts rice and water. Brothy chickpeas, meanwhile, are a favourite of Arturi\u2019s: \u201cSoak dried chickpeas in cold water for 12 hours, then drain and transfer to the pressure cooker with fresh water until barely submerged.\u201d Add salt, olive oil and aromatics (garlic, bay, rosemary and/or a parmesan rind), then cook at high pressure for 10 minutes: \u201cWait for the pressure to drop naturally, then taste.\u201d If the chickpeas aren\u2019t quite soft, cook for a few more minutes more, then set aside, covered, for 30 minutes. \u201cSpoon them and a little of their golden broth over toast.\u201dPressure cookers are also useful for getting veg on the table quickly. In the case of sprout tops, kale and broccoli, for example, Phipps puts \u201ca slick of water in a pressure cooker\u201d, adds just-washed greens, brings up to pressure, then switches it off. \u201cFast release and it\u2019s done, often in seconds.\u201d There\u2019s no compromise on taste, either: \u201cI often cook broccoli at demos and people say: \u2018I\u2019ve never had such broccoli-tasting broccoli\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cPressure cookers are just so good at preserving flavour.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to FeastFree weekly newsletterRecipes from all our star cooks, seasonal eating ideas and restaurant reviews.

        "text": "The promises of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology date back almost 20 years. Yet today, no leading CCS facility is up and fully running in the UK.Until Rishi Sunak\u2019s announcement on Monday, there were two carbon capture projects in the UK, one in Merseyside and the other in Teesside and the Humber. Two further transport and storage projects, the Viking scheme in the Humber and the Acorn scheme in Aberdeenshire, have now been given government approval. The four CCS hubs are intended to collect CO2 from multiple sources and pipe it offshore to be stored in depleting North Sea gas fields.But, according to Stuart Haszeldine, professor of carbon capture and storage at the University of Edinburgh, announcing more CCS schemes at the same time as approving 100-plus new oil and gas drilling licences is like ordering a truckload of cigarettes for someone giving up smoking.Haszeldine said: \u201cThat\u2019s what yesterday\u2019s announcement was doing. CCS should be part of a package of things that you have to do \u2013 increasing renewables to switch our energy from burning gas and oil, doubling or even quadrupling the amount of electricity we have now, building in more efficiency in how we use our energy with insulation. It should be part of this package.\u201dGraphic showing how carbon capture and storage worksCCS involves capturing carbon dioxide from industrial facilities, such as chemical plants and oil refineries, then transporting and storing it.The UK\u2019s geology is suitable for storing carbon, and empty oilfields in the North Sea have been selected for storage. CCS is intended to be used in the transition to net zero to capture carbon from industries that will be harder to decarbonise, including cement, iron and steel, according to Haszeldine.He said: \u201cIn these industries, CCS can help and will be essential to get to net zero.\u201dA second nascent industry in capturing CO2 from the atmosphere is less developed than CCS linked to industrial facilities. The process of removing CO2 from the atmosphere is known as negative emissions.Jim Watson, professor of energy policy and director of the Institute for Sustainable Resources at University College London, said he understood the scepticism of some environmentalists about CCS because it could be viewed as \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card for oil and gas companies to continue getting fossil fuels out of the ground.Watson said: \u201cBut we do need it. If you look at independent assessments, including from the climate change committee, it is hard to see how to decarbonise the whole of industry without some carbon capture and storage.\u201dThe history of CCS in the UK is chequered. One of the first CCS strategies was in 2006, and there have been many false starts over the years.Even today, some projects already operating around the world have not been as successful as planned. In Australia, the CCS project run by Chevron has not yet made its Gorgon project meet its target of 80% carbon dioxide capture.A recent report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) on two Norwegian projects that store carbon dioxide under the seabed called into question the long-term viability of CCS.Its author, Grant Hauber, IEEFA\u2019s strategic energy finance adviser, said the Norwegian Sleipner and Sn\u00f8hvit CCS fields have been cited as global success stories, but because of the unpredictability of the subsurface conditions they cannot be used as definitive models for the future of the industry.Hauber said: \u201cEvery project site has unique geology. Subsurface conditions which exist at a given point on the Earth are specific to that place. Even then, any information obtained about that place is only a snapshot in time. The Earth moves and strata can change.\u201dThere is also a need to make sure the CO2 is stored in the ground permanently rather than allowing fossil fuel companies to use it to drill for more oil and gas elsewhere. This requires regulation and monitoring, said Watson.The timeframe for CCS is tight. The UK target is to raise the amount of CO2 captured from zero today to between 20m and 30m tonnes by 2030.Watson said: \u201cThere are still big questions about whether it can deliver the kind of numbers of storage that we need by this time.\u201d",

His mate is expected to arrive in April; they bred for the first time in 2022, becoming the first pair to do so after an absence of nearly 200 years.An adult osprey. Photograph: Mike Thornley/PAThe moment of celebration soon turned bittersweet as sinister, filmy slicks were blighting the surface of the natural harbour on Monday, with a major incident declared and a clean-up operation launched.The RSPB \u2013 which protects 250 hectares (630 acres) and six miles of coastline on Arne \u2013 has already identified birds covered in oil, including shelducks, Mediterranean gulls and black-headed gulls.On Shipstall Hill above the shoreline, Peter Robertson, senior sites manager at RSPB Arne, points to a passage of water between the privately owned Round Island and the peninsula where a slick was spotted earlier in the day, perilously close to the salt marshes that provides a habitat for thousands of wetland birds.\u201cWe have black-tailed godwits, avocets, curlews, spoonbills, they all occur in nationally important numbers,\u201d Robertson says just before a large flock of brant geese noisily glide past, landing on the tip of nearby Long Island.That an oil leak can occur near Arne confounds Robertson. Poole harbour, he explains, is one of the most heavily protected natural areas in the UK, with protections at UK, European and global level.\u201cOne of the most important wetlands in the world, with the highest level of protection, yet it is still at severe risk,\u201d he said.The spill could not have happened at a more critical time in the year for Arne and the wider harbour. As the seasons turn, the wetlands are uniquely home to winter birds yet to depart and summer birds recently arriving. \u201cWe\u2019re at peak traffic,\u201d Robertson says.The birds are not the only wildlife at risk. Poole harbour and its surrounding environs are a fragile, complex ecosystem.The marshes and mudflats are abundant with invertebrates and shellfish, a vital source of food for the birdlife, while the waters are full of fish, including bass, mackerel, tope \u2013 all sustenance for ospreys and the equally rare white-tailed eagles that soar above the harbour\u2019s waters.Egrets feeding in the mudflats at Arne in 2015.

The climate crisis is posing an existential threat to these colonies, as sea ice is rapidly melting.\u201cThis is an exciting discovery,\u201d said Dr Peter Fretwell, of the British Antarctic Survey, who led the research. \u201c[But] like many of the recently discovered sites, this colony is small and in a region badly affected by recent sea ice loss.\u201dPhoto issued by British Antarctic Survey of an emperor penguin colony that has been discovered in Antarctica using satellite mapping technology. Photograph: Maxar Technologies 2023/BAS/PAEmperor penguins are the only penguins that breed on sea ice, rather than land, and are located in areas that are very difficult to study because they are remote, inaccessible and can experience temperatures as low as \u221260C. For the last 15 years, British Antarctic Survey (BAS) scientists have been looking for new colonies by searching satellite imagery for tell-tale brown guano stains (penguin poo) on the ice.The latest colony, at Verleger Point, in west Antarctica, was discovered based on images from the European Commission\u2019s Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite mission, and confirmed on high resolution images from the Maxar WorldView-3 satellite.World faces \u2018terminal\u2019 loss of Arctic sea ice during summers, report warnsRead morePenguins need the ice to last between April and September to give the chicks time to grow more robust, making them particularly vulnerable to climate breakdown. \u201cIf the ice breaks up before that, the chicks fall into the water and drown or freeze,\u201d said Fretwell.The size of penguin colonies also has a direct impact on their survival as the birds huddle together for protection against winter storms, particularly during the two-month period in which the male penguins incubate the eggs before they hatch.Colonies have already been lost due to changes in sea ice, including one at Marguerite Bay that had been studied since the 1940s, and another in Halley Bay that had been stable for 50 years. \u201cMost emperor penguins will never see a human in their lifetime, but what we\u2019re doing on the other side of the world is slowly killing them,\u201d said Fretwell.Since 2015, there have been dramatic changes in sea ice in Antarctica, which have accelerated. \u201cLast year we had the worst ever sea ice conditions in Antarctica and this year is even worse,\u201d said Fretwell. \u201cWe\u2019re still working on what that means for the penguins, but it\u2019s not good.\u201dPrevious research has predicted that 90% of known colonies will be lost by the end of the century if no further action is taken to cut the greenhouse gas emissions. And Fretwell said that there was little that could be done to mitigate this impact besides curbing global warming. \u201cWe can try and protect the foraging areas for penguins by banning fishing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut truthfully this is a global problem and it can\u2019t be looked at on a local scale.\u201d",

        "text": "Hurricane Idalia, which has triggered evacuations as it threatens to pummel the northern reaches of Florida, is being fueled by unusually high temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, part of a trend of extreme marine heat that has dominated the summer.Idalia has churned across the Gulf of Mexico as a category 1 storm but is expected to strengthen to a category 3 event by the time it crunches into Florida\u2019s western coast on Wednesday, making it the first hurricane to hit the US this year.Hurricane Idalia closes in on Florida with warnings of 125mph windsRead moreThe rapid intensification of the hurricane, which is expected to bring strong winds, rain and a storm surge of up to 12ft as it travels across northern Florida, has been spurred by ocean temperatures that have remained persistently elevated throughout the summer.The eastern parts of the Gulf of Mexico have been around 87F (30.5C) to 89F (31C) in recent days, several degrees above the long-term average and part of a vast network of marine heatwaves that have covered nearly half of the world\u2019s oceans this summer. Scientists have said the extreme oceanic heat is consistent with the expected impacts of the climate crisis.The exceptional warmth of the Gulf extends down to about 165ft below the surface of the area where Idalia is traveling through, a rare occurrence described as \u201cother-worldly\u201d by Andy Hazelton, a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa).This level of ocean heat alone would be enough to make Idalia a devastating category 5 storm, scientists have said, although other factors such as wind shear will influence the ultimate outcome of the tempest. Hurricanes gather strength from warm oceans and moisture in the atmosphere, which are both facets of global heating.Studies have shown there is evidence that Atlantic hurricanes are becoming stronger and intensifying more rapidly due to these accelerants provided by the climate crisis. The current naturally occurring El Ni\u00f1o climate phenomenon, which has heated up the equatorial Pacific Ocean, is normally associated with a weaker hurricane season in the Atlantic, but Noaa recently warned of an above-average period of storms due, in part, to the extreme heat that has accumulated in the oceans.The oceans have absorbed about 90% of the extra heat due to the release of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, with the heightened temperatures causing stress to fish and bleaching and even death to coral reefs.Prof Michael Mann of the University of Pennsylvania told CNN: \u201cWe have bathtub-level warmth with these waters in the Caribbean and the tropical Atlantic \u2026 It\u2019s been the warmest year we have ever seen when it comes to Atlantic Ocean temperatures and global temperatures as well.\u201dIn July, the waters off southern Florida were measured to be at 101F (38F), a record temperature more often found in Jacuzzis than the ocean that raised fears for the state\u2019s ailing coral reef.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Over the weekend, both Houston and New Orleans recorded their hottest temperatures ever measured, reaching 109F (42C) and 105F (40.5C), respectively.Mann said the ocean temperatures were partly the natural transition to El Ni\u00f1o but added: \u201c[It] is riding on the top of this tide of an ever-warming planet from carbon pollution, from the burning of fossil fuels, and that heat is not just at the surface, it\u2019s penetrating deeper into those ocean layers and that\u2019s when you see \u2026 these rapid intensification events.\u201dMann said El Ni\u00f1o weather systems lead to more wind shear, which \u201ctends to interfere with hurricanes\u201d, so experts had thought this would be an average or just above average year for storms, but the record ocean temperatures were changing that picture.\u201cExcessive warmth is overcoming the typical dampening effect of the El Ni\u00f1o event \u2026 Conditions right now are going to support those major, monster cat[egory] 4 and cat[egory] 5 hurricanes if they have a chance to form.\u201d",

        "text": "One million lorries of sand a day are being extracted from the world\u2019s oceans, posing a \u201csignificant\u201d threat to marine life and coastal communities facing rising sea levels and storms, according to the first-ever global data platform to monitor the industry.The new data platform, developed by the UN Environment Programme (Unep), tracks and monitors dredging of sand in the marine environment by using the AIS (automatic identification systems) data from ships. Using data from 2012-19, Marine Sand Watch estimates the dredging industry is digging up 6bn tonnes of marine sand a year, a scale described as \u201calarming\u201d. The rate of extraction is growing globally, Unep said, and is approaching the natural rate of replenishment of 10bn to 16bn tonnes of sand flowing into the sea from rivers and needed to maintain coastal structure and ecosystems.The platform has identified \u201chotspots\u201d including the North Sea, south-east Asia and the east coast of the United States as areas of concern. In many places where extraction is more intense, including parts of Asia, marine sand is being extracted well beyond the rate at which it is being replenished from rivers.\u201cThe scale of environmental impacts of shallow sea mining activities and dredging is alarming, including biodiversity, water turbidity, and noise impacts on marine mammals,\u201d said Pascal Peduzzi, the director of GRID-Geneva at Unep.\u201cThis data signals the urgent need for better management of marine sand resources and to reduce the impacts of shallow sea mining,\u201d he said. \u201cUnep invites all stakeholders, member states and the dredging sector to consider sand as a strategic material, and to swiftly engage in talks on how to improve dredging standards around the world.\u201dDeveloped by GRID-Geneva, a centre for analytics within Unep, Marine Sand Watch has trained artificial intelligence to identify the movement of dredging vessels from its AIS data. It has data from 2012-19 from Global Fishing Watch, a company set up to track commercial fishing activities using AIS data from fishing vessels, but is working on more recent data.Sand and gravel makes up half of all the materials mined in the world. Globally, 50bn tonnes of sand and gravel are used every year \u2013 the equivalent of a wall 27 metres high and 27 metres wide stretching round the equator. It is the key ingredient of concrete and asphalt.\u201cOur entire society is built on sand, the floor of your building is probably concrete, the glass on the windows, the asphalt on roads is made of sand,\u201d said Peduzzi. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop doing it because we need lots of concrete for the green transition, for wind turbines and other things.\u201dLast year, Unep called for better monitoring of sand extraction and use to avert an environmental crisis. It recommended a halt to mining on beaches and to establish an international standard for extraction in the marine environment.While extracting sand from quarries on land can, to some extent, be restored, extracting sand and other materials from the marine and river environment will change the shape of a river or coastline and \u201csterilise the bottom of the sea. It is very damaging,\u201d said Peduzzi.\u201cThese vessels are like a giant vacuum cleaner on the bottom of the sea,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the micro-organisms in the sand are crunched and nothing is left behind. If you take all the sand away to bare rock, nothing will recover. But if you leave 30-50cm it will recover.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Already, the platform has achieved its first aim, to highlight the problem, he said.The International Association of Dredging Companies (IADC), the umbrella organisation for the industry, on Tuesday launched a paper on best practice for responsible dredging of the \u201cscant resource\u201d. Overall, the aggregate industry is worth hundreds of billions of dollars annually.While international practices and regulations vary, some countries, including Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia, have banned marine sand export. The work by Unep/GRID-Geneva follows a UN environment assembly resolution to strengthen scientific, technical and policy knowledge and to support global policies and action on environmentally sound extraction and use of sand.China, which has 200 dredging vessels, is developing a record-breaking dredger 50% more powerful than its existing \u201csuper island builder in the South China Sea\u201d, according to reports this year.",

Campaigners have emphasised the apparent contradiction with Scotland\u2019s view of itself as an ambitious climate leader, particularly following its hosting of Cop26 in 2021.Now, that contradiction has been brought into sharp focus as Glasgow City Council gets set to consider plans for a drive-through Starbucks in the central Gorbals area in the same week as the city\u2019s low emissions zone comes into force less than a mile away.\u201cThe proposal is totally unnecessary, utterly short-sighted and entirely counterintuitive,\u201d said Labour MSP Paul Sweeney, who is among those objecting. \u201cWe should continue Glasgow\u2019s progress by rejecting... proposals of this kind every step of the way.\u201dOne Glasgow resident told the Observer they felt \u201ccrowded out\u201d by new drive-throughs. \u201cThey don\u2019t just encourage cars, they make it harder and more dangerous to walk and cycle nearby,\u201d they said. \u201cIt\u2019s like cars have more rights than people.\u201dOther objections come from councillors and community groups, including nearby Gorbals Parish Church, which highlights environmental concerns, as well as pointing out that the proposed site is in an area of high deprivation and lower than average car ownership, making the development unlikely to benefit locals.It joins a growing movement of campaigns across Scotland formed to oppose drive-throughs on the basis of health, safety and community benefit. In Glasgow\u2019s west end, Love Thornwood was set up in opposition to Burger King and Starbucks drive-throughs built on green space, and continues to monitor accidents and air quality at the site. Elsewhere, campaigners have successfully halted plans for McDonald\u2019s drive-throughs in East Lothian and Fife, and a Greggs site in Falkirk.Glasgow is not going to meet its targets with business-as-usual approaches to developmentPatrick Harvie, Green MSPSince last year, the Scottish Greens have called for a total moratorium on all new drive-throughs in Glasgow, noting that the city is home to more than Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen combined, the vast majority run by multinational corporations.\u201cThis is about what we want our cities to look like in 10 years\u2019 time,\u201d said Scottish Greens co-leader and MSP Patrick Harvie. \u201cGlasgow is not going to meet its targets with business-as-usual approaches to development.\u201d\u201cCities that have made that shift away from cars are vibrant, pleasant, enjoyable places with high levels of walking and cycling,\u201d Harvie continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the vision we should have for Glasgow and Scotland, [not] profit from the community into a multinational\u2019s balance sheet.\u201dWhile Glasgow is particularly affected, drive-throughs operated by Costa and Tim Hortons in Edinburgh and Aberdeen are among those currently under construction.The continued approval of such plans is \u201cparticularly frustrating\u201d in the light of new Scottish government planning policy which says local decisions should be made with regard to the Scottish government\u2019s net zero 2045 target, says James White, professor of planning and urban design at the University of Glasgow.\u201cIt\u2019s a clear demonstration of the implementation gap between national net zero objectives and local planning decisions, but also a failure of local authorities to implement the policies they have set themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cDrive-through restaurants of any sort fall well short of efforts to create more walkable cities and make a mockery of other efforts by local authorities to encourage more sustainable behaviour.\u201dStarbucks and Glasgow City Council did not respond to requests for comment.",

It also prevents any other local governments from passing similar worker protections.Texas governor Greg Abbott sends \u20181st bus\u2019 of migrants to Los AngelesRead moreJust days after Greg Abbott, the governor, ratified the law, officials said a 35-year-old utility lineman working to restore power in Marshall, Texas, died after experiencing symptoms of heat illness. The heat index \u2013 which takes into account both the temperature and humidity \u2013 was 100F (37C) while he was working.It was an omen of what could come after HB 2127 takes effect in September, wrote the Texas branch of the AFL-CIO union, referring to the far-reaching law that not only curbs cities\u2019 right to enact worker protections, but a number of labor, agriculture, natural resources and finance measures. \u201cBanning required rest breaks for construction workers in the Texas heat is deadly.\u201dThe law\u2019s passage has enraged workers\u2019 advocates, who warn that it will result in even more heat-related deaths and illnesses in a state that already tallies the highest number of worker deaths due to high temperatures.\u201cIn the midst of a record-setting heatwave, I could not think of a worse time for this governor or any elected official who has any, any kind of compassion, to do this,\u201d said David Cruz, the communications director for League of United Latin American Citizens National (Lulac), a Latino civil rights group. \u201cThis administration is incrementally trying to move us backwards into a dark time in this nation. When plantation owners and agrarian mentalities prevailed.\u201dSix out of every 10 construction workers in Texas are Latino, and labor advocates say that the law will hurt Latino and Black communities that are already disproportionately affected by extreme heat. Hispanic workers made up a third of all worker heat deaths since 2010, according to an NPR/Columbia study.Local protections are crucial, advocates say, because the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) does not have a national heat protection standard.Still, the Republican lawmakers pushing the new law have said it eliminates a \u201chodgepodge of onerous and burdensome regulations\u201d that Texas businesses face. The effort aims to prevent cities and counties from enacting progressive policies that counter the state Republican supermajority\u2019s aims.\u201cFor too long, progressive municipal officials and agencies have made Texas small businesses jump through contradictory and confusing hoops,\u201d said the Republican state representative Dustin Burrows, who introduced the bill.After the state\u2019s second-hottest summer on record last year, Democratic legislators introduced bills that would have set heat illness guidelines for Texas businesses and required mandatory breaks for government contractors, but those efforts failed to advance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I\u2019m not one for sowing seeds early, but tomatoes and aubergines need every day of the growing season in this country to offer up the best possible harvest. Last summer, the tomatoes were incredible: they thrived in that mind-bending heatwave. They more than made up for the year before when blight obliterated every plant before even one tomato had dared to ripen. No two years are ever the same in the veg patch.Gardeners and growers are well versed in the nature of change. Understanding how the shifting seasons and weather patterns affect our plants enables us to determine when our interventions will be most timely. This year, gardeners at the Royal Horticultural Society, who have been studying buds across the country, are reportedly expecting a bumper blossom in spring. The combination of last year\u2019s heat and light with the cold snap this February is expected to produce ideal conditions for flowering.That said, there\u2019s always an element of guesswork, as we watch the sky and the mercury, check our diaries and last year\u2019s notes, then try to guess when the last frost will pass. We attempt to follow the gardening calendar even though so little in our gardens can be accurately predicted.Despite what plants have taught me about living and working with forces beyond my control, I\u2019m nonetheless prone to bouts of climate anxiety. All it takes is a few days of unexpectedly erratic weather for panic to rise up in my throat. The sheer scale of the climate crisis has felt so overwhelming at times that I\u2019ve found myself succumbing to hopelessness at times. Yet, it is through working with plants that I\u2019ve found an antidote to this particular angst \u2013 to pay even more attention to the wonder of the natural world instead of choosing to turn away. And right now, as winter gives way to spring, is the ideal time to institute a practice of noticing.What that looks like for me is simply taking a few moments, whenever possible, to step outside and pause for long enough to notice what\u2019s emerged or transformed. On the days I spend with my crops, I resist the urge to dive straight into all there is to do; instead I first stop to observe what\u2019s new and what\u2019s changed \u2013 even if all that does is add more tasks to my list. Photograph: Rachel Husband/AlamyAfter this winter, which has felt especially long and cold, I am ready for a change in season. I\u2019m hungrily searching for green shoots and swelling buds. I\u2019m listening out for the symphony of tenacious birdsong as dawn breaks earlier each day. I\u2019m drinking in all the signs of new life that remind me that spring has always come and will in all likelihood be beautiful. When anxiety-inducing headlines have me feeling disempowered and wanting to disengage, I cultivate my sense of inherent connection to the natural world. This simply feels more possible in spring.Whether it\u2019s the northern lights, shimmering hues of purple and green through the night skies over Wensleydale, the swathes of blossom that are predicted to adorn the weeks to come or the best tomatoes I\u2019ve ever grown, the natural world consistently proves worthy of our worshipful attention. And I take all these demonstrations of nature\u2019s beauty and abundance to be urgent reminders of what we are being called to protect. Despite the very real challenges and dangers we face in this time of climate crisis, the natural world insists on showing us what resilience and optimism look like and it\u2019s our responsibility to take note and follow suit.As I write these words, I have a blanket on my knees but the window slightly open to allow a sliver of the cool breeze to blow in. The world feels fresh and enlivening and brimming with new energy. My tomato seeds are yet to germinate but I trust that they will. I trust that the plants I grow this season will thrive. And I know that spring, hopefully one that\u2019s overflowing with blossom, is already on its way.\nClaire Ratinon is an organic food grower and writer\n",

Scientists say that the heatwave raised sea surface temperatures, which could have encouraged the formation of a Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone, or \u201cmedicane\u201d.\u201cWhile no formal attribution of the role of climate change in making Storm Daniel more intense has been conducted yet, it is safe to say that the Mediterranean sea surface temperatures have been considerably above average throughout summer,\u201d said Dr Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at Leipzig University.\u201cThis is certainly true for the region where Daniel could form and wreak havoc over Greece and now Libya \u2026 The warmer water does not only fuel those storms in terms of rainfall intensity, it also makes them more ferocious.\u201dBut the storm itself was not wholly to blame for the destruction wreaked on Derna, where infrastructure, including the burst dams, was already in a parlous state, according to experts. More than a decade after Libya\u2019s cities were bombarded by Nato navies and warplanes supporting a revolt against Muammar Gaddafi, its former longtime ruler, the oil-rich country remains a shadow of its former prosperity. Like many poorer countries, Libya simply was not ready for the extreme weather Daniel brought.\u201cIt is important to recognise that the storm itself is not just the single cause of the loss of life,\u201d said Dr Kevin Collins, a senior lecturer on environment and systems at the Open University.\u201cIt is also partly a function of Libya\u2019s limited ability to forecast weather impacts; limited warning and evacuation systems; and planning and design standards for infrastructure and cities.\u201cAs our climate changes, understanding, planning for and adapting to these more extreme types of events needs to be done by individuals, businesses, and communities in all countries.\u201dProf Lizzie Kendon, professor of climate science at the University of Bristol Cabot Institute for the Environment, said: \u201cWe expect the intensity of heavy rainfall to increase as the world warms. This will not be realised as a smooth trend, and we should expect the occurrence of extreme events unprecedented in the observational record.\u201cStorm Daniel is illustrative of the type of devastating flooding event we may expect increasingly in the future, but such events can occur just due to the natural variability of the climate \u2013 as they did in the past. Therefore, care is needed before linking any specific extreme event to climate change.\u201d",

Molluscs are particularly sensitive to it.International Paint was fined \u00a3650,000 and ordered to pay costs of \u00a3145,000. The company has agreed to cover costs of remediation works, likely to be at least \u00a3500,000.Sentencing the company, which is owned by the multinational AkzoNobel, recorder Simon Levene said it had stopped using TBT in 2002 and should have cleaned out the tank years ago. He said it was \u201csuspicious\u201d that the discharge happened after the site was put up for sale.The judge said: \u201cThough I don\u2019t believe anybody directed the TBT should be washed out of the tanks, it is suspicious that the TBT was only discharged when a potential purchaser for whom the presence of TBT in the tanks was a serious problem came along.\u201dHe added: \u201cI am quite satisfied that the defendant, having closed its eyes for years to the problem, operated a reckless system in which it utterly failed to control the management of TBT and other chemicals. I\u2019m satisfied that [a caretaker] emptied the TBT into the estuary and that is something that should never have been allowed to happen.\u201dThe judge, sitting at Plymouth crown court, also raised concerns about what he called \u201castronomic\u201d levels of mercury that were also found in the river. The Food Standards Agency is to investigate whether this could have got into the human food chain via shellfish.International Paint Ltd had denied two charges relating to the discharge of hazardous waste from a tank located on the quay at its Newton Ferrers paint testing facility, but was found guilty by a jury.The court heard that The Environment Agency launched an investigation after the company tried to sell the premises and possible pollution was reported.International Paint Ltd had run a testing facility on the Yealm at Newton Creek near Newton Ferrers since 1928. The company stopped using TBT in the early 2000s and the site was decommissioned in 2013. But the TBT and other chemicals were not cleared, and in 2016 the caretaker flushed the contents out into the river. The judge said the river had been a \u201cpristine environment\u201d before the incident.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

He concluded that the TBT levels were sufficient to have had a major toxic effect on marine life there.A report presented to the court revealed that data collected in December 2022 showed there had been \u201clittle or no reduction in the concentrations of TBT close to the International Paint site \u2026 The reservoir of TBT debris is highly persistent and it will continue to release TBT to the sediment for many more years.\u201d However, it did say that the pollution did not appear to have spread widely in the estuary.International Paint Limited said it took full responsibility for the incident. A spokesperson, Ralph Slikkerveer, said: \u201cWe take our environmental obligations very seriously.

These include the Acorn CCS project designed to support the decarbonisation of two St Fergus gas terminals in Aberdeenshire, and Viking CCS, a 34-mile pipeline that will take carbon from industrial sites on Humberside and lock it under the North Sea.The government hopes to store 20-30m tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030, equal to the emissions from 10-15m cars. Britain has set a legal target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.Its attempts to build new UK nuclear power capacity have been beset by a series of false starts including delays and overruns to construction of new plants at Hinkley Point C in Somerset and a lengthy process in finding funding for the proposed Sizewell C power station in Suffolk.On Friday, the government said that Great British Nuclear, its newly formed delivery vehicle for nuclear projects, would run a competition to develop SMRs.The government is investing \u00a3210m into the Rolls-Royce SMR project, which has been matched by private sector funding.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

UK food retailers, hospitality businesses and consumers were in line for major disruption because many EU food-producing businesses supplying into the UK are not ready for the new requirements,\u201d said Shane Brennan, the chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation.He was concerned that EU producers, some of whom are small producers of specialist products such as cheese, were not even aware of the new requirements that could also have led to shortages on shelves.Another industry source said it was a \u201cTreasury purge\u201d of all changes that would cause disruption to the supply chain, given the sensitivity of the food market to price increases in the current economic climate.Before Brexit, exporters could send chilled and fresh food to the EU without any paperwork because the UK was a member of the single market.Since the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, fresh and chilled foods such as sausages or cheese, along with animal and plant products including timber and leather, are subject to sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks and can only be exported with a health or veterinary certificate.Exporters from the EU have not had to endure the paperwork after the British government failed to build new SPS systems or secure land for SPS parks to conduct random physical checks.The Brexit cliff-edge in 2021 left British exporters of fish and other fresh goods in chaos with a lack of customs agents and veterinary staff to certify whether the produce complied with EU standards.But in the UK Brexit checks were pushed back in 2020, on two occasions in 2021 and then again last year by the then Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg.In April the government announced the checks would finally be phased in from 31 October, with further checks implemented in 2023 and 2024.The checks in October were to involve paperwork known as \u201cpre-certification\u201d that would alert authorities to the arrival of food products with public health compliance requirements.It is expected these checks will now be pushed back to the end of January when the physical SPS checks are due to become operational.Government insiders told the FT that further details of the rules applying to food imports would be published \u201cvery soon\u201d but the introduction would be pushed back.\u201cThe driving force behind this is the need to bear down on inflation, that\u2019s why there will be a delay. There will be additional costs at the border,\u201d the FT said, quoting its sources.A cabinet office spokesperson said it was reflecting on \u201cvaluable feedback provided by a range of businesses and industry stakeholders\u201d and would be publishing more details of the border operating model shortly.It said it was best to \u201cprogressively\u201d introduce the checks.",

People on a beach and in two communities near the blaze were ordered to evacuate, AFP reported.Another wildfire broke out on the island of Evia on Monday and at least four more were raging in north-eastern Greece in the regions of Rodopi and Kavala, Aspropyrgos west of Athens, and north-east Greece near the port city of Alexandroupolis, where 13 communities were evacuated over the weekend.The EU said it was deploying two Cyprus-based firefighting aircraft and a Romanian firefighting team via the bloc\u2019s civil protection mechanism amid what it called \u201cby far Greece\u2019s worst summer\u201d for wildfires since 2008.Civil protection authorities warned of an \u201cexceptional\u201d fire risk in the region around Athens and other parts of southern Greece. \u201cWe are facing extreme phenomena,\u201d a fire service spokesperson said, urging people to follow authorities\u2019 instructions.In Spain, the state weather agency, Aemet, has placed five provinces in the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda on amber heat alert, warning that temperatures are forecast to rise to more than 40C around Seville, C\u00f3rdoba and in the Guadalquivir valley.In the Canary Islands, 600 firefighters were making progress, however, battling an out-of-control blaze on Tenerife that was started deliberately and has forced more than 12,000 people to flee their homes and burned through more than 12,800 hectares (31,600 acres) of land, about 6.5% of Tenerife\u2019s surface area.The prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said during a visit to the island that he hoped better conditions would \u201chelp us declare the fire as stabilised in the coming hours, coming days.

The initiative was promoted by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and local and state governments across the country.In May, ABC News and affiliates used digital tracking devices to monitor plastic waste dropped off at Walmart and Target stores listed on the directory. Of the 46 trackers placed, the vast majority never ended up at locations associated with plastic bag recycling.\u201cPlastic film recycling had been an abysmal failure for decades and it\u2019s important that plastic companies stop lying to the public,\u201d said Judith Enck, president of advocacy group Beyond Plastics. \u201cFinally, the truth is coming out.\u201dPlastics are a major contributor to the climate crisis. Made from oil and gas, the materials are set to drive nearly half of oil demand growth by midcentury, according to the US International Energy Agency.Producing the materials requires fossil fuel extraction, refining and \u201ccracking\u201d in special high-heat facilities, and plastic waste often ends up in landfills and waste incinerators. Each step produces planet-heating and toxic emissions.Already, the production and disposal of plastics account for 3.4% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says, and that number is slated to rise.Nina Bellucci Butler, CEO of Stina Inc, which managed the directory, cited a serious lack of commitment from industry partners in the decision to shutter the initiative, as well as meager demand for recycled plastics.\u201cIt\u2019s a fine line between maintaining a credible resource to help people find the best option for the common household items that are not easy to eliminate \u2026 and enabling greenwashing,\u201d she wrote in an email.She said a lack of adequate funding for the project and the plastic recycling sector at large also contributed to the decision to take down the site. The project was initially funded by the American Chemistry Council, a plastic industry lobbying group which has lobbied against many US environmental regulations, but Butler said it had been self-funded for almost a year before closing down last month.The directory\u2019s demise is indicative of a larger problem in the plastics recycling sector. Of the 51m tons of plastic waste US households generated in 2021, just 2.4m tons \u2013 or 5% \u2013 was recycled, a Greenpeace report found last year.A major hurdle: plastic materials are expensive to collect and sort. There are thousands of different kinds of the material, and none of them can be melted down together. Even plastics of the same category often can\u2019t be recycled together \u2013 bottles that are dyed green or blue, for instance, can\u2019t be processed with clear bottles made of the same kind of plastic, and few facilities have the capacity to sort so many different materials, the Greenpeace report found.Industry interests have long insisted that plastic recycling can be improved, yet report after report shows recycling is failing to rein in the problem.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "The World Bank poured billions of dollars into fossil fuels around the world last year despite repeated promises to refocus on shifting to a low-carbon economy, research has suggested.The money went through a special form of funding known as trade finance, which is used to facilitate global transactions.Urgewald, a campaign group that tracks global fossil fuel finance, found that the World Bank supplied about $3.7bn (\u00a32.95bn) in trade finance in 2022 that was likely to have ended up funding oil and gas developments.Heike Mainhardt, the author of the research, called for reform of the World Bank and its private finance arm, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), to make such transactions more transparent and to exclude funding for fossil fuels from its lending. \u201cThey can\u2019t say that they are aligned with the Paris agreement, because there isn\u2019t enough transparency to be able to tell,\u201d she said.Fossil fuel companies would take advantage of this, she added. \u201cThey can see that they can access public money this way, without drawing attention to themselves, and they\u2019re very clever, so they will do this,\u201d she told the Guardian.Trade finance is a form of funding more opaque than standard project finance. Whereas project finance usually flows to governments, organisations or consortiums for a particular well-defined purpose and is relatively easy to track, trade finance is more diffuse.It comprises numerous complex financial instruments used by banks and other financial institutions to provide working capital to governments or businesses. Trade finance can take the form of credit or guarantees, and is an important tool for the World Bank as it helps to \u201cde-risk\u201d financing to developing countries, which are often penalised by higher than normal interest rates when they try to raise finance privately.For instance, if an oil developer in Nigeria wanted to import drilling or refining equipment, trade finance could provide a guarantee to the equipment manufacturer that the payment for the goods would be made. There is no way of knowing whether such a transaction has taken place, however, as the IFC does not disclose such detail.Mainhardt studied the trade finance transactions by the IFC, and applied estimates based on the amounts of financing that went to oil and gas developments from 2006 to 2012, the last dates for which reliable estimates are available. The overall proportions directed to fossil fuels are unlikely to have changed much, as the IFC continues to deal heavily with oil producers, particularly in the Middle East and Africa, and oil, gas and coal are not excluded from the trade finance transactions it permits.Many countries, developed and developing, are now pushing for reform of the World Bank, which they say needs to refocus its efforts on shifting to a low-carbon global economy.

Second, we need oil, gas and coal to be on the exclusion list [which would prevent the IFC financing such transactions],\u201d she said.An IFC spokesperson said: \u201cUrgewald\u2019s report contains serious factual inaccuracies and grossly overstates IFC\u2019s support for fossil fuels. IFC\u2019s trade finance projects are selected through a rigorous process that balances climate commitments with the urgent development needs in the countries where we work.

It adds to growing evidence of blurred lines between the UAE\u2019s Cop28 team and its fossil fuel industry.In January, Adnoc\u2019s chief executive, Sultan Al Jaber, who also serves as the UAE\u2019s climate change special envoy, was announced as Cop28 president, which is being hosted in Dubai in November and December. Since then, multiple reports have raised concerns about ties between his two teams. The Cop28 team previously stated that there were \u201cclear governance guidelines in place to ensure the team can operate entirely independently from any other entity\u201d.\u201cIt is wholly inappropriate for Adnoc staff to be doing PR for Cop28,\u201d said Pascoe Sabido, a researcher from Corporate Observatory Europe who co-coordinates the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition. He says the findings clearly demonstrate the close links between the oil company and the summit team.Earlier this year, CCR and the Guardian revealed that several members of Adnoc staff had taken up important roles at the summit, including as climate negotiators. Some had even been seconded from ongoing roles with the oil company.In June, the Guardian reported that Adnoc and Cop28 shared an IT system and that Adnoc staff were able to read emails sent to and from the Cop28 team. Adnoc had also been consulted on how to respond to a media inquiry about the summit. At the time, the Cop28 team insisted that the emails were held on a \u201cstandalone, firewall-protected network\u201d.The two Adnoc communications executives named in the leaked document \u2013 Philip Robinson and Paloma Berenguer \u2013 have a combined 28 years of experience in the fossil fuel industry, according to their LinkedIn accounts. They both previously worked for Shell before joining Adnoc.A Cop28 spokesperson said the two executives had not travelled as part of its team to New York for the UN general assembly this week and had not been involved in communications activities there.\u201cThe COop28 team regularly receives queries not related to Cop28 that it directs to the appropriate UAE entities to answer,\u201d the spokesperson continued.The document lays out the Cop28 team\u2019s public relations strategy and key talking points for Al Jaber and senior team members, who are attending the UN general assembly. The meeting at the UN will \u201cset the tone, inform the climate agenda and shape the climate narrative in the lead up to Cop28\u201d, the document states.Speaking at the UN on Wednesday, Al Jaber reiterated that a \u201cphase down\u201d of fossil fuels was inevitable and essential. But he stopped short of calling for a complete phase-out, which the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has said is necessary to abate global heating.\u201cActions are falling abysmally short,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cTo stand a fighting chance of limiting global temperature rise, we must phase out oil, coal and gas in a fair and equitable way.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This brings the total number of certified heat pumps installed across the country to more than 200,000.The industry\u2019s accreditation body, the MCS, said there was a late surge in demand for heat pumps after the government increased the grants available through its boiler upgrade scheme from \u00a35,000 for an air-source heat pump to \u00a37,500 in October. Applications for the grant increased by 50% after the introduction of the higher rate, it said.However, the MCS Foundation, which oversees the body\u2019s standards scheme, said the UK was still falling short in its goal to reduce its reliance on gas, which is considered a crucial step in meeting Britain\u2019s legally binding climate targets.It added that the installation of heat pumps would have increase more than tenfold within the next four years to meet the government target of 600,000 a year by 2028.David Cowdrey, the director of external affairs at the foundation, said the industry would still need additional government policies, on top of the higher grants, to achieve \u201cthe exponential growth\u201d that was \u201crequired now\u201d.He called on the government to move social and environmental tariffs from energy bills into general taxation in order to reduce electricity costs and make running heat pumps substantially cheaper than a gas boiler.Charlotte Lee, the chief executive of the Heat Pump Association, a trade body, said: \u201cWith consumer demand for heat pumps rising, we encourage all heating engineers to look ahead and invest in heat pump installation training to support the anticipated deployment and to future-proof their business.\u201dSolar installations fell short of the record 203,000 in 2011, when people rushed to take advantage of the amount they received from the feed-in-tariff support scheme before it was slashed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The discovery of a species that was abundant in the age of the dinosaurs but which was thought to have disappeared from large swaths of North America has stoked speculation that there may be entire populations tucked away in remote parts of the Ozark mountains.US farmers face plague of pests as global heating raises soil temperaturesRead moreThe giant lacewing was found by Michael Skvarla, director of Penn State\u2019s insect identification lab. In a report on the university\u2019s website this week, he explained that he made the discovery in 2012, when he was a doctoral student at the University of Arkansas.\u201cI remember it vividly, because I was walking into Walmart to get milk and I saw this huge insect on the side of the building,\u201d Skvarla said.\u201cI thought it looked interesting, so I put it in my hand and did the rest of my shopping with it between my fingers. I got home, mounted it, and promptly forgot about it for almost a decade.\u201dIn a co-authored paper recently published in the Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington, Skvarla said that the specimen was incorrectly labelled in his personal collection as an \u201cantlion\u201d, an insect with similar features.The correct designation of the lacewing had to wait until late 2020, when Skvarla was teaching a Zoom class on biodiversity during the Covid lockdown. As teacher and students stared down at microscopic images, they realized the specimen had been wrongly labelled.\u201cAll of a sudden, out of nowhere, this incredible new record pops up,\u201d Louis Nastasi, a member of the class, told Adrienne Berard, author of the Penn State report.The giant lacewing was once abundant across North America but was assumed to have been obliterated from eastern regions by the 1950s. It has been portrayed as resembling a cross between a fly and a moth, with mottled wings which it holds tent-like over its body.The causes of the apparent disappearance of the insect have long been a mystery. Possible explanations include light pollution through urbanization and the introduction of non-native species such as ground beetles that prey on the lacewing or earthworms, which can change the consistency of soil.Suppression of forest fires in the eastern region may also play a part, as giant lacewings depend on post-fire ecosystems.",

In its earlier, milder form, the storm caused severe damage in Greece before it crossed the Mediterranean.Libya flooding: before and after satellite images reveal scale of disaster in DernaRead moreNevertheless, the extent of the devastation \u2013 a quarter of a city was swept into the sea in what is being described as Libya\u2019s 9/11 \u2013 is also a function of the country\u2019s failed politics.After the bloody western-backed ousting of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, the country has mainly been governed by two rival administrations, one in Tripoli and the other in Tobruk, each supported by an assembly of rival external actors including Turkey, the UAE, Qatar, Egypt and Russia\u2019s Wagner group.Under Gaddafi\u2019s pseudo-socialism in the late 1970s and 80s, the dictator dismantled oil-rich Libya\u2019s private sector through the administration of state-owned companies, shattering the independent powerbase of the upper classes. \u201cState enterprises became patronage networks,\u201d explains Wolfram Lacher, the co-editor of a recently published collection of essays, Violence and Social Transformation in Libya.Post-Gaddafi, the two sides have been similarly centralised. Ministers in the government of national unity, based in the west of the country, were nominated by militia. In the east, a relentless centralisation drive by the authoritarian head of the Libyan National Army, Gen Khalifa Haftar, and his family similarly ended up with numerous executives nominated by Haftar or his associates.MapThe two sides were at all-out war as recently as 2020. Hafter\u2019s forces besieged Tripoli in a year-long failed military campaign to try to capture the capital in which thousands of people were killed. Then in 2022, the former leader of the eastern administration Fathi Bashagha tried to move his government into Tripoli before clashes between rival militias forced him to withdraw. This rumbling, mostly low-intensity conflict, requiring leaders to assuage their base with handouts, is the worst environment in which to make infrastructure investments that reap rewards only in the long term.Bringing this context to Derna, the city that has long suffered since Gaddafi\u2019s demise, either by being in the hands of Islamic State or since its recapture by Haftar in 2016, and infrastructure investment has always been at a premium. Haftar, whose secondary education was in the city, has also tried to keep close control of the Derna\u2019s politics.Municipal city council elections were scheduled to be held this month, with lists and voter registration compiled. In recent weeks, however, members of the Awliya al-Dam brigades loyal to Haftar burned campaign posters and threatened candidates with kidnapping and murder, demanding the cancellation of the elections and the installation of a military governor in the city. The head of the electoral commission reported he was being threatened. Aguila Saleh, the speaker of the House of Representatives in eastern-based parliament, proposed forming a temporary management council, a way of deferring the poll.The two large dams built in the narrow valley above Derna were an accident waiting to happen, especially because poorly constructed housing built close to the river had become increasingly dense and high-rise. Built in the 1970s by a Yugoslav company, the risk posed by the two dams and their state of decay was the subject of a lengthy academic article in 2022, calculating what weight of water would crush them and how it might run off given the topography.00:01:40Libya: thousands missing after dam collapse causes massive flooding \u2013 video reportMoney was set aside for work on the dams, but an audit circulating online shows little of it seems to have been spent. Once the flood waters overwhelmed the first dam they quickly accumulated behind the second, causing it, too, to burst.Nor were instructions given to mount an evacuation as the storm neared. Instead a curfew was imposed, the standard response of Libyan militias to any crisis.It is yet to be seen if the politicians who had a role in leaving Derna so exposed to nature will be washed away along with the buildings that collapsed into the swollen river. The lesson of the past few years is that in both the east and west they have an astonishing ability to survive.",

It held out hope that stricter controls might do so. \u201cInterventions that deliver larger reductions in emissions might yield improvements in children\u2019s health,\u201d wrote the authors.",

The total allowable catch for 2023 is 9,960kg, unchanged over the last 18 years.In recent years, however, Indigenous nations have grown frustrated that their treaty rights have not been recognised by the federal government. Canada\u2019s supreme court has previously ruled that Indigenous peoples have a right harvest from the land and water in order to obtain a \u201cmoderate livelihood\u201d \u2013 a term the federal government repeatedly failed to define over the years, frustrating both Indigenous and non-Indigenous fishers and leading to tense standoffs.In 2020, officials stopped the eel harvest after Mi\u2019kmaw fishers joined commercial licence-holders in harvesting the region\u2019s rivers, complicating the federal department\u2019s ability to manage the total catch.In an attempt to remedy longstanding frustrations, the federal government has granted Indigenous communities a growing share of the commercial quota. This year, nations have been allocated 14% of the commercial harvest.To enforce the ban fisheries officers will increase patrols at rivers and conduct more inspections at airports and border crossings.Already this season, the department says, it has conducted nearly 750 patrols from 13 March 13 to 10 April, resulting in the seizure of 35.8kg of elvers, including 25kg at Halifax airport, worth more than C$125,000.",

Maybe the time I taught bush kinder children the local bird calls so we could chat to our feathery friends out on country. Most likely, though, it was the point at which I became hopelessly obsessed with a little bird named mukarrthippi and its entanglement with my family history.\u2018Watching extinction in real time\u2019: conservationists losing hope for Australia\u2019s swift parrot if logging continues #birdoftheyearRead moreMukarrthippi (pronounced mook-waa-tippy) captured my heart, not just because of its charismatic rufous-brown eyebrows, alert upturned tail and striking white streaked body, but also for the rather dubious honour it holds of potentially being Australia\u2019s rarest bird. A recent survey estimates that fewer than 20 individuals exist in the world, most of whom reside in a single small area of sandhill in what is now known as Yathong Nature Reserve.\nSign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads\nBack when my dad was a boy, this area was known simply as Yathong Station, a vast 250,000-acre sheep station built on the dry, sprawling mallee country of central New South Wales. More than two generations of my family lived and worked at Yathong from the late 1890s onwards. My great-great-grandmother\u2019s people, the Ngiyampaa-Wangaaypuwan, were there for millennia before that and no doubt witnessed the decimation of the landscape under the cloven feet of sheep herds and subsequent waves of feral rabbits and goats that arrived in plague proportions after colonisation.These days an enormous predator-proof fence encircles more than 40,000 hectares of Yathong, which is categorised as an asset of intergenerational significance, a classification that allows the NSW Parks and Wildlife Service to prioritise rapid intervention strategies in response to emerging ecological threats. These interventions have provided some much-needed relief for mukarrthippi, which prefers building dome shaped nests among the spinifex grass at ground level, making it particularly vulnerable to predation by feral cats and foxes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Five Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

A recent conservation report on the species stated that it is plausible that the entire habitat of this tiny, localised population could be extinguished within a single fire event \u2013 which, with ongoing droughts and lack of regular fire management regimes, has become an ever-increasing possibility.With the future of the little mukarrthippi hanging in the balance, it feels more important than ever that all of us begin to connect with the native species in our area and the ecosystems that support them. With an estimated one in six Australian birds currently under threat, it\u2019s likely there\u2019s a bird not too far from you that could be in the mukarrthippi\u2019s place in just a few decades\u2019 time.So even if you\u2019re not ready to proudly rock the title of \u201cbird nerd\u201d yet (give it time!), perhaps next time you\u2019re out for a walk, when no one else is around, you might let loose your best bird call, and maybe forge a new connection with a local feathery friend.\nCast your vote in the Australian bird of the year poll today\nKeep up with all our bird of the year content\n",

It disproportionately affects children and poorer Londoners.London ultra-low emission zone mapKhan said: \u201cTackling London\u2019s lethal air and safeguarding the health of Londoners requires bold action. Air pollution is a national health crisis and I refuse to stand back as thousands of Londoners breathe in air so filthy that it shortens our life expectancy, harms our lungs and worsens chronic illness.\u201dUnveiling the plans at a London primary school on Friday, the London mayor announced a four-year study looking at the impact of toxic air on the health of 3,000 primary schoolchildren.The project, led by scientists at Queen Mary University of London, will compare the health of children in the capital with those in polluted areas of Luton where there is no low-emission zone planned.Children are especially vulnerable to traffic pollution, with evidence showing stunted lung growth in polluted areas worldwide, leaving them at risk of lifelong breathing disorders and earlier death. Pollution also triggers asthma, asthma attacks and chest infections.Once the zone is extended to the North Circular and South Circular, it will cover a huge area of London, and officials estimate 100,000 cars, 35,000 vans and 3,000 lorries will be affected per day.It will also include a \u201cparticulate matter standard\u201d, after the Guardian revealed every part of London exceeds World Health Organization air quality guidelines for PM2.5 \u2013 the most dangerous particulate.Paul Morozzo, a clean air campaigner at Greenpeace, said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to have a huge impact on air quality and make a real difference to Londoners\u2019 quality of life. London is leading the way in tackling harmful air pollution.\u201dThe government is being taken to the European court of justice for failing to tackle illegal levels of air pollution, and Morozzon said its response to the crisis had been \u201cshameful\u201d.\u201cThe government must fund and support cities around the country to offer the same level of protection as London. People everywhere have a right to breathe clean air,\u201d he said.Environment lawyers at ClientEarth, which has defeated the government three times over its air pollution plans, said \u201cpolitical leaders across the UK should take note\u201d.But James Thorton, the organisation\u2019s chief executive, said the London mayor should go further. \u201cA stronger, bigger ultra-low emission zone, brought in sooner, would be key to tackling the illegal and harmful levels of air pollution found across the whole of Greater London,\u201d he said.The charge in the central London zone and extended area will operate all day, every day. Drivers within the expanded zone using \u201cnon-compliant\u201d vehicles will pay a daily charge of \u00a312.50.Khan will also tighten standards for the most polluting heavy vehicles, including buses, coaches and lorries, which will face a daily charge of between \u00a3100- \u00a3300, across the whole of London from October 2020.Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said he \u201ccould not fault the Mayor\u2019s crusade to tackle air pollution\u201d.However he warned that there were about 1.2m non-compliant cars and vans registered in London with many will be owned by the most deprived households.\u201cOur analysis suggests that even an ambitious scrappage scheme, as yet an unfunded ask of central government, could leave many of these households out of pocket unless the Mayor puts other initiatives in place to help them.\u201dMatt Winfield, London director for the walking and cycling charity Sustrans, said the announcement was \u201ca vital step in tackling toxic traffic pollution\u201d. But he added: \u201cCleaning up vehicles will only take us part of the way toward truly clean air. We need fewer vehicles, not just cleaner ones. That\u2019s why the mayor must continue to invest in measures to prioritise walking and cycling and reduce traffic on our streets.\u201d",

He is banned from lobbying the government or using his contacts in Whitehall on behalf of Augean until September 2024.Eustice declined to answer questions on how much he would be paid for his role and what experience he would rely on in his work for Augean. He said if a financial interest did arise it would be declared through the parliamentary register.In Acoba\u2019s advice letter, neither Eustice nor the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs made any mention of the investigation by the EA, an arms-length body of Defra.The investigation resulted in Augean South, a subsidiary of Augean, paying \u00a325,000 to an environmental charity in Northamptonshire, where the company\u2019s site is located, as well as \u00a311,058.90 to cover the costs of the EA inquiry.The groundwater contamination was discovered during routine inspections by Augean in March 2020, with the agency finding the company had \u201cnegligently exceed its environmental permits\u201d.The EA investigated a discharge in 2020 that had a \u201cshort-term impact on wildlife and saw some amphibian species decline but populations recovered by the following summer\u201d.The agency said \u201cvegetation also naturally improved after the pollution\u201d, and it was satisfied that Augean had taken appropriate action to resolve the situation.Eustice told Acoba that a meeting, held in April 2023, with one of the partners of a private equity firm that is a shareholder in Augean had led to the job offer being made.Augean said neither it nor the private equity firm had any contact with Eustice before the conclusion of the agency\u2019s undertaking.Defra told Acoba the department had no \u201cspecific dealings\u201d with Augean, but transparency records show other ministers had three roundtable meetings with the company in 2016 and 2017.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The flight, partly funded by the UK government, flew to great fanfare from airlines and ministers as a potentially guilt-free way to fly. However, scientists and environmental groups are more sceptical.The climate charity Possible and the law firm Leigh Day have filed formal complaints against the two major airlines over their claims about reducing emissions from flights.The senior campaigner at Possible, Alethea Warrington, said: \u201cThe reality is that technologies for cleaner flight either don\u2019t work, or don\u2019t even exist yet. We think that airlines\u2019 misleading claims about their emissions are unfair on people who want to do the right thing when they travel. It\u2019s time for airlines to start being honest about their sky-high emissions.\u201dCan UK\u2019s \u2018jet zero\u2019 hopes take off with a plane fuelled by used cooking oil?Read moreThe complaints, filed under the National Contact point mechanism run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), set out that both airlines are misleading consumers over their claims on reducing carbon emissions from flights as the layperson does not have the expertise to discern the limits of decarbonisation technology.Airlines claim they can use biofuels made from crops or green hydrogen made from renewable energy, but recent research from the Royal Society has found the UK would have to devote half its farmland or more than double its total renewable electricity supply to make enough aviation fuel to meet its ambitions for net zero flying.The filing highlights that BA claims to be \u201cdriving urgent action towards net-zero emissions\u201d and that it says it has a \u201cclear roadmap to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050\u201d. However, analysis has found BA\u2019s emissions from jet fuel have increased year-on-year between 2016 and 2019.Virgin Atlantic features its \u201cmission to net zero\u201d on its promotional materials but fails to mention it is falling short of its emissions targets, which Possible has argued is crucial information for consumers.The charity also points out scientific literature comparing the lifecycle emissions from biofuels with conventional jet fuel, \u201cwhich is clear that these fuels may produce even more emissions and be worse for the climate than kerosene\u201d. Both feedstocks produce fuels with similar tailpipe emissions to kerosene, and the emissions reductions are claimed to be created at a systemic level.\u201cFor fuels derived from biomass, land is not available to produce crops for biofuels in sufficient quantities to power aviation without causing hugely damaging deforestation, which increase emissions and makes biofuels just as bad for the climate as kerosene, if not worse,\u201d the charity said.A British Airways spokesperson said: \u201cIn 2019, we committed to net-zero emissions by 2050 and, while there is no single solution to this challenge, as part of our BA Better World programme, we have a clear roadmap of initiatives to get there.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It brings into sharp focus the breadth of flame retardant pollution and dangers it poses.The paper\u2019s lead author, Lydia Jahl, said she expected to find widespread contamination, but was \u201cstill blown away by the sheer number of studies finding harmful levels of all sorts of flame retardants everywhere\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking that human advancement doesn\u2019t take health impacts into account for ourselves and for wildlife,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people who pollute are not the most impacted \u2013 it\u2019s fenceline communities, turtles, dolphins, foxes and butterflies.\u201dSeveral chemical classes are utilized as flame retardants and in an effort to help reduce fire risks are added to thousands of consumer products from furniture to electronics to auto interiors.The paper found high levels of phased-out flame retardants like PCBs and PBDEs, as well as allegedly safe, newer replacements chemicals, such as chlorinated paraffins and organophosphates, across the globe. All are thought to be toxic and various compounds are linked to liver, thyroid and kidney cancers, while others harm IQ, attention and memory in children.Many of the same health problems found in humans also affect animals, Jahl said.\u201cThis is a really unfortunate side-effect from something that is supposed to protect us from fires,\u201d she added.Most flame retardants are highly persistent in the environment and can take decades to degrade. Because of their resilience, they can accumulate in animals, and as larger predators eat smaller organisms, the chemicals accumulate in higher quantities further up the food chain.The highest levels have been found in large marine mammals and birds of prey, and the chemicals are suspected of decimating killer whales\u2019 population because they do so much harm to the species\u2019 calves and immune systems. Some research predicts the chemicals could wipe out half the world\u2019s killer whale population.The chemicals were found at extremely high levels in black-spotted frogs living near electronic-waste facilities in China, and appear to be shrinking the animals\u2019 livers and harming their eggs.Flame retardants are also highly mobile and travel long distances through water and air. Research found high levels in chimpanzees in a protected Ugandan national park deep in Africa\u2019s interior, far from a flame retardant production or disposal site.The issue is all the more frustrating to environmental health advocates because flame retardants have generally been found to be ineffective in most applications, and are based on 1970s standards. There was little data on the chemicals\u2019 effectiveness and toxicity at the time, Jahl said, and the requirements were put in place when more flammable materials were used, and more people smoked.Some states and countries have started eliminating or revising flammability standards, and ending unnecessary uses of flame retardants. Once in the environment, the chemicals are extremely difficult to clean up because they are widespread in the soil, air, water and most human and animal blood.Though the standards \u201cmay seem protective at first glance, many cause widespread and lasting harm for no real benefit\u201d, Jahl said.\u201cIn general these are outdated standards that don\u2019t have data behind them, but lead to pervasive flame retardant usage, and that\u2019s how it gets into animals worldwide,\u201d she added.",

These twin interests took him from secretary to the Committee of 100, an anti-nuclear group, and private secretary to the philosopher and peace activist Bertrand Russell in 1960, to a career in environmental journalism and policy advice. He worked on various publications including the Countryman and New Scientist, and for the International Institute for Environment and Development.In 1986 he co-founded and became director of the London-based Panos Institute, with the aim of providing well-researched information on issues affecting developing countries.

They are also intentionally added to some products, or discharged in industrial effluent. Tires are thought to be among the main sources, as are plastic beads used in personal care products. Recent research has found them to be widely accumulating across the globe \u2013 as much as 10m tons are estimated to end up in the oceans annually.Humans and animals ingest or inhale large amounts of microplastics, which have been detected in human lungs, brains, hearts, blood, placentas, and feces. Their toxicity is still being studied, but new research that exposed mice to microplastic points to health issues, like behavioral changes, and other studies have found links to cancer and irritable bowel syndrome.Waseda researchers gathered samples at altitudes ranging between 1,300-3,776 meters, which revealed nine types of polymers, like polyurethane, and one type of rubber. The cloud\u2019s mist contained about 6.7 to 13.9 pieces of microplastics per litre, and among them was a large volume of \u201cwater loving\u201d plastic bits, which suggests the pollution \u201cplays a key role in rapid cloud formation, which may eventually affect the overall climate\u201d, the authors wrote in a press release.That is potentially a problem because microplastics degrade much faster when exposed to ultraviolet light in the upper atmosphere, and give off greenhouse gasses as they do. A high concentration of these microplastics in clouds in sensitive polar regions could throw off the ecological balance, the authors wrote.The findings highlight how microplastics are highly mobile and can travel long distances through the air and environment. Previous research has found the material in rain, and the study\u2019s authors say the main source of airborne plastics may be seaspray, or aerosols, that are released when waves crash or ocean bubbles burst. Dust kicked up by cars on roads is another potential source, the authors wrote.",

But Cael\u2019s team pored over 20 years of observations by Nasa\u2019s Modis-Aqua satellite, an exhaustive data repository, and looked for patterns of change in the ocean\u2019s hue through a fuller colour spectrum including red and blue.Plankton of different sizes scatter light differently, and plankton with different pigments absorb light differently. Examining changes in colour can give scientists a clearer picture of changes in plankton populations around the globe. Phytoplankton is crucial to ocean ecosystems because it is at the base of most of its food chains.When comparing these changes in colour with those hypothesised from a computer model simulating what the oceans would look like if human-caused global heating had never taken place, the change was clear.\u201cWe do have changes in the colour that are significantly emerging in almost all of the ocean of the tropics or subtropics,\u201d said Cael.The changes have been detected over 56% of the world\u2019s oceans \u2013 an area greater than all of the land on Earth.In most areas there\u2019s a clear \u201cgreening effect\u201d, Cael said, but he added that there are also places where red or blue colourings are rising or falling.\u201cThese are not ultra, massive ecosystem-destroying changes, they may be subtle,\u201d said Cael. \u201cBut this gives us an additional piece of evidence that human activity is likely affecting large parts of the global biosphere in a way that we haven\u2019t been able to understand.\u201dAlthough this discovery firmly documents another consequence of a changing climate, what is not yet clear is how strong these changes are and what is happening inside the ocean to cause them, according to Michael J Behrenfeld, a researcher of ocean productivity at Oregon State University, who was not involved in the research.\u201cMost likely, the measured trends are associated with multiple factors changing in parallel,\u201d said Behrenfeld. For instance, the potentially increasing abundance of microplastics in the ocean, which like any other particles increase light scattering.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

A group of young people are working on one of the many vegetable and fruit terraces, their laughter mixing with the sound of water in the riverbed below. I tell myself that one day I will be back. But for now, it is goodbye. I\u2019m leaving the eco-village in southern Spain, this cluster of old, whitewashed houses set in a green valley where I\u2019ve spent the past six years.My partner and I first arrived in Los Molinos \u2013 in Almer\u00eda province, the driest part of Spain \u2013 in 2006, after a long spell in north London. Our experience of eco-living was limited to regular recycling and buying biodegradable laundry and bathroom products. In Spain, we had to learn how to live completely off-grid. All our electricity came from the array of solar panels in the garden, which meant we couldn\u2019t have energy-hungry devices such as toasters and electric kettles. We even had to forgo the internet because there was no connection.The solar panels in the gardenThe water that supplied our house was drawn from a stream by means of a solar-powered electric pump. We had to navigate the outside compost loo, making sure that we directed our urine into a trough, away from the chamber for solid waste; the combination of the two would produce an almighty stink. We learned Spanish, harvested olives, grapes and pomegranates, and grew a whole variety of vegetables. And in many ways it was paradise. The sun shone most of the year. The other villagers had fascinating life experiences and there was a great sense of community. I made friends with a wide range of people from around the world, the kind of people I would never have met in my north London bubble.And yet after six years, we knew it was time to leave. Our parents, back in the UK, were getting older and would need support. As a writer I could work anywhere \u2013 indeed, while in the eco-village I finished a crime novel and wrote two biographies \u2013 but my partner, Marcus, felt he needed to return to Britain to continue his work as a journalist.When we came back the contrast between the clear, bright blue skies of Andaluc\u00eda and the seemingly ubiquitous blanket of grey cloud that covered England was a shock. Almost immediately, we missed the easy charms of Spanish living: the cheap wine and the delicious tapas that would accompany each glass; the wild landscape with its vast empty spaces that seemed to stretch for ever.The experience of eco-living was not wasted, however. I drew on those six years living in Spain for my new psychological thriller, Murder Grove, written under the pseudonym EV Adamson. It\u2019s about a young couple, Mia and Rich, who leave London to live in an eco-village where their green dream turns into a nightmare.At 35, I found out I had gout. Imagine having to give up everything you like to eat and drink | Daniel LavelleRead moreThe experience proved inspirational in other ways, too. While living in Los Molinos, we learned how to make cheap, nutritious vegetarian dishes. We coped without central heating, and survived the harsh winter nights \u2013 when temperatures can drop below zero \u2013 by stuffing the bed with multiple hot-water bottles and wearing bobble hats. When the sun didn\u2019t shine we had so little electricity that sometimes we\u2019d have to read by candlelight. As the cost of living continues to rise, I\u2019ll be able to draw on these experiences. I like to think we brought a little bit of Spain back with us. We paid for the passage of our four rescue cats, one of whom we still have. Each time I look at this ginger tom \u2013 occasionally addressing him in Spanish \u2013 I\u2019m reminded of my time in that eco-paradise and the lessons it taught me.\nAndrew Wilson is the author of Alexander McQueen: Blood Beneath the Skin, and (under the pseudonym of EV Adamson) Murder Grove\n\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Japanese winery tries to shake off negative imageRead moreTsunami waves crashed into Fukushima Daiichi, knocking out its backup electricity supply, triggering meltdowns in three of its reactors and sending large quantities of radiation into the atmosphere in the most serious nuclear accident since Chornobyl a quarter of a century earlier.The wastewater in Fukushima is being stored in more than 1,000 tanks that officials say need to be removed so the plant can be decommissioned \u2013 a process expected to take 30 to 40 years.Japan\u2019s foreign ministry said in July that regulators had deemed it safe to release the water, which will be gradually discharged into the Pacific ocean via a tunnel after being treated and diluted.The plan\u2019s operator, Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), has said its water treatment technology \u2013 known as Alps \u2013 can remove all radioactive materials from water except tritium, which it says is harmless in small amounts.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also pointed out that nuclear plants around the world use a similar process to dispose of wastewater containing low-level concentrations of tritium and other radionuclides.South Korea and China have voiced concern about the discharge, while the Pacific Islands Forum said recently it had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the proposed release.Writing in the Guardian, the forum\u2019s secretary general, Henry Puna, said Japan \u201cshould hold off on any such release until we are certain about the implications of this proposal on the environment and on human health, especially recognising that the majority of our Pacific peoples are coastal peoples, and that the ocean continues to be an integral part of their subsistence living\u201d.\u2018A form of self-destruction\u2019: Japan weighs up plan to expand nuclear powerRead moreThe South Korean government, which has yet to lift its ban on Fukushima seafood, has said that releasing the water would pose a \u201cgrave threat\u201d to marine life.

Notably, \u201cthe frequency and severity of wildfires [is] increasing with climate change\u201d, Cotten told CBS News.He told the commission that a state recovery plan implemented in 2007, including voluntary preservation guidelines for landowners intended to protect ponderosa pine and Douglas fir trees that the squirrels prefer, had failed to arrest the species\u2019 decline, or dissuade development.\u201cOn their own, they\u2019re not doing the job we hoped they\u2019d do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still seeing habitat loss at 20%, even with these actions.\u201dMelanie Rowland, another commissioner, said successive studies had shown squirrel numbers plummeting as more trees were felled.\u201cThere\u2019s no good news in that at all. It\u2019s pretty clear a lot of their habitat has been cut down,\u201d she said.The vote to uplist western gray squirrels to the endangered list followed a public consultation period. The \u201cvast majority\u201d of more than 900 comments received supported the move, Cotten said, but a case of mistaken identity probably accounted for those who opposed the adoption of greater protections and heavier fines for those who kill or molest them.The western gray squirrel is largely identical to the ubiquitous eastern gray species that some consider a nuisance. Cotten believes many residents were confusing the two.\u201cIt\u2019s not always clear if they\u2019re advocating for the right squirrel or not,\u201d he said. \u201cContinued confusion on squirrel identification and awareness of the western gray squirrel in Washington state made interpreting community comments challenging.\u201dMeanwhile, the commission is pressing ahead with a public consultation period for several other species on the state\u2019s endangered and protected species lists, including the yellow-billed cuckoo, tufted puffin, Columbian sharp-tailed grouse, Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit, grizzly bear and Oregon silver-spot butterfly.",

There is a worldwide web of wise Anansi stories, too, which became an oral tradition of the Ashanti people and have been spun over and again, their morals tangled inside the scheming hero\u2019s spirited adventures.Justin Audibert, the Unicorn\u2019s new artistic director, retells three of them in a production for three- to seven-year-olds that is direct and effervescent. But it\u2019s almost more striking to note what it is not. This is children\u2019s theatre that is never over-egged or over-insistent. There are no winking asides to adults, no spoonfeeding the meaning to kids. Nothing feels superfluous. Each bit of interplay with the audience feels just right.The children sit safe in the shadow of Sadeysa Greenaway-Bailey\u2019s set, with its tree trunks of bundled bamboo \u2013 several bearing instruments \u2013 and a canopy resembling upturned umbrellas. In contrast to the often male tone of the stories in which Anansi is father to six sons, the show is performed by a trio of women, each playing the webspinner in turn and bringing out different aspects of his character as well as portraying a supporting cast of goats, antelopes and a party-loving armadillo.In the first tale, Afia Abusham is a cranky Anansi who gathers up paper pieces of \u201cwisdom\u201d that have been dispersed among the crowd. Inveigling a young audience to part with their treasure is a test of persuasion for any performer and Abusham achieves it with charm. The tale ends with that cliche of children\u2019s theatre, the shower of confetti \u2013 but the message makes the effect beautiful.Next, Sapphire Joy plays a chillaxing Anansi, too lazy to help plant vegetables but greedy enough to lure fellow animals to a grisly death \u2013 and almost a child or two from the front row. In the final story, Juliet Okotie is a vain, rapacious Anansi, attempting to get everything but ending up with nothing. Jointly celebrating teamwork, each tale has a distinct flavour, with the middle one offering genuine suspense and bite. They\u2019re interspersed with musical interludes that use minimal props to atmospheric effect, with blue silks becoming a rippling ocean.At the end, one child immediately turns to his neighbour and retells his favourite bit of the story. And so Anansi keeps spinning.\nAt the Unicorn, London, until 27 October.\n",

        "text": "When vegetable shortages hit supermarkets earlier this month, I was probably less concerned than most salad lovers. I\u2019ve been an urban gardener for seven years, growing my own food in an 8x5m space in London. It all began for me as a tribute to my grandfather, who taught me everything I know about gardening and the living soil around us: how to use every part of the fruit and vegetables I grow; the importance of micro-organisms; using organic practices to nurture plants and protect Mother Earth.Now, I\u2019m on a mission to help other people to grow their own food, to recreate the missing link with nature and to reduce their impact on the environment. I want to empower people with the knowledge to start their own supply of homegrown food, in order to stop relying completely on big corporations and start being more self-sufficient. You don\u2019t need any specific skills to do this: by following some easy and basic steps you will be able to grow your own organic food at home.Supermarkets sell grow-at-home lettuce plants that stay fresh for longer. But what about one that grows back after you cut it, meaning you won\u2019t have to buy it again for months? You can spend what you save on new plants, as once you start you will be hooked. The more that plants enter my living space, the happier I feel.Direct sowing is one of the easiest and cheapest ways to start growing. It just means that you sow seeds directly in the area where you want your plant to be, rather than starting them indoors and moving them out, or starting them in trays and transplanting.Micro salad seedling plugs. Photograph: Tim Gainey/AlamyYou will need to sow at just the right time, which is when the last frost has passed and the soil is warm enough to welcome new seeds. As a rule of thumb, you can start sowing a few hardy varieties outdoors three to four weeks after the last wave of frost \u2013 things such as beetroots, turnips, radishes, parsnips, broccoli and a few varieties of leafy lettuce. Check online to find out when the last frost will be, or visit your local nursery and ask people working there, but be aware that this won\u2019t take into consideration your own particular microclimate, or variations due to climate changes.Lettuce grown at home is perfect for beginners: it\u2019s packed full of flavour, easy and gives quick results. All it wants is direct sun and shelter from the wind. Sow seeds directly into the ground, grow-bag or pots in direct sunlight, keeping the soil moist. You will want to grow a few plants at a time in succession, so you have a continuous supply. Early and late sown seeds may need to be protected from frost. You can do this with a fleece, cloches or a plastic tunnel.Sow seeds in rows about 30cm apart, with about 1cm of soil over them, and water generously. As the seeds start to germinate and grow, thin them out by picking out the weaklings, until you have strong plants about 30cm apart. Harvest when the lettuce looks like it\u2019s worth eating. Use a sharp knife to cut it away from the stem close to the ground.A quarter of British shoppers struggle as grocery prices soarRead moreIf you only have a small space, for instance your balcony, think about what is likely to thrive there. Vines such as tomatoes, peas and green beans are great for vertical spaces such as balustrades and trellises. If you have room for larger pots, try bushy vegetables such as courgettes and peppers, or small fruit trees. You can buy these grafted on root stocks that restrict their growth, so they won\u2019t grow too big for your space.One great advantage of growing in small spaces is that you can use the shade to your advantage. If you grow cucumbers vertically up a trellis, like I have, you can move your pots around on hot summer days so your lettuces can follow their shade. This is a bit like people sitting around the pool on holiday, chasing the sun or the shade as the sun moves.Many gardeners struggle with growing lettuce in the middle of summer; sitting in direct sunlight causes it to bolt and go into flower. Thanks to your small space, you can succeed with plants that people with larger gardens will struggle to grow. You just have to be mindful of how the sun moves.

        "text": "South-eastern Australia faces possible gas supply gaps for at least the next four years during bouts of extreme weather, potentially requiring exports to be diverted south, according to the gas outlook from the Australian Energy Market Operator.Aemo\u2019s gas statement of opportunities report found that gas output in New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania would meet demand until 2027. But customers could face shortfalls, particularly if cold weather coincided with low levels of renewable energy generation.\u201cThe risk of gas shortfalls each year from winter 2023 to 2026 in all southern jurisdictions remains under extreme weather conditions and periods of high gas-powered electricity generation, with those risks further exacerbated if gas storage levels are insufficient,\u201d said Aemo\u2019s chief executive, Daniel Westerman.Most Australian states face sharp power bill rises, despite government\u2019s interventionRead more\u201cWhile production capacity commitments have increased for 2023 compared to the 2022 GSOO and several key infrastructure projects are on track for delivery, there is forecast to be a 16% reduction in production capacity this winter compared to 2022 in Victoria, which increases supply pressure in the southern regions,\u201d he said.Although Australia is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of gas, most of the supply in the eastern states is earmarked for export.

Although gas is generally declining as a fuel for power generation, its high cost relative to historical levels and limited availability can trigger electricity price spikes as happened last year.The impact of the suspension contributed to rises in the proposed default market offers for the coming year of up to a third, regulators reported on Wednesday.Gas demand is forecast to peak more often during winter than summer when there is less solar power and \u201cwind droughts\u201d can set in.

Lead author, Dr Eleanor Tew, head of forest planning at Forestry England and visiting researcher at the University of Cambridge, described the finding as \u201csobering and alarming\u201d.Many of the threats warned of by researchers are already affecting forests and woodlands. The fungal disease ash dieback will kill up to eight out of 10 of the UK\u2019s ash trees. In 2021, winter storms destroyed about 12,000 hectares (30,000 acres) of forest in Britain. Climate projections show storms, heatwaves, droughts and floods are likely to become more common and more severe.\u201cThe problem comes when you get all of those things happening at the same time as multiple, interrelated threats,\u201d said Tew. \u201cThat just overwhelms the forest, and you basically get trees dying and the forest ecosystem collapsing \u2026 that has massive landscape impacts, and significant impacts for society.\u201dA wildfire on the Clwydian Range moorland in Llangollen, Wales, June 2021. Photograph: Getty ImagesCatastrophic ecosystem collapse is not inevitable, and is not yet occurring in the UK\u2019s forests. \u201cWe do have time to make a difference, and there is a lot we can do to make our forests more resilient,\u201d said Tew, who described the paper as a \u201ccall for action\u201d.Solutions include increasing the diversity of tree species within a wood, planting trees of different ages, promoting natural regeneration and managing deer populations. People can help by using the online Tree Alert tool to report possible tree pests and diseases. Tew also said people should make sure their boots are clean before walking in a new woodland to avoid spreading disease.The long-term impacts of forest ecosystem collapse would include loss of timber, carbon sequestration, poorer air quality, water retention and human enjoyment. In some parts of Europe, there has already been ecosystem collapse within forests: storms, drought and bark beetle outbreaks in Germany have destroyed the equivalent of 250,000 football fields of forest.All this is often made worse by management strategies that create forests full of the same species and age of tree, making them more vulnerable.Ash trees with ash dieback are felled in Gloucestershire, England. The disease has killed up to eight out of 10 of the UK\u2019s ash trees. Photograph: Nick Upton/AlamyThe forestry industry has to plan in advance, Tew said: an average conifer in a plantation can take up to 60 years to reach maturity, and a broadleaf up to 150 years. \u201cForestry has always been about planning for the long-term, and we\u2019re at a time of huge change,\u201d said Tew.The government plans to plant 30,000 hectares of forest every year by 2025, which is double current planting rates.

If the trends continue, the heat could become too much for the sensitive amphibians to survive successfully, researchers have said.The call of the coqu\u00ed frog is well known to most who have spent time in Puerto Rico.

While recording the sounds along the slopes of El Yunque mountain in Puerto Rico, he and his team found that the calls changed depending on the altitude of the frogs.Amphibians are very sensitive to changes in temperature, and the higher on the mountains they were, the cooler it was. The frogs on the mountain peaks, therefore, were found to be larger than ones sitting in warm valleys, and this meant their call was different.Nairns said: \u201cCoqu\u00ed that produced short, high-pitched calls at high rates lived near the base of the mountain, while the calls of animals living near the mountain\u2019s peak were longer, lower-pitched, and repeated less frequently.\u201dTwo decades after first recording their sound, Nairns returned to the mountains with a colleague, Sebastiaan Meenderink. The pair found that every frog call, no matter where it was on the mountain, had become higher pitched.\u201cIn order to record a call with certain characteristics we had to move to a slightly higher altitude,\u201d said Meenderink. \u201cIt was as if all the animals had moved up the mountain.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

St Mary\u2019s, built in 1784 as the penal laws began to ease, restored an important place of worship for the\u00a0indigenous population.We walk to the beach that flanks the narrowing of Trawbreaga Bay into the Atlantic.

The first official data since the latest expansion showed that the number of older, more polluting vehicles in London had dropped by nearly half in a month, with an average 95% of vehicles driven in the city now compliant and not subject to a fee. Early data suggested TfL was netting \u00a31m a day in charges and fines, although the scheme was not designed to raise revenue in the long term.The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: \u201cThe decision to expand the Ulez was not something I took lightly but, when confronted by the evidence, it was clear that clean air zones like these are the most effective way to cut toxic air and meaningfully protect people\u2019s health.\u201cIn a few short years the Ulez has prevented tens of thousands of tonnes of toxic nitrogen oxide emissions from being released and the London-wide expansion is enabling 5 million more Londoners to breathe cleaner air.\u201dKhan said that non-transport sources still contributed half of the deadly emissions produced in London, and called on the government to provide the necessary funding and powers to allow the capital to tackle other sources of air pollution. Domestic and industrial gas combustion create much of the NOx pollution, while wood-burning stoves and commercial cooking are significant contributors to particulate pollution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Enforcement cameras have been vandalised and earlier this month, the Metropolitan police arrested two men for blowing up a camera in Sidcup, south-east London.The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, formally announced this month that he would not be pursuing a similar clean air zone, saying investment in cleaner buses and taxis would drive down pollution \u201cwithout causing hardship\u201d.",

Guardian Australia did not attend the meeting, but Dwyer said attenders \u201casked questions around the water and air sampling programs and the interpretation of their existing results\u201d.\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nFree water testing has been offered to owners and occupiers of land in the Cadia Valley, the EPA said, but it added that local councils are responsible for managing water treatment of mains water, and tank water is the responsibility of private residents.\u201cThe purpose of this testing is to determine the presence of any metal contamination, as part of our broader monitoring program,\u201d a NSW EPA spokesperson said. \u201cWe will be taking water samples from household kitchen taps, tank taps and sludge from tanks on residential properties which are rainwater dependent.\u201dIt follows five rounds of water testing in an independent laboratory as part of a citizen survey, organised and led by the Cadia Community Sustainability Network. In March NSW Health and Newcrest also conducted their own testing.An estimated 1,000 people live within the 15km radius of the mine, and rely on rainwater for drinking. At this stage there is no confirmation that the heavy metal contamination has come from dust plumes attributed to the mine, and tracing the source of the contaminants will form part of the EPA investigation.Stuart Riles, who lives less than 10km from the mine near Forest Reefs, got his blood tested after the first community meeting and said the results were in \u201cnormal range\u201d.NSW EPA launches investigation into Cadia goldmine after blood tests show metal contaminationRead more\u201cBeing in normal range while some of my near neighbours are not \u2013 I put that down to keeping my gutters clean and having a divert/first flush system [for rainwater tanks] in place for years,\u201d he said.Riles is now planning to don a wetsuit to \u201cde-sludge\u201d the bottom of his rainwater tank. He will then refill one-third of the tank with bore water and reconnect his gutters, which he disconnected after attending that first meeting in May.Newcrest said it has commissioned a health risk assessment by an external environmental expert and undertaken independent lead isotope testing and a dust fingerprinting study, both of which are nearing completion and will help to identify the source of any lead contamination reported in household water tests.\u201cWe have been cooperating with the EPA and already have work in progress to ensure that we comply with the EPA\u2019s Prevention Notice,\u201d a Newcrest spokesperson said.Newcrest was made aware that local residents have recently undertaken blood testing but has not received a formal notification from NSW Health of any results containing elevated heavy metal levels.\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community\n",

        "text": "With its dramatic leaves and sprawling structure, the giant rhubarb has long been a popular garden plant, gracing the grounds of stately homes and multiple National Trust properties.But the UK government is now to enact a ban \u2013 similar to that on Japanese knotweed \u2013 on the plant, also known as Gunnera, meaning it cannot be sold or cultivated, and those who have it in their gardens must ensure it does not spread.It has long been believed that the giant Gunnera plants in Britain are one of two species, Gunnera manicata or Gunnera tinctoria. The former is a benign and beautiful plant originating in Brazil and Chile, while the latter is highly invasive, spreading rapidly and choking native flora. It has been illegal to sell or cultivate G tinctoria since 2017, while G manicata (or plants believed to be G manicata) has been widely available and celebrated for its exotic look.Now a study by the Royal Horticultural Society, which involved molecular and morphological analyses, as well as a historical investigation, has revealed that G manicata appears to have been lost from cultivation not long after it was introduced. In its place, the researchers found a hybrid between G manicata and G tinctoria, which has been named Gunnera \u00d7 cryptica.This species has been found to be similarly invasive to G tinctoria and will now be banned. There are fears the widespread nature of this plant will cause problems, such as those caused by G tinctoria, where it has spread in wetter areas such a the west coast of Ireland and Scotland. It has been listed as a \u201cspecies of union concern\u201d under an EU regulation, and is now listed as being of \u201cspecial concern\u201d in the UK.There are collections of Gunnera across the UK and it is widely planted in gardens, so the RHS anticipates significant implications for the horticultural industry.New advice from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has said the hybrid should be treated as a banned species, so the RHS is changing its advice to gardeners about G manicata plants, which are almost certain to be the invasive hybrid, removing them from shops, and identifying any of the hybrid plants in its gardens.While some may be removed from RHS gardens, if any plants are retained there will be prominent signage with of the plants and advising gardeners not to plant it in their gardens. Defra says any existing plants may be retained but Gunnera \u00d7 cryptica must not be newly planted or cultivated.In drier areas, the moisture-loving plant needs a lot of watering, and this falls under the definition of cultivating, so many of the plants across the country will have to be allowed to die out.The RHS say that if gardeners do want to remove it, it can be cut back and treated with herbicide or dug out completely. Alternatively, an easy way to stop it from spreading is to cut flower heads each summer before they set seed, then compost with care. The flower spikes can be cut close to their base with a gardening knife or pruning saw in July or August.John David, head of horticultural taxonomy at the RHS, said: \u201cWhen we began our research we were using Gunnera to look at the difficulties in differentiating between an invasive species and its non-invasive close relatives. It was therefore a surprise to find that a plant that has been a firm favourite in our gardens for its impressive size and exotic appearance, turned out to be an undetected hybrid.\u201cThis would not have been possible without the help of botanists in Brazil and Chile, where these plants originate, as well as many others who provided material that enabled us to prove the disappearance of one species and the discovery of the new hybrid.\u201dThe research was published in the journal Sibbaldia.",

There she became the UCLA\u2019s first female physics instructor, described in the newspapers as a \u201c25-year-old striking blue-eyed blonde\u201d.Returning to her native England, she taught at Chelsea College of Science and Technology (now part of King\u2019s College London), where she met her husband, Heinz Post, who set up a department for the history of the philosophy of science. The couple married in 1961, after which Janet moved to the Sir John Cass College (now part of London Metropolitan University) in Aldgate, where she is remembered as a first-class physics lecturer with an ability to engage with and inspire students.In 1973 Janet and Heinz had a holiday cottage built in Switzerland, where they would go for summer holidays and winter skiing, as well as visiting friends in Europe.Janet was also a successful textbook author. In 1979, Heinz took a sabbatical year, which the couple spent in the US. Janet used the time to write Energy: A Guidebook. It was ahead of its time in including three chapters on renewable energy. Published by Oxford University Press in 1983, it sold more than 23,000 copies.In the 1990s she used her skills at the Open University (OU) to help a team including myself to create a resource pack for university lecturers to teach renewable energy. She contributed chapters to the successful OU textbooks Renewable Energy (1996) and Energy Systems and Sustainability (2003). She was particularly skilful at devising the student questions and answers, and the exam papers. She would work with papers piled on the grand piano in the living room, surrounded by hundreds of \u201chistorical\u201d science books (a few written in Latin).Born in the Isle of Wight, she was the daughter of Jane and George Ramage, who ran Pollard and Ramage, a popular chemist\u2019s business. At the local grammar school, Janet, firmly supported by her mother, insisted on being allowed to specialise in science (not the done thing for girls at the time). She went on to study physics at the Royal Holloway College (now Royal Holloway, University of London), followed by a PhD in crystallography at the University of London, which she completed in 1956.Janet continued working for the OU until she was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 2014.Heinz died in 2004.

        "text": "Hoarding during the Covid-19 pandemic underlined just how important loo roll is to the British public. But working from home had another unexpected effect: less waste paper from offices, which means less recycled material to make toilet roll.New research by Ethical Consumer magazine shows that the three main toilet brands have cut the amount of recycled paper in their tissues. It said the use of virgin wood pulp was fuelling deforestation, although paper-industry advocates dispute this.The consumer organisation recommended that people avoid buying Andrex, Velvet, Cushelle, Regina and Nicky because more material used to make them is taken from felled trees.It found that Kimberly-Clark, which makes Andrex, cut the amount of recycled fibre it uses for tissue and personalcare products to 19.3% in 2021, down from 29.7% in 2011.It used less fibre, down from 3.53m tonnes to 2.85m, but almost all the reduction was in recycled fibres, while virgin-pulp use fell only slightly.Sofidel, maker of Regina and Nicky, cut recycled fibres from 8.9% in 2019 to 7.3% in 2021.And Essity, which makes Velvet and Cushelle, cut the amount of recycled paper in its products from 2.1m tonnes in 2018 (40%) to 1.9m tonnes in 2022 (36%) while it increased slightly the amount of fibre taken from pulp.Shanta Bhavnani, a researcher at Ethical Consumer and the author of the report, said: \u201cThere\u2019s so much awareness now of the importance of trees in addressing climate change so it\u2019s really disappointing to see the big toilet paper companies cutting their use of recycled fibres.\u201cBut it\u2019s encouraging to see the growth in the number of alternative toilet paper products, as it means consumers now have many more sustainable options.\u201dShe cited a report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a US environmental body, that said logging in the northern hemisphere was having an impact on Canada\u2019s boreal forests, with 11.3m hectares (28m acres) of forest felled from 1996 to 2015 \u2013 almost the size of England.Recycling is more efficient than cutting down trees as it produces less wastewater and other waste and requires less energy, according to the Environmental Paper Network, a global coalition of more than 150 civil society organisations, which also says that making tissue from recycled paper uses one-third of the greenhouse gas emissions of virgin wood.However, Two Sides, a membership organisation for forestry, pulp and other paper manufacturers, said that it was misleading to say paper production contributed to deforestation since \u201call trees used for making paper products are replanted\u201d.It said European forests had grown from 2005 to 2015 and 74% of all paper used in Europe was recycled.It added that virgin pulp was required to maintain the recycling chain, as fibres degrade over time, so that paper can be recycled 3.8 times on average, though others say fibres can last up to six times or more.All three companies named in the report take virgin wood from certified schemes like the Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC). But Ethical Consumer said these schemes had previously suffered from poor oversight and labels such as \u201cFSC mix\u201d were from forests that were not audited.It recommended that people buy toilet roll made from recycled paper or sustainably sourced bamboo pulp with no plastic packaging.Gareth Lucy, Essity UK\u2019s communications director, said that he was disappointed by the report because there had been a big drop in the availability of waste paper during the pandemic \u2013 \u201cfrom the huge reduction in office paper waste as workplaces were closed, and the transition of household bills and documents from paper to online\u201d.He added that Essity had been researching how to make tissue from other sources such as wheat straw. \u201cEssity has identified and developed ways to process new sources of recycled paper, such as from used paper towels and takeaway coffee cups, and has invested in a new state-of-the-art recycled paper facility that can process a lower grade of recycle fibre.\u201dA Kimberly-Clark spokesperson said it was aiming to end the use of natural forest fibre by 2030 and that its UK operation uses 77% fast-growing, farmed eucalyptus fibres.\u201cOf the remaining 23%, we\u2019re working towards reducing them further through the use of innovative technology, for example using enzymes to give the tissue paper the necessary strength\u201d the spokesperson said.Sofidel was contacted but declined to comment.",

Gore spoke amid growing alarm among Democrats and campaigners that the Willow development will drastically undermine the US\u2019s effort to confront the climate crisis.Texas youth organizers take aim at the biggest oil field in the USRead moreThe vast, multi-billion-dollar ConocoPhillips oil project, to be situated on the tundra of Alaska\u2019s northern Arctic coast, is awaiting approval from the federal government that could arrive as soon as Friday. Gore, the former US vice-president and leading climate advocate, told the Guardian that the planned drilling would threaten local communities as well as the task of curbing dangerous global heating.\u201cThe proposed expansion of oil and gas drilling in Alaska is recklessly irresponsible,\u201d Gore said. \u201cThe pollution it would generate will not only put Alaska native and other local communities at risk, it is incompatible with the ambition we need to achieve a net zero future.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to prop up the fossil fuel industry with new, multi-year projects that are a recipe for climate chaos,\u201d Gore added. \u201cInstead, we must end the expansion of oil, gas and coal and embrace the abundant climate solutions at our fingertips.\u201dThe Willow project has become a leading target for climate campaigners due to the huge volume of planet-heating emissions it could unleash. The drilling operation would extract up to 180,0000 barrels of oil a day, about 1.6% of total US oil production from one site alone. In a grim irony, ConocoPhillips has said it may have to re-freeze ground that is rapidly thawing as the Arctic heats up in order to stabilize the drilling equipment.An exploratory drilling camp at the site of the Willow project on Alaska\u2019s North Slope is seen in 2019. Photograph: APThis drilling would result in 278m tons of greenhouse gases over a 30-year lifespan of the development, according to the administration\u2019s own estimates, the equivalent of adding 2m gasoline-consuming cars onto the road or running more than 70 coal-fired power plants for a year. The pollution produced would comfortably wipe out the emissions saved from all renewable energy projects on US public lands by 2030.The Department of the Interior has said it has \u201csubstantial concerns\u201d about the Willow project\u2019s impact upon the climate and the subsistence lifestyle of native Alaskan communities but has completed an environmental review of the development that it said would improve it, such as drilling at three sites rather than five and reducing the number of roads and other infrastructure that would be built in the wilderness.The prospect of the administration approving a full or abridged version of the project has sparked alarm among local communities, climate campaigners and Biden\u2019s Democratic allies.The International Energy Agency has said no new fossil fuel infrastructure can be built if the world is to avoid disastrous climate change and two dozen Democrats in Congress have written to Biden warning that Willow poses \u201ca significant threat to US progress on climate issues\u201d. The lawmakers called upon the president to \u201cstop this ill-conceived and misguided project\u201d.People protest against the Willow project near the White House on 3 March. Photograph: Bryan Olin Dozier/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockA wave of opposition to the Willow project has hit the White House in recent weeks, including in-person rallies in Washington DC and a viral #StopWillow campaign on social media. An online petition calling for the project to be halted has garnered more than 3m signatures. Critics have pointed out the project fatally undermines Biden\u2019s promise to deal with the climate crisis, which he has called an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to humanity.\u201cPresident Biden continues to address climate change during high-profile speeches and events but his actions are contradictory,\u201d said Siqiniq Maupin, executive director of the Sovereign I\u00f1upiat for a Living Arctic, an Indigenous group that has warned the project would endanger the subsistence lifestyle of native communities that rely upon the migration of a caribou herd, as well as other established patterns in the environment, to live in their Arctic surrounds.Biden has come under pressure from proponents of the project, too, with Alaskan lawmakers and some native groups arguing Willow would create much-needed jobs and investment for the region. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican senator from Alaska, has called the size of the project \u201cminuscule\u201d and that it has been \u201cmeticulously planned\u201d to avoid harm to the environment.The battle over Willow is likely to end up in the courts, with environmental advocates vowing to keep fighting any iteration of the project. \u201cI think that litigation is very likely,\u201d said Jeremy Lieb, a senior attorney for Earthjustice. \u201cWe and our clients don\u2019t see any acceptable version of this project.\u201d",

        "text": "Water samples taken from the bottom of 10 rainwater tanks near the Cadia Hill goldmine showed lead levels above the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines, despite samples taken from household taps or the upper levels of the tanks remaining within guideline levels, a parliamentary inquiry has heard.The samples were collected by Dr Ian Wright, an academic at Western Sydney University who is a member of the expert panel advising the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (EPA) in its investigation of the central-west mine. Last month, the regulator began legal proceedings against operator Newcrest, alleging the mine had breached clean air regulations.Wright told a NSW upper house inquiry into the current and potential impacts of gold, silver, lead and zinc mining on human and environmental health on Monday that he believed the water sampling methods used by regulators this year to check residential rainwater supplies were \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d.Cadia goldmine: EPA begins court proceedings over alleged breach of clean air regulationsRead moreHe conducted a previous tank sampling program for the Cadia Community Sustainability Network (CCSN), which reported in March that a third of the samples were above the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines for lead, which is 10 micrograms per litre.Testing of residential rainwater tanks has since been carried out by the EPA, NSW Health, and by an independent company on behalf of Newcrest. The NSW Health samples, taken from kitchen taps, were all within guideline levels. Tap samples taken by the EPA and by ALS on behalf of Newcrest reported some results outside guideline levels, and EPA samples from the top of tanks found 14 tanks with elevated levels of lead.Wright told the inquiry that he took 30 water samples from 10 residential properties near the goldmine, with the aid of CCSN, on 30 and 31 August, collecting from the kitchen tap, the top of the tank, and the bottom of the tank. Samples from the tap and the top of the tank were within guideline levels.From the bottom of the tank, \u201call 10 samples received results showing lead at concentrations above the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines,\u201d Wright said. \u201cOne tank sample exceeded the guideline by 6.6 times, one by 110 times and one by 140 times.\u201d\nSign up to receive Guardian Australia\u2019s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter\nWright told the inquiry that the sampling conducted by NSW Health and EPA did not \u201cadequately document the contaminants deep in the water tanks\u201d and was \u201cnot fit for purpose and underestimated the health risks for users\u201d.\u201cContaminated water in deep sections of tanks is a major risk as this is where water is extracted from,\u201d he said, adding that the risk increased as tanks dried out.Wright also told the inquiry that he \u201cstrongly suspect(s) that metal-enriched dust from the Cadia mine is falling out on to roofs and then is washed into water tanks\u201d.CCSN chair Gem Greentold the inquiry that they had been lodging complaints with regulators over \u201cexcessive\u201d dust from the mine for more than 10 years.EPA chief executive officer, Tony Chappel told the inquiry the EPA had \u201cclearly been failing to adequately engage and communicate with the community\u201d and would continue to \u201cto build and improve\u201d its responses.Cleaning rainwater tanks could disrupt EPA investigation of Cadia goldmine, expert warnsRead moreHe said Cadia was a good example of the need for \u201ca more integrated sense of stewardship\u201d and said there had been \u201ca series of senior executive and leadership changes\u201d at the EPA to deliver that change.\u201cThe way we\u2019ve historically engaged with the community has been inadequate and probably contributes to unnecessary stress and anxiety with the community,\u201d he said.Earlier, the EPA said it has used standard sampling methods that are \u201cconsistent with the approach used in scientific literature to enable robust scientific comparison\u201d.\u201cAs well as samples taken from the tops of tanks and kitchen taps at almost 100 properties, we have collected more than 20 sludge samples where accessible from the bottom of tanks in the area,\u201d a spokesperson said.Those results are still being analysed.Newcrest\u2019s interim CEO, Sherry Duhe, and the Cadia Valley Operations general manager, Mick Dewar, also gave evidence to the inquiry on Monday. They maintained that the mine is operating in compliance with clean air regulations.Dewar told the inquiry that based off the findings from the lead isotope analysis and air monitoring of 2.5 and 10 particulate matter around the mine, the company had \u201cconcluded there was just no evidence suggesting that Cadia was actually contributing lead to those tanks\u201d.In a statement, NSW Health said it had made a submission to the inquiry, but that it did not have responsibility for approving or regulating mining or for regulating private rainwater or groundwater supplies.\nSign up for the Rural Network email newsletter\nJoin the Rural Network group on Facebook to be part of the community\n",

        "text": "Ministers should consider subsidising e-bikes as they do electric cars, campaigners have urged, after a study found that mass use of such bikes could create more than \u00a32bn in health benefits and cut a million tonnes of emissions annually.While grants of up to \u00a31,500 are available for low-emission cars, vans and motorbikes, there is no such assistance for electric-assist bikes, which help propel riders up to a maximum powered speed of 15mph when the bike is being pedalled.According to an evidence review by academics at Westminster University, commissioned by the campaign group Bike is Best, boosting e-bike use would bring other benefits not created by electric cars, including reduced road congestion and fewer potentially dangerous particulates from tyre and brake wear.E-bikes have become increasingly common in the UK, but sales are still well below levels seen in many other European countries, where studies have shown they are particularly popular with older riders and with women.The study included polling that shows 67% of Britons who might be interested in buying an e-bike are put off by the price. But of these, the poll said, 53% would be likely to buy one if there was a hypothetical subsidy of \u00a3250 on a \u00a31,000 model.The study used the Department for Transport\u2019s so-called propensity to cycle tool, based on detailed data about work trips and used to inform decisions on cycling schemes, to calculate that mass bike infrastructure and access to e-bikes could prompt up to 25% of commuting trips to be made by bike.Such a switch would produce overall economic health benefits in England and Wales of \u00a32.2bn a year, most of this coming from better health due to e-bike use, but also because of lower levels of staff absence through illness.While e-bikes provide less of a health benefit per mile than unpowered bikes, studies have shown that users tend to end up with similar overall levels of physical activity because e-bike riders travel longer distances on average.The latest study found that promoting e-bike use would mean a particular rise among people who live in more rural or hilly areas.Both the \u00a32.2bn health dividend and the estimated saving of a million tonnes a year in carbon emissions are based just on commuting, as that is the data on which the propensity to cycle tool is based. The overall savings could thus be significantly greater, the authors said. The statistics are for England and Wales only, as they are the source of the propensity to cycle data.While fully electric cars produce no carbon emissions while in motion, the million-tonne saving was calculated from the lower power requirement to recharge an e-bike \u2013 studies have put this at 2% of what is needed for an electric car \u2013 and substantially lower emissions associated with their construction.As well as commuting, the study notes, the development of e-cargo bikes could create even more emissions reductions through urban freight use, a significant contributor to road transport emissions. Studies have suggested e-cargo bikes could replace up to a quarter of all so-called last mile deliveries currently done using vans. Consumer models can be used to carry children and heavy shopping.Scott Purchas, of Bike is Best, said the UK risked lagging behind other European countries on e-bike use. \u201cThe future is electric but not in the way people might think. All of the focus for subsidies has been for electric cars, but this new report demonstrates the substantial benefits of electric bikes and how essential they are for rapidly decarbonising transport, improving our health and cleaning up the air at the same time,\u201d he said.A Department for Transport spokesperson said the government was investing \u00a32bn in cycling and walking, and that e-bikes for commuting were already subsidised under the tax-saving Cycle to Work scheme.",

The capacity to be curious about mental processes \u2013 while simultaneously experiencing them \u2013 is an important one for an author seeking to describe the human condition. But anyone who values self-awareness will be used to noticing how their mind works and wondering why.\u201cOnly connect\u201d was the maxim of another famous novelist, EM Forster. Forster used the characters in his novels to put flesh on his arguments against the emotionally repressive code of the time. But McEwan\u2019s recommendation to disconnect should not be understood as a repudiation of Forster\u2019s humanism. He was not warning writers off paying attention to other people\u2019s minds and ideas \u2013 but drawing attention to the need to spend time with our own. In a world of permanent connection, in which attention has been commodified, switching off and away from the outside world is arguably harder than ever before.Many of us are so attached to our phones and other devices that even a temporary separation provokes anxiety (though less so for those whose jobs are not screen-based, and whose communications are arguably better balanced as a result). The Guardian\u2019s new series Reclaim Your Brain is a response to the growing frustration that many feel at the hold that smartphones have on our minds and happiness, and explores ways of resetting that relationship.But tuning out, whether for two hours or two weeks, is not only about defying the masters of the digital universe \u2013 or turning back the clock to a time before news was 24/7 and phones were video cameras. What is turned towards also counts. The long evenings of January, with a new year stretching ahead of us, can be a good time for introspection as well as the self-improvement that traditionally takes the form of resolutions such as diets and exercise plans.John Keats set out his theory of \u201cnegative capability\u201d in a letter written in the middle of winter, after an evening walk with a friend. We cannot say whether the shortness of the day inspired the direction that the poet\u2019s thoughts took that evening in 1817. But the state of not knowing that Keats believed artists should aspire to \u2013 the ability to be \u201cin uncertainties, Mysteries and doubts without any irritable reaching after fact or reason\u201d \u2013 seems more fitted to gloomy candlelight than blazing sunshine.Doing nothing can be boring. Being alone can be miserable. Far too many people in the UK this winter are experiencing severe material or social deprivation. To those whose lives are otherwise full \u2013 of activities, appointments, responsibilities, pleasures \u2013 a few weeks\u2019 hibernation may be welcome. For many others, it is a more stimulating life, rather than a quieter, more secluded one, that is desired.But for others, this time of year is valuable for the sense of slowing down it brings; the chance to take stock either on one\u2019s own or through talking with others. Looking ahead is one aspect of this. Another is looking back and inward; or not looking at all, but being in the moment with our hopes, mysteries and doubts.",

Despite their protests, legal battles and even threats to kill themselves en masse, the group has been unable to prevent oil and gas exploitation in what they say is their sacred land.U\u2019wa leaders say the Colombian government has permitted the construction of gas stations in their reserve without consulting them as well as oil pipelines which are frequently sabotaged by armed rebels, sending the tar-black liquid spilling into the local rivers and streams.The U\u2019wa have been under threat since the Spanish conquest and are recognised by the constitutional court of Columbia as being \u201cat risk of physical and/or cultural extermination\u201d due to the country\u2019s armed conflict.As well as imperiling their existence, the oil and gas projects violate the group\u2019s core belief that nature is sacred and that an equilibrium between the earth, water, oil, mountains and sky must be maintained.\u201cOil is the blood of Mother Earth and helps keep the balance of nature,\u201d Javier Villamizar Corona, a member of the U\u2019wa community and legal representative, said. \u201cTo exploit oil is to violate the fundamental principles of nature.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "A quarter of European ski resorts will have scarce snow every other year with 2C of global heating, a comprehensive analysis has found. It calls into question whether such resorts have a future as the climate crisis intensifies.The study took into account artificial snowmaking, without which half the resorts would have scarce snow every other year at 2C. Current action and policies mean the world is on track for 2.7C of global heating.The researchers also examined the impact of ski tourism on the climate and found artificial snowmaking contributed just 2% of overall emissions. Tourist flights to resorts and accommodation were the main causes of emissions.In stark contrast: the warming of Europe\u2019s ski resorts \u2013 photo essayRead moreArtificial snowmaking in some resorts in the Alps, Nordic countries and Turkey could compensate for snow shortfalls as the climate heats, the study found. But snowmaking is unlikely to help in resorts in Britain and southern Europe, where it will frequently become too warm to create snow in the first place, or the snow that can be made will melt very quickly.The $30bn (\u00a323.8bn) European ski industry hosts 80% of the world\u2019s resorts, with more than a million day visits a year. The most recent ski season was a poor one, with record-breaking warm winter weather closing ski slopes from Chamonix in France to Innsbruck in Austria.Dr Samuel Morin, research scientist at M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France and CNRS in Toulouse and Grenoble, said: \u201cSki tourism is a niche issue in the face of climate change, but from the point of view of the people who live in the mountains and make a living from the industry, it is very important to really understand to what extent climate change is threatening the activity, and to take into account the impact this activity has on the climate.\u201dProf Paul Peeters at Breda University in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cThe study delivers detailed input for policymakers, investors and the tourism sector, encouraging them to reconsider whether it is wise to maintain high dependency on winter tourism in certain areas.\u201dThe study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, used data and models to assess snow cover at 2,234 resorts from Iceland to Turkey under 2C and 4C of warming. In the extreme case of 4C, almost three-quarters of resorts would have scarce snow every other year even with snowmaking.Scarce snow was defined as the poorest coverage seen on average every five years between 1961 and 1990. The researchers assumed artificial snow was used to cover 50% of a resort\u2019s ski runs, which is not unusual in resorts.The researchers did not publish data for each resort in the study as local factors affect their viability, such as the availability of other tourist activities such as hiking trails.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

        "text": "Fossil fuels benefited from record subsidies of $13m (\u00a310.3m) a minute in 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund, despite being the primary cause of the climate crisis.The IMF analysis found the total subsidies for oil, gas and coal in 2022 were $7tn (\u00a35.5tn). That is equivalent to 7% of global GDP and almost double what the world spends on education. Countries have pledged to phase out subsidies for years to ensure the price of fossil fuels reflects their true environmental costs, but have achieved little to date.Explicit subsidies, which cut the price of fuels for consumers, doubled in 2022 as countries responded to the higher energy prices resulting from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Rich households benefited far more from these than poor ones, the IMF said. Implicit subsidies, which represent the \u201cenormous\u201d costs of the damage caused by fossil fuels through climate change and air pollution, made up 80% of the total.Ending the subsidies should be the centrepiece of climate action, the IMF said, and would put the world on track to restrict global heating to below 2C, as well as preventing 1.6 million air pollution deaths a year and increasing government revenues by trillions of dollars. The researchers acknowledged that subsidy reform was politically difficult, but said carefully designed policies that supported poorer households could work, especially if coordinated internationally.The IMF\u2019s findings come as the climate crisis wreaks havoc across the world, from heatwaves, wildfires and floods from the Americas to Europe to Asia.Cutting fossil fuel subsidies \u201cneeds to be the centrepiece of efforts over the next few years to get on track with limiting global warming to below 2C\u201d, said Ian Parry of the IMF. \u201cIdeally this is done through carbon pricing [and] some of the revenues from reforms should be used to compensate poor and vulnerable households.\u201cWe are in this situation because it can be very difficult to increase taxes on fossil fuels, not least when countries are acting unilaterally,\u201d he said. \u201cWe recommend that large emitting countries coordinate on carbon pricing or similar policies to help scale up global action.\u201dIpek Gen\u00e7s\u00fc, a subsidies expert at the ODI thinktank, said: \u201cThe IMF report shows that, at a time when the world is starting to experience worsening impacts of climate change, governments continue to pour fuel on to the fire by providing record levels of subsidies for fossil fuels.\u201cIf we are to have any chance of avoiding irreversible and tragic consequences of climate change, governments simply have to show bolder leadership, by phasing out their support for production and consumption of fossil fuels.\u201dThe G20 nations, which cause 80% of global carbon emissions, pledged to phase out \u201cinefficient\u201d fossil fuel subsidies in 2009. However, the G20 poured a record $1.4tn (\u00a31.1tn) into fossil fuel subsidies in 2022, according an estimate by the International Institute for Sustainable Development thinktank. The World Bank reported in June that fossil fuel and agricultural subsidies combined could amount to $12tn (\u00a39.5tn) a year and were causing \u201cenvironmental havoc\u201d.Canada recently announced plans to end some fossil fuel subsidies. Nigeria, which had been spending four times more on petrol subsidies than on healthcare, removed them in May. However, past subsidy removals often have been reversed after protests.The IMF analysis found petrol and other oil products accounted for half of explicit subsidies in 2022, with coal accounting for 30% and fossil gas 20%. The biggest subsidisers of fossil fuels were China, the US, Russia, the EU and India. Coal was particularly heavily subsidised, with 80% of it sold at less than half its true cost.The researchers said the estimate of the total fossil fuel subsidies in 2022 would have been much higher \u2013 about $12tn \u2013 if they had used higher climate damage costs that were recently published.The analysis calculated that ending fossil fuel subsidies would cut emissions by 34% by 2030 compared with 2019 levels, representing a large chunk of the 43% cut needed to have a good chance of keeping global heating below 1.5C.The researchers said that for subsidy reform policies to avoid political backlash and be successful they needed to be phased in gradually, provide financial support to those on low incomes and use the increased revenues productively.The World Bank report said: \u201cAlthough [cutting subsidies] will entail demanding policy reforms, the costs of inaction will be far higher.\u201d",

But adding multiple layers, with intermingled planting, helps to mimic what one may find in a biodiverse forest, with each layer giving benefits for wildlife.\u201cThere\u2019s a school of thought, or a concept, called a forest garden or a food forest,\u201d said Massey, \u201cand essentially it\u2019s mimicking a natural forest. So you\u2019ve got the canopy layer of the trees, you\u2019ve got the climbing plants that scramble up the trees and climb on fences. You\u2019ve then got the shrub layer, ground cover layer, you have mushrooms, you have this swale feature which holds water, and then you\u2019ve got roots.\u201cSo it\u2019s a kind of multilayer garden with high degrees of biodiversity, intermingled planting, so rather than just having a block of shrubs, it\u2019s got lots of different species growing harmoniously together.\u201dTom Massey suggests adding about 30 plant species, from poppies to grasses to trees to climbing plants. Photograph: Random HouseMassey, who has displayed multiple times at Chelsea flower show, is launching a book with the Royal Horticultural Society about how to turn sterile, paved front gardens and heavily mown back gardens into havens for wildlife through planting forest gardens.Forest gardens have plant types of varying heights and are a good use for small plots because you are gardening from high areas to low. They support more wildlife as there are varying habitats and the planting is dense.An example front garden Massey suggests is a low-maintenance gravel garden with plants that are resistant to drought and wind, as front gardens are often more exposed to the elements, with lower-quality soil. Suggested plants include the small-flowered hesperaloe, a yucca-like perennial with pink flowers, and autumn sage, a bushy dwarf shrub with red, purple or yellow flowers. Both are drought-resistant, low-effort and attractive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This prompted the climate change minister, Chris Bowen, to say the opposition\u2019s crusade for a nuclear option was not viable.O\u2019Brien has long championed nuclear as a solution to Australia\u2019s emissions reduction energy transition, despite the prohibitive costs and the Coalition government he belonged to showing no serious appetite to embrace nuclear while in power.Solar and on-shore wind provide cheapest electricity and nuclear most expensive, CSIRO analysis showsRead moreIn response to the latest report, O\u2019Brien said it examined costs through an investment lens, rather than a consumer lens.Investment costs are passed on to consumers in order for investors to recoup and profit from their investment. The report deliberately examines technology costs, which is one of the main drivers of energy investment, to help guide both government and private investors spending in the Australian energy market.\u201cIf an energy plan is to reduce household energy prices it must put consumers at the centre, not investors,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\u201cBut Labor ignores this distinction and instead weaponises GenCost by deliberately misrepresenting the report and assuring Australians its \u2018renewables only\u2019 policy is reducing power prices.\u201cLabor points to GenCost to argue that renewables are the cheapest form of energy, but they fail to finish the sentence \u2013 renewables may be the cheapest form of energy for investors, but not for consumers.\u201d\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nBowen said the report, which is used to help give guidance to both government and investors about the cheapest forms of energy, vindicated Labor\u2019s energy transition policies.\u201cThe draft report today makes it crystal\u2011clear, the cheapest form of energy is renewable energy,\u201d he said.\u201cRenewable energy is cheaper than coal, cheaper than gas, much, much, much cheaper than nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is the most expensive form of energy available.\u201dThe report authors looked to the one feasible nuclear small reactor project in the world, the Carbon Free Power Project in the US, to draw it\u2019s cost and timing conclusions.The company had projected costs of A$18,200/kW in 2020 which jumped to A$31,100/kW in 2022 as a result of global inflation. With cheaper energy options, CFPP had trouble securing energy provision contracts and the project was cancelled in November this year. The project had previously been hailed by O\u2019Brien as evidence of a \u201cburgeoning\u201d global nuclear industry.By comparison, the GenCost report found that under existing policies, the cost of a new offshore windfarm would be between $5,545/kW to $6,856/kW (fixed to floating) while rooftop solar in 2023 cost $1,505/kW.Bowen said the opposition needed to question whether it would continue \u201cwith their ideological fact\u2011free attraction to nuclear energy\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Morning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But do leaders have the will to act? | Adam MortonRead more\u201cNuclear energy is a fantasy wrapped up in a pipe dream for Australia,\u201d he said.\u201cIt also is not available by 2030, so if the opposition thinks it\u2019s going to play a role in Australia in meeting 2030 targets, they are engaging in a fantasy.\u201dThe report found that if Australia did decide to make a nuclear small modular reactor as part of its energy mix, it would take until at least 2038 to be fully operational in a best-case scenario based on the deployment timing of the cancelled US project.It also found that renewable energy would probably be at least three times cheaper than nuclear energy by that date.O\u2019Brien argued the government should adopt \u201can all of the above approach to technology\u201d and that the Coalition would continue to push for a serious exploration of nuclear.Technology cost for renewables is expected to continue to decrease over the next six years to 2030, although it found that almost all energy technology capital costs increased over the last year due to inflation.Capital costs for onshore windfarms and solar farms both increased by 8%, batteries increased by 2% and gas turbines increased by 14%.Fossil fuels were more complicated, given their reliance on long-term energy provision contracts and growing investor reluctance because of climate policy risks.The report will remain open for consultation for six weeks.",

It was dismissed as \u201cprofoundly silly\u201d, \u201ca ludicrous popcorn thriller\u201d informed by \u201clousy science\u201d, and some scientists argued it depicted meteorological phenomena \u201cas occurring over days, instead of decades or centuries\u201d.Storm Elliott, the \u201cbomb cyclone\u201d that hit the US over the holidays, should have made some of those critics uncomfortable. Temperatures in places plunged in just a few minutes as one of the greatest North American storms ever recorded swept down from the Arctic to Mexico, sometimes at hurricane speed. It brought death, chaos and misery for tens of millions of people.Fierce Christmas storms and bomb cyclones are not that unusual in the US but Elliott was remarkable chiefly for its continental scale, lightning speed and intensity. Scientists have yet to calculate the degree to which it might be linked to human actions and increased CO2 levels, but it clearly fits the IPCC\u2019s widely predicted pattern of climate intensification and unprecedented global heat, cold and atmospheric turbulence.Less noticed than Storm Elliott but possibly just as significant were the disastrous Christmas floods in the Philippines and Brazil, and the worryingly warm holiday period experienced across much of Europe in the past 10 days. Temperatures of more than 26C were recorded in France, Spain and Italy, with many Alpine ski resorts closed for lack of snow as rain fell and temperatures climbed 15C above normal. Traditionally, it\u2019s Australians who spend Christmas on the beach. Soon it might be anyone.00:01:48The footage that captures how dangerously cold it is in the US right now \u2013 video reportThe cyclone bomb rounded off a year that rewrote climate history. It was not just one of the hottest years on record, but also one of the driest in many countries, with nearly every week bringing some new climate-related disaster. Starting with Storm Eunice in February, which battered northern Europe, immense floods, droughts and storms hit Pakistan, India, China, Australia, southern Africa and the US. Crops failed in unprecedented heatwaves and hundreds of thousands of people were made homeless in both rich and poor countries. Temperature records stretching back hundreds of years were broken in the UK, Italy, France and Spain.Next year is widely predicted by meteorologists to bring more of the same intensification of weather. The Met Office says 2022 will be the newest warmest year on record. Greenland\u2019s glaciers have been found to be melting far faster than previously thought, heatwaves are becoming more common and storms are expected to become more powerful as the oceans continue to warm.But while 2022 may have been the year that more people than ever experienced what used to be termed \u201cfreak\u201d weather, it was yet another year lost when it comes to governments acting. What Storm Elliott and all the droughts, floods and extreme climate events show is that we are physically, mentally and financially unprepared for what is certain to come. Christian Aid this week estimated that 2022\u2019s 10 worst climate disasters alone cost more than $165bn, but that is likely to be nothing if action to adapt our infrastructure and economies is not taken urgently.The Guardian view on the climate crisis: no end in sight | EditorialRead moreEven as Storm Elliott devastated parts of the US, it must have occurred to many governments in the rich northern hemisphere that the climate crisis is helping to supercharge the weather and that something similar or worse could just as easily happen in their countries.But the rich world has utterly failed to adapt to the changes taking place, and it will now cost far more than it need have done. Only a handful of countries \u2013 mostly those on the frontline of climate chaos like Bangladesh \u2013 have even begun to try to adapt to the approaching chaos and tragedy. Cop27 in Egypt may have finally launched a global loss and damage fund to help poor nations adapt, but no money has been pledged and, judging from experience, is likely to come soon.All we know is that major adverse weather events such as Elliott are likely to grow in number, scale and frequency. That means big decisions must be taken now on how to adapt our investments, housing, farming, food, transport, health and energy systems.Governments cannot avoid the climate crisis any longer. We must become accustomed to this new reality and be prepared. We have no choice now; everything must change.\nJohn Vidal was the Guardian\u2019s environment editor.

Native to China, they were first detected in Pennsylvania in 2014 and have since spread to at least 14 states.An adult is approximately an inch long, with black spots on its wings. Its hind legs have patches of red and black with a white band and its abdomen is yellow with black bands.Spotted lanternflies do not fly long distances. Instead, they lay mud-like egg masses on tree bark, decks, play equipment, lawnmowers, grills, and bikes and other modes of transportation, the US Department of Agriculture said.Lanternflies can lay egg masses with 30 to 50 eggs each and can severely affect the grape, orchard and logging industries, according to wildlife authorities.Without any indigenous predators, the species is so invasive authorities have long urged Americans to \u201ckill it, squash it, smash it, just get rid of it\u201d.The USDA now cautions travelers to frequently check vehicles, trailers and even clothes to avoid moving the insects from one area to another.In New York, experts are warning that residents may expect to see spotted lanternflies earlier as a result of an unusually warm spring.\u201cWith the warmer weather New York state is facing, we expect that [spotted lanternflies] may hatch earlier this year, within the next month or even sooner, in New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley,\u201d Chris Logue, director of plant industry at the New York state department of agriculture and markets, told NBC New York.One way experts advise residents to eliminate egg masses is by scraping them off hard surfaces.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianNatural England\u2019s most recent assessments, conducted earlier this year, indicated the majority of these sensitive habitats were in an \u201cunfavourable condition\u201d even before the current prolonged dry weather.One lifelong Borrowdale resident, Billy Bland, 76, told the Guardian: \u201cThis dry spell is earlier and longer than I can remember. I don\u2019t remember the beck ever being as low.\u201dWarmer water carries less oxygen, while low water levels raise the concentration of river pollutants, such as sewage and agricultural runoff. These factors \u201caffect the whole of the ecosystem from the insects that live in the water to the fish, right through to the otters and the birds\u201d, said Mackay.Mackay singled out salmon for particular concern. She said water temperatures of 22-24C were potentially fatal for the fish, already in decline nationally.Being turned into a \u2018rapid conveyor of water\u2019 has made the river less resilient to drought and flooding, says Ruth Mackay. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian\u201cWe think climate change has a lot to answer for,\u201d said Mackay, pointing to an increased frequency of extreme weather events, including droughts. But in Borrowdale, she said, the negative effects of the climate crisis were compounded by modifications to the river system, made over centuries, mostly with the aim of draining farmland.Parts of the Derwent and its tributaries now run dead straight, with the river perched on the edge of the valley. Rather than occupying its natural flood plain, Mackay said, the river had been turned into a \u201crapid conveyor of water\u201d, making it less resilient to drought and flooding.In recent years, West Cumbria Rivers Trust has been partnering with the National Trust, a major landowner in Borrowdale, to enact solutions. . Stream restoration work has taken place at Stonethwaite, towards the south end of Borrowdale, while further downriver, at Dunthwaite, new ponds have been built and black poplars, an important wetland tree that has all but disappeared from Cumbria, have been successfully introduced.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Vegan diets also cut the destruction of wildlife by 66% and water use by 54%, the study found.The heavy impact of meat and dairy on the planet is well known, and people in rich nations will have to slash their meat consumption in order to end the climate crisis. But previous studies have used model diets and average values for the impact of each food type.In contrast, the new study analysed the real diets of 55,000 people in the UK. It also used data from 38,000 farms in 119 countries to account for differences in the impact of particular foods that are produced in different ways and places. This significantly strengthens confidence in the conclusions.However, it turned out that what was eaten was far more important in terms of environmental impacts than where and how it was produced. Previous research has shown that even the lowest-impact meat \u2013 organic pork \u2013 is responsible for eight times more climate damage than the highest-impact plant, oilseed.Scientists find vital missing ingredient for healthy vegan diet \u2013 algaeRead moreThe researchers said the UK should introduce policies to help people reduce the amount of meat they eat in order to meet the nation\u2019s climate targets. Ministers have repeatedly said they will not tell people what to consume, despite the precedent of, for example, taxes on high-sugar drinks.Prof Peter Scarborough at Oxford University, who led the research, published in the journal Nature Food, said: \u201cOur dietary choices have a big impact on the planet. Cutting down the amount of meat and dairy in your diet can make a big difference to your dietary footprint.\u201dThe global food system has a huge impact on the planet, emitting a third of the total greenhouse gas emissions driving global heating. It also uses 70% of the world\u2019s freshwater and causes 80% of river and lake pollution. About 75% of the Earth\u2019s land is used by humans, largely for farming, and the destruction of forests is the major cause of the huge losses in biodiversity.Prof Neil Ward at the University of East Anglia said: \u201cThis is a significant set of findings. It scientifically reinforces the point made by the Climate Change Committee and the National Food Strategy over recent years that dietary shifts away from animal-based foods can make a major contribution to reducing the UK\u2019s environmental footprint.\u201dThe study also showed that low-meat diets \u2013 less than 50g a day \u2013 had half the impact of high-meat diets on greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution and land use. However, the differences between low-meat, pescetarian and vegetarian diets were relatively small.Prof Richard Tiffin at the University of Reading said: \u201cThis study represents the most comprehensive attempt to link food consumption data to the data on the environmental impacts of food production.\u201cEncouraging high-meat-eaters to reduce meat consumption and encouraging vegetarians to become vegans should result in lower emissions,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s hard to justify changes to the diets of moderate omnivores on the basis of these results, other than to switch to a completely vegan diet.\u201dThe researchers who conducted the new study said diets enabling global food production to be sustainable would mean people in rich nations \u201cradically\u201d reducing meat and dairy consumption.They said other ways of reducing the environmental impact of the food system, such as new technology and cutting food waste, would not be enough.The biggest difference seen in the study was for emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas produced by cattle and sheep, which were 93% lower for vegan diets compared with high-meat diets.The UK Health Alliance on Climate Change recommended in 2020 that sustainable diets should be supported by mandatory environmental labelling on foods, regulation of promotions and taxation of high-carbon foods.A government spokesperson said: \u201cPeople should make their own decisions around the food they eat. Achieving the net-zero target is a priority, and whilst food choices can have an impact on greenhouse gas emissions, well-managed livestock also provide environmental benefits such as supporting biodiversity, protecting the character of the countryside, and generating important income for rural communities.\u201dThe farming minister, Mark Spencer, said last week that he would like to see genetically modified cows that emit less methane.",

The contract to supply two HVDC converter stations, one at each end of the cable, has been awarded to GE Vernova and Mytilineos.The upgrades are expected to cost tens of billions of pounds, according to National Grid.

The next government will need to balance the strong local opposition to new grid infrastructure across rural areas of the UK against the climate and economic benefits of the work.Research undertaken by National Grid has found there will be an estimated 400,000 jobs created by 2050 due to the work needed to rewire Britain\u2019s grid, including about 150,000 jobs anticipated in Scotland and the north of England.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Plibersek is expected to make a decision on that application later this year.The Australian Conservation Foundation on Wednesday said the minister had \u201cmade the right decision\u201d on the Port of Hastings plan.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nKelly O\u2019Shanassy, chief executive of ACF, said: \u201cWe need to build renewables fast and there are going to be impacts to nature from all developments. But we need to make sure the most important areas with high conservation values are off limits to all developments, including renewables.\u201dShe said the area of Australia needed for renewables was small and vast areas had already been cleared of habitat. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to choose between nature or renewables,\u201d she said.She said Plibersek\u2019s \u201csound decision\u201d at the Port of Hastings should be followed up by a rejection of Walker Corporation\u2019s plans for Toondah Harbour.The sharp-tailed sandpiper was added to the threatened species list after several studies recorded sharp declines of the birds of between 60% and 24% over just three generations.One recent analysis suggested the numbers of the birds globally \u2013 estimated at 71,000 adults \u2013 had stabilised. They are found mostly in the south-east of the country at coastal and inland locations.Two of the migratory species \u2013 the black-tailed godwit and the common greenshank \u2013 are considered to be at higher risk of extinction, and have been listed as endangered.Other species listed as vulnerable are the ruddy turnstone, Latham\u2019s snipe, Asian dowitcher and grey plover.The threat to four further migratory species has been downgraded.The Nunivak bar-tailed godwit has been upgraded to endangered from a previous threat category of vulnerable. The Northern Siberian bar-tailed godwit was considered critically endangered, but is now endangered. The red knot and great knot are now both considered vulnerable after previously having a higher threat status. This article was amended on 10 January 2024. An earlier version incorrectly stated that the Nunivak bar-tailed godwit was critically endangered. It has been upgraded to endangered, from a previous threat category of vulnerable.",

        "text": "About 30 years too late, many might say, here comes Ofwat with details on how it will \u201ccrack down\u201d, as it puts it, on executive pay in the English water sector. Since the regulator\u2019s new powers to interfere on boardroom pay don\u2019t kick in until next year, this year\u2019s assessment can be considered an explainer on how a new offside rule will work.And the news from the video assistant referee is that Severn Trent, South West Water and Portsmouth Water committed offences that \u201cdid not meet our expectations\u201d, says Ofwat, because either short- or long-term incentives were insufficiently aligned to good outcomes for customers or the environment. Does that mean the executives would have faced the humiliation of returning their dodgy rewards?Well, no, Ofwat isn\u2019t quite saying that. The regulator\u2019s powers of intervention are limited to ensuring customers do not pay for misaligned bonuses, but it seems there\u2019s nothing to stop shareholders from picking up the tab. How the distinction would be made is unclear. But, in principle at least, it appears Ofwat could intervene to \u201cban\u201d a bonus only for the owners to say they\u2019ll pay it anyway out of their pocket by taking, say, less in dividends than they would otherwise have done.For example, Severn Trent paid \u00a3261.3m in dividends last year. Would its shareholders have been happy with \u00a3259m if the remuneration committee said it was essential that chief executive Liv Garfield got her \u00a32.3m variable pay in full? The answer, whether you like it or not, is probably \u201cyes\u201d since Severn Trent in recent years has been at, or near, the top of comparative (a crucial word in this context) tables for financial and environmental performance.The other big obstacle to serious reform can be called the bankers\u2019 bonus cap problem: Ofwat\u2019s powers cover only the variable performance-related element in pay packets, not fixed salaries. In the case of the bankers, salaries were brazenly hiked in about 2013, as everybody apart from naive EU officials predicted at the time.It would be harder for water companies to pull the same trick, but only because the outrage would be deafening. But therein lies the real reason why executives at six water companies waived their bonuses last year: with storm overflows overflowing, and the state of the waterways on the front page of newspapers, they knew public opinion would not stand more of the same given the underinvestment and dividend-extraction since privatisation. But that is a story of public pressure, not regulatory intervention, making a small difference.None of which is to say Ofwat\u2019s new interest in bonuses is pointless. It will indeed be enlightening to see remuneration committees forced to explain how performance targets can be called \u201cstretching\u201d if they merely describe a regulatory obligation. But, please, let\u2019s not call this exercise a \u201ccrackdown\u201d. It is a modest increase in regulatory scrutiny and small advance for transparency.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last week the new chair of the Environment Agency Alan Lovell, said fines of \u00a3250m for water companies who pollute were too high for the agency to issue. He said fines in the region of \u00a310-20m would be more appropriate. But he said there should be no set limit on fines imposed through the courts.The House of Lords report called for the planning process for reservoirs to be accelerated as a matter of priority, and for compulsory water metering in all households where possible.Lord Hollick, the chair of the committee, said evidence to the inquiry had come from local communities and activist groups.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Some people also believed burning wood must be better for the environment than using gas.But there have also been warnings that stoves cause significant air pollution, releasing fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 that has dire health implications. Politicians have called for their use to be urgently reviewed.If you have a stove and decide to remove it, you will need to pay someone to do it, unless you are experienced with DIY. When hiring someone, ensure that person is certified and insured, and it is safe for them to proceed.The person will have to extract the appliance from the chimney, then lift the stove out. A contractor may need to be found to take it away for you, but ensure they recycle it. If not, you can recycle it yourself by finding a metal recycling centre.Some stoves are suitable for conversion into gas or electric, where you can enjoy the warmth without the guilt of spreading dangerous particulates.Alternatively, if it is more for decoration than necessary heating, you could remove it entirely and use the space for something else.There are limits on where and how wood-burners are used in England. People in rural, more remote regions have leeway when it comes to burning wood in their homes, as they are less likely to add to existing pollution or affect a close neighbour. Many urban areas fall within a smoke control zone, which means it is an offence to allow smoke emissions from a chimney, unless using authorised fuel or an exempted appliance. There is also a limit on the amount of smoke that is permitted to be expelled from a chimney.Even in London, which has had smoke control areas for more than 60 years, wood-burning accounts for up to 31% of PM2.5, according to a study by King\u2019s College. The mayor\u2019s office said in 2017 that 7.9 million residents of the city (95% of the population) lived in places where this form of air pollution exceeded World Health Organization guidelines by at least 50%. And a dozen or more other towns and cities, including Scunthorpe, Manchester, Swansea and Gillingham, have even higher levels of pollution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

On Friday, the Met Office put 12 areas of the UK, covering England, Wales and most of Scotland, on red alert for \u201cvery high\u201d pollen levels.\u201cWe are seeing lots of high count days because the weather is very suitable for pollen emission from grasses,\u201d said Dr Beverley Adams-Groom, a senior palynologist at the University of Worcester, who leads the UK\u2019s pollen forecasting programme in association with the Met Office.Adams-Groom said pollen counts this year were roughly average, but added: \u201cThe problem for hay fever sufferers is not so much the size of the pollen count, since any amount over 50 pollen grains per cubic metre of air is problematic for the majority, it is more the perpetual onslaught of high days, due to the almost continuous good weather in many regions since the season began in late May/early June.\u201dIf the hot weather continues into next week, the grasses will become exhausted more quickly, offering some respite to those with hay fever, she said. \u201cAlready, I am seeing some evidence that this is happening, with grasses going over very quickly.\u201dTypically, the season for grass pollen, which causes most allergies, lasts from mid-May until July, while the weed pollen season generally covers the end of June to September. The Met Office pollen forecast show that some areas are getting a double hit.Hay fever symptoms include sneezing, coughing, a runny or blocked nose, as well as red, itchy or watery eyes. Sufferers can also experience headaches, earache or lose their sense of smell.Scientists predict that as global heating causes a higher frequency of hotter, drier summers and warmer wetter winters in the UK, the seasonal pollen pattern could change. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing scientific consensus that climate change will impact the pollen season in the UK. It could result in longer pollen seasons,\u201d said a Met Office spokesperson.Urban areas tend to have lower pollen counts than the countryside, but research has also shown that people in urban areas experience more severe symptoms because pollution can exacerbate the body\u2019s reaction.Graph of visits to NHS hay fever web pageProf Sheena Cruickshank, an immunologist at the University of Manchester who carried out the research, said: \u201cPollution can damage the protective barriers in our nose and respiratory tracts so we\u2019re more likely to get things in, we\u2019re seeing that pollution can have an effect on immune sensing \u2026 and it can narrow airways and make it difficult to breathe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

On the contrary, we believe that the impacts and risks are too high for this possibility to be ruled out,\u201d they write.The team say that it is unlikely that bodies contributing to light pollution \u2013 be it from ground-based LEDs or other lamps, or low-altitude satellites \u2013 will regulate themselves.\u201cEvery time some health or environmental issue arises and starts to be addressed in the scientific literature, the \u2018machine of doubt\u2019 is put into action by the polluters to stop, or at least delay by years or decades, the adoption of countermeasures and rules to protect human health and the environment,\u201d write Fabio Falchi, from the Light Pollution Science and Technology Institute in Italy, and co-authors in a comment piece.Light pollution rapidly reducing number of stars visible to naked eye, study findsRead moreAs a result, the team have called for action.\u201cIn my opinion there should be a cap limit on the total number of satellites in low orbits, and their number is probably already too high,\u201d Falchi said, with the team writing that caps should also be introduced for artificial light at night.According to an accompanying perspective piece, megaconstellations have more than doubled the number of functional satellites in low Earth orbit since early 2019, with a vast number of launches planned in the coming years.But experts say this has come at a cost: the illumination of the artificial satellites and associated space junk by the sun has increased night sky brightness.\u201cWe are witnessing a dramatic, fundamental and perhaps semi-permanent transformation of the night sky without historical precedent and with limited oversight,\u201d writes John Barentine of Dark Sky Consulting and colleagues.According the authors, one concern is that faint astrophysical signals will become increasingly hard to detect due to increasing night sky brightness.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what\u2019s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Populations of bees, spiders, ground beetles and hoverflies have disappeared twice as fast in areas intensely farmed for crops, according to the paper, which looked at citizen science data on more than 1,500 invertebrate species.Although there was a push to intensify agriculture after the second world war, since the early 90s more sustainable and wildlife-friendly farming practices have emerged, with EU agri-environment funding made available for farmers to plant hedgerows and wild flowers, alongside better regulation of pesticides. However, these have not managed to stem biodiversity loss.\u201cIn fact, for most of the taxonomic groups included in this study, declines appear to have accelerated over recent years,\u201d the researchers write in the paper Invertebrate Biodiversity Continues to Decline in Cropland, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.The study suggests that, despite having impact locally, wildlife-friendly farming measures have not been employed on a big enough scale to have an impact nationally. However, the scientists believe that post-Brexit changes to UK agricultural policy could help farming to achieve those goals.Lead researcher Francesca Mancini, from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said: \u201cThe main message to policymakers is that despite the efforts we have put in in the last 30 years, this is just not enough. We really need to review what we\u2019ve done and try to do better for the future for diversity, but also for the future of agriculture.\u201dInsects are crucial to ecosystems because they provide food for other creatures, pollinate crops and recycle nutrients.The study compared areas in Britain with high and low cropland cover and found that declines are worse in areas with high cropland cover. The researchers divided Britain into 1 sq km cells that were categorised depending on how much cropland \u2013 predominantly oilseed rape and cereals such as barley \u2013 was being grown within them. They did not look at land used to graze animals.Intensive farming provides little habitat for wildlife; insect populations declined the most in areas with high cropland cover. Photograph: Sam Hobson/WWFIn areas with more than 50% cropland cover, invertebrate species had disappeared from 5% of sites that were occupied in 1990, while in areas with less than 50% cropland cover, they had disappeared from 2% of sites.Out of the six taxonomic groups examined, spiders and bees were the most negatively affected in areas with more than 50% cropland cover, showing a 7% and 4% decline respectively. Researchers suspect declines were worse before 1990, but lack sufficient data.\u201cThey are pretty sizeable declines,\u201d said Mancini. \u201cBecause of the introduction of environment schemes and the improvement of policy and practice since the 1990s, we were hoping that we would find a slowing down or trends becoming stable. But that\u2019s not the case, and things are still declining.\u201dThe paper suggested a number of possibilities, including the general intensification of agriculture, changes to the type and efficacy of insecticides, habitat loss around cropland, and the climate crisis and other weather-related events such as drought.Healing nature will help us all.

By seasoning the chicken two to three days in advance and keeping it in the fridge uncovered, you more or less air-dry the bird, making the meat more flavourful and the skin crisper. Inspired by Victoria Glass, who makes salad dressing from the fat rendered from roast meat, I\u2019ve adapted Zuni Cafe\u2019s recipe by making my dressing mostly with the chicken dripping, rather than olive oil.If need be, ask a butcher to spatchcock the chicken for you; they may even salt it for you, if you don\u2019t fancy air-curing the bird in your fridge. When storing chicken uncovered in your fridge, of course be extra careful that it doesn\u2019t come into contact with any other foods, to avoid cross-contamination.Serves 61 small chicken (about 1\u00bdkg), spatchcocked Sea salt and black pepper300g stale bread3 tbsp olive oil35g pine nuts4 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced1 garlic clove, peeled and finely sliced35g currants or raisins45ml white- or red-wine vinegar80g mixed salad leaves, ideally some of them bitter \u2013 I used baby spinach and radicchioUsing your fingertips, loosen the skin from the breast and thighs of the chicken, generously season the bird all over with sea salt, including under the skin, then put in the fridge uncovered for 48-72 hours.Take the chicken out of the fridge two hours before you want to cook it. Heat the oven to its highest setting \u2013 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9 or higher. Tear the bread into large cubes, put these in an ovenproof frying pan with two tablespoons of olive oil, and toss to coat. Put the chicken breast side down on top of the bread, and roast for 30 minutes. Flip over the chicken, so it\u2019s now breast side up, then baste and return to the oven for 20 minutes, until the skin is crisp and the juices run clear.In a small roasting tin, toss the pine nuts, spring onions and garlic with a drizzle of olive oil, then roast alongside the chicken for the last eight minutes of cooking. Transfer the croutons to a bowl and leave the chicken in the warm pan to rest.Meanwhile, soak the currants or raisins in hot water for 10 minutes, then drain. Chop the chicken into large pieces, and set aside. Pour all the chicken fat and the cooking juices into a large bowl, whisk in the vinegar, then add the pine nut mixture and drained currants, and season to taste. Add the mixed bitter leaves and croutons, toss to coat, then transfer to a platter. Top with the roast chicken pieces and enjoy.",

        "text": "A controversial new cut in air passenger tax due next month was passed after the airline industry told the government it would lead to a new era of \u201cultra low\u201d prices for domestic flights in the UK, with one airline predicting a 31% rise in passengers, industry documents reveal.The new cut in air passenger duty (APD) for domestic flights was approved by Rishi Sunak when he was chancellor, halving the price to \u00a36.50 from 1 April. The rail industry has warned the move could increase carbon emissions by 27,000 tonnes a year and result in 220,000 fewer rail journeys a year.Industry submissions obtained under freedom of information laws by openDemocracy reveal how the airlines lobbied for the duty cut to boost air travel in the UK, despite a drive to cut carbon emissions.Ryanair in its submission to the March 2021 consultation said it would be able to offer more domestic flights at low prices, pointing out that in Spain internal flights could be booked for as little as \u20ac5 (\u00a34.42). The low-cost airline has unveiled a number of new UK domestic routes since the cut in duty was announced, including London Stansted to Cornwall.The airline also rejected a frequent flyer tax which would have progressively increased the fees for each flight taken. It argued it would be \u201clikely only to punish passengers that have an ongoing practical requirement to fly frequently\u201d.EasyJet said in its submission: \u201cOur analysis shows that if domestic APD is reduced by 50%, this would support an overall 31% increase in domestic volume, to 10.6 million passengers.\u201d BA\u2019s owner, International Airlines Group, told the Treasury that \u201cpositive outcomes could include new routes, increased frequency and larger aircraft on existing routes as well as lower fares\u201d.International flights will see an increase in duties from April. The duty for most economy long-haul flights from 2,000 to 5,500 miles will increase from \u00a384 to \u00a387. Economy flights of more than 5,500 miles will be subject to a duty of \u00a391.Sunak, who is a regular user of private flights across the country, announced the cut in APD for domestic flights in the autumn budget in October 2021. Ministers rejected a recommendation by the Climate Change Committee, the government\u2019s climate advisers, for a frequent flyer tax.The aviation industry says the cut in duties on domestic flights will boost routes that are not served by rail and help support regional economies, but environmental campaigns have criticised the move.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Headlines UKFree newsletterGet the day\u2019s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said: \u201cI\u2019ve planted a lot of jasmine. That\u2019s very, very heady. We\u2019ve also got things like evening primrose, and scented stocks because that just smells so heavenly.\u201dThe garden showcases flowering plants that produce heady scents. Photograph: Neil Hepworth/RHSHockenhull added: \u201cAll those beautiful evening scents, which we should all have in our garden space because we can get so much enjoyment out of it \u2013 and so can the moths. I\u2019ve also designed it with a lot of white flowers for that sort of night-time luminosity.\u201dAs well as beautiful late summer blooms, the garden features brambles, nettles and other plants commonly classed as weeds, because these are what moths like to lay their eggs on, and also provide food for caterpillars.Six-spot burnet moths on a thistle. Photograph: Andrew Halstead/RHSHockenhall said: \u201cThey tend to breed in our native plants, and they are more specific as to where they breed than other insects. It\u2019s so important to try to embrace the idea of wild plants in your garden. Bramble is amazing, some caterpillars love nettles, we in the gardening world need to encourage the idea of being more tolerant of these weeds.\u201dShe added that gardeners needed to be more accepting of caterpillars that may munch on their plants. \u201cWe need to encourage people to be more tolerant of a few holes here and there in the leaves of their garden plants,\u201d Hockenhull said. \u201cAfter all, it means a caterpillar has visited and that your garden is doing its job for pollinators.\u201dAs with all wildlife gardening, a diversity of habitats to appeal to different species is important, and Hockenhall has created a few of these as inspiration for visitors.She said: \u201cThere\u2019s lots of different habitats from trees to hedges to small shrubs. I\u2019ve got a little rockery area because there are some amazing plants for native moths, like heathers and grasses and mosses. We\u2019ve got a lovely perennial border that is full of vibrant colour and is full of nectar. We\u2019ve also got a moisture-retaining area for the garden, to provide a water source for wildlife.\u201dSharon Hockenhull and Georgia Tucker\u2019s RHS nocturnal pollinators experience at the RHS Tatton Park flower show. Photograph: Tim Sandall/RHSDr Hayley Jones, an entomologist at the RHS, advises members on how to optimise their gardens for insects. She said the main advice she gave people was to focus on not making their gardens too tidy. \u201cProvide spaces for hiding during the winter. So lots of moths make their pupa just under the top level of the soil or underneath leaf litter in a little crevice. The pupa are normally just very shallowly buried, so you\u2019ve got to have some hiding places for that,\u201d she said.As well as night-flowering plants such as evening primrose and nicotiana for adult moths, Jones said providing food for caterpillars was important: \u201cYou\u2019ve really got to support the caterpillar to really boost their populations.\u201d The RHS Tatton Park flower show runs from 19 to 23 July.",

He has agreed to get permission from McKinsey to share details about the companies with which he worked during his time there, said the committee chair, Pascal Canfin.At the hearing in Strasbourg, Bas Eickhout, a Green MEP from the Netherlands, asked Hoekstra how credible his proposals were in light of his past. \u201dLooking at your CV until now, you\u2019ve not really been a climate champion \u2013 and that\u2019s putting it mildly.\u201dHoekstra used the session to distance himself from the oil industry and called out its practice of downplaying climate science.In his opening speech, Hoekstra told the committee: \u201cThe fact that certain oil majors have long known of their role in climate change and sought to ignore the evidence \u2013 I find it truly unethical.\u201dHoekstra told MEPs in the environment committee he would explore a global tax on kerosene, the polluting fuel that powers planes, and promised to phase out fossil fuel subsidies.He also said he supported a target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 90% by 2040. Earlier this year, the EU\u2019s official science advisers recommended cuts of 90-95% by that date to honour its promise of limiting global heating to 1.5C this century.\u201cThe ambitious climate goals, such as phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, are clear and verifiable,\u201d said Mohammed Chahim, a Dutch MEP whose centre-left group supported Hoekstra in the committee vote. \u201cHoekstra is thus taking major steps towards green policy.\u201d\u201cBut we cannot separate his promises from his past actions,\u201d he added. He said his party would vote against Hoekstra in the European parliament on Thursday.\u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, who will supervise Hoekstra, also personally committed to the 90% target. The promise does not mean the EU is legally or politically bound to it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to This is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans \u2013 from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The EU is winding down its policy ambitions before elections in June, leaving a narrow window of time to achieve his goals.Tiemo W\u00f6lken, a German MEP with the centre-left group, said the committee\u2019s extra questions had resulted in stronger commitments from Hoekstra before the Cop28 climate summit. \u201cNow, Mr. Hoekstra needs to translate his words into action, and we will make sure he lives up to his promises.\u201d\u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d\u2019s past also came under scrutiny.

The deal comes as diplomats meet in Nairobi, Kenya, to hammer out a global treaty on plastic pollution.\u201cThe EU will finally assume responsibility for its plastic waste by banning its export to non-OECD countries,\u201d said Pernille Weiss, a Danish member of the European parliament with the centre-right EPP group, who was in charge of the proposal. \u201cOnce again, we follow our vision that waste is a resource when it is properly managed, but should not in any case be causing harm to the environment or human health.\u201dThe rules, which must be formally approved by the European Council and parliament before they come into force, set tighter controls on exports of plastic waste to rich countries and stop exports entirely to non-OECD countries. After five years, countries who then wish to import EU plastic waste can request the commission lift the ban for them if they prove they will treat it well.Most plastic thrown away in Europe gets burned, and less than a third gets recycled. Campaigners have raised concerns that some plastic waste shipped abroad for recycling ends up in landfills and waterways.Lauren Weir, a campaigner from the Environmental Investigation Agency, said: \u201cWhilst this is an improvement to current obligations, the evidence of the harms and necessity for a full plastic waste ban are clear. This is a signal that the EU is finally beginning to take responsibility for its role in the global plastic pollution emergency.\u201dThe rules mean some forms of non-plastic waste may still be shipped to non-OECD countries if they fulfil certain social and environmental criteria.The law could also lead to an increase in waste shipped to OECD countries such as Turkey.Sedat G\u00fcndo\u011fdu, a microplastics researcher at \u00c7ukurova University in Turkey, said: \u201cThe ban of plastic waste exports to non-OECD countries is a significant decision. However, it is disappointing to not see a total export ban on shipments \u2013 and not even a ban on hazardous and mixed plastic waste \u2013 to Turkey, which is both the largest importer of plastic waste in the EU and an OECD member.\u201dskip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It\u2019s thrilling to be here.\u201dRees, 67, grew up in this corner of Cardiff, just a few miles north of the city centre, and learned to sail on Llanishen but, like many, feared those days were gone for ever when plans were hatched to drain the reservoir and build houses.However, after an extraordinary 23-year fight by the community to save Llanishen and its sister reservoir, Lisvane, people were back in and on the water on Thursday ahead of a full public opening on 28 July.\u201cIt\u2019s such a precious spot,\u201d said Rees, a retired local authority worker. \u201cThe city centre\u2019s just over there but you could be in the middle of the countryside.\u201dLlanishen often benefits from a steady south-westerly breeze and the hope is to eventually set up a sailing club at the site.

The embankments of both are sites of special scientific interest due to the presence of a wide variety of grassland fungi, and Lisvane is an important wintering spot for diving ducks.In 2000, the reservoirs were acquired by Western Power Distribution, which proposed to build more than 320 houses and flats. The sailing club closed, fishing stopped and in 2010 Llanishen was drained.An action group called the Reservoir Action Group (RAG) was created in 2001, determined to protect the site, and at its height had more than 2,000 members.Jan Rees, of the Watchtower Waders swimming club, at her \u2018precious\u2019 Llanishen reservoir. Photograph: Dmitris Legakis/Athena Pictures/The GuardianIn 2016, D\u0175r Cymru (Welsh Water) stepped in, purchasing a 999-year lease for the site and began to bring the reservoirs back into use.In addition to refilling Llanishen, it has restored the woodland that borders the reservoirs. As well as swimming, people will be able to sail, kayak, canoe and paddleboard. D\u0175r Cymru, a not-for-profit company, has also built a two-storey visitor centre and restaurant with views across the reservoirs.Jack Bailey, the activity manager for the site, said he had loved hearing chatter and laughter as people took to the water again. Llanishen is not the largest body of water but often benefits from a steady south-westerly breeze and the hope is to eventually set up a new sailing club at the site. \u201cThis place has a great heritage. It will be lovely to be able to teach people to sail here again.\u201d\u201cThis is a wonderful moment for us,\u201d said Richard Cowie, the chair of RAG. \u201cAt times it seemed we were never going to win but we stuck by it.

The main driver of rising plastic consumption in sub-Saharan Africa, where 70% of the population is under 30, is demand for vehicles and other products amid rising income and population growth.Overall, plastic use worldwide is projected to almost triple by 2060.The soaring demand for plastic predicted across sub-Saharan Africa, where many countries do not have the capacity to manage it, was revealed before a meeting of governments in Nairobi, Kenya, next week to hammer out a UN treaty to fight plastic pollution.Rich Gower, senior economist at Tearfund, said: \u201cThe signs of environmental breakdown are all around us, but this treaty has the potential to curb the plastics crisis and improve the lives of billions of people.\u201cMuch of the plastic being used in sub-Saharan Africa is plastic packaging and ends up being dumped and burned,\u201d he added. He urged negotiators in Nairobi to agree to significant reductions in plastic production and to put waste pickers, who collect 60% of all plastic that gets recycled globally, front and centre of the treaty.In the absence of global rules and regulations, people living in developing countries and the waste pickers who collect the waste, disproportionately bear the brunt of the environmental and health impacts of plastic pollution.Dr Tiwonge Mzumara-Gawa, from Malawi, a waste campaigner who will be at the negotiations in Kenya, said: \u201cWhile these negotiations continue, the health of people in Malawi and across Africa is being impacted by plastic pollution every day.John Chweya, chairman of the waste pickers\u2019 association of Kenya, pushes a handcart through Kisumu.

These negotiations have shown that change is coming, but it will not come easily. There are some who profit from this plastic crisis and want to keep ambition as low as possible.\u201dAn open letter to representatives of the Africa Group and others attending the negotiation in Nairobi, signed by 80 bishops and church leaders, said the region was facing \u201cmountains\u201d of mismanaged plastic waste.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It is a breeding ground for mosquitoes, flies and vermin, increasing the risk of malaria, cholera, diarrhoeal disease and other illnesses.In May, before the last round of negotiations of the plastics treaty, John Chweya, the head of the waste pickers in Kenya, who has been instrumental in pushing countries to recognise the world\u2019s 20 million waste pickers, said he wanted justice for collectors, as well as healthcare, a proper income and better working conditions, to be included in the treaty.Tearfund\u2019s analysis is based on statistics from a database of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and is published in Global Policies Outlook.

        "text": "The UK government\u2019s decision to set catch limits for fish populations above those recommended by scientific advice is to be challenged in the courts by marine conservationists who accuse ministers of breaking their own post-Brexit rules.The legal challenge, expected to start in January, will argue that the government is \u201cillegally squandering\u201d a public asset and going against laws aimed at improving sustainable fishing.Every year, the UK, the EU and Norway negotiate catch limits for shared commercial fish species for the following year; they are advised by an independent scientific body as to what level is sustainable. This month, for the third year in a row, ministers agreed to set at least half of the catch limits for shared stocks above scientific advice. This means a green light for overfishing, according to the Blue Marine Foundation.The deal for 2024, agreed by the UK, the EU and Norway, will result in 750,000 tonnes of fishing opportunities, worth \u00a3970m for the UK fleet.Mark Spencer, the fisheries minister, said scientific advice had informed deals setting 70 catch limits for fish stocks in the North Sea and north-east Atlantic, in support of a \u201csustainable\u201d and profitable fishing sector. But conservation and environmental law NGOs have criticised ministers from all the nations involved, warning many severely depleted fish populations remain at \u201cgrave risk\u201d.Charles Clover, co-founder of Blue Marine, said: \u201cHow long is the British public, the fishing industry or the Treasury meant to tolerate Defra ministers routinely, blithely and disingenuously breaking their own post-Brexit laws? Who is going to challenge them? Someone should and we are prepared to do so in the national interest.\u201dBlue Marine has written to ministers saying it will be seeking leave for judicial review of its determination of fishing opportunities for 2024, if these are in line with the government announcement on 8 December 2023.When the government introduced the Fisheries Act, the first domestic fisheries legislation in four decades, it said it would create a \u201cworld class\u201d management regime drawing on \u201cbest available science\u201d to ensure fish populations are healthy and sustainable.The reality is different, say conservationists. In the first year post Brexit, more than 65% of catch limits were in excess of independent scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (Ices). In the second year, they were 57% above.This year a \u201cprovisional estimate\u201d by Defra has found the same number of jointly managed stocks has been set in line with or lower than scientific advice as last year \u2013 the third since the new regime came into place. Among the allocations were opportunities on stocks that scientists do not think should be fished at all, including two new at-risk species, Channel and Celtic Seas pollack and Irish sea sole.Too little, too late: the desperate search for cod babiesRead moreLast year the charity ClientEarth took EU ministers to court over the 2022 catch limits in the north-east Atlantic for shared fish populations between the EU and the UK as well as stocks in EU waters. The case is still pending.A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cSustainability has been at the heart of the UK\u2019s approach to support the viability of the UK fishing industry and catch limits have been set in line with obligations under the Fisheries Act 2020 and the Joint Fisheries Statement.\u201cDuring these negotiations we pushed for decisions to be based on the best available science to protect key stocks using evidence from Ices as the starting point.\u201dA European Commission spokesperson said it was important to reach \u201cbalanced and responsible\u201d agreement and that scientific advice had been taken into account, alongside socioeconomic and other evidence, to justify catch levels \u201cstrictly limited to cover the needs of fisheries to continue operating at all\u201d.",

        "text": "Technologies to clean up traffic exhaust emissions may not be effective for some types of particle pollution, a study has found.If you stand at the edge of any major road, each cubic centimetre of air that you inhale will typically contain tens of thousands of tiny particles, far smaller than the wavelength of light. The small size of these ultrafine particles (UFPs) makes them impossible to see. They are also missed by conventional techniques that measure air pollution, they are not covered by the UK\u2019s air pollution laws and the new study suggests they are evading systems installed in even the most modern vehicles.The researchers from the University of Birmingham analysed more than 10 years of air pollution measurements from alongside London\u2019s busy Marylebone Road. They found some clear successes for cleanup technologies. There were big reductions in larger particles, including diesel soot, as newer vehicles with exhaust filters began to dominate. But the smaller UFPs showed no sign of improvement between 2014 and 2020.The lack of improvement in UFPs from traffic stems from a mismatch between the way vehicles are tested before they can be sold \u2013 the vehicle approval test \u2013 and their real world use.For particle pollution, the tests were designed about a decade ago to require manufacturers to fit the best cleanup technology available at the time. UFPs are difficult to measure reliably in a vehicle test laboratory since many of them only form as exhaust cools and mixes with the air. The approval system therefore excluded the smallest particles in the exhaust to get a reliable test.Prof Roy Harrison from the University of Birmingham, who led the new study, said: \u201cThe low cleanup efficiency with respect to these small exhaust particles was not a surprise, but we had to wait to get several years of good data to be sure of what was happening. The size of the effect \u2013 essentially no reduction in the smallest particles \u2013 was a surprise.\u201dWe cannot afford to ignore the UFPs. In 2021, the Dutch Health Council and the World Health Organization (WHO) highlighted the growing evidence that UFPs are damaging our health. This includes 75 studies; mostly relating to lung inflammation, blood pressure and heart problems, along with risks to foetal growth.In 2021 the WHO also defined what should be considered high concentrations of UFP. This threshold is frequently breached at Marylebone Road and in locations worldwide with a lot of diesel traffic. Sales of fossil fuel cars are likely to continue beyond 2030 and we are still waiting for mass-market alternatives to diesel power for heavier vehicles. Exposure to UFPs alongside major roads looks set to continue unless governments mandate tighter exhaust standards, until we can transition away from internal combustion engines or reduce traffic.The improvement in diesel soot particles in London was also seen throughout Europe. One example is Leipzig, Germany where there were reductions due to a combination of new vehicles and the city\u2019s low emission zone.",

        "text": "Near the end of 2022, the secretary of state for the environment, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, committed the UK to halving the impact of damaging pesticides on the nation\u2019s wildlife and flora by the year 2030. It is a laudable aspiration. Biodiversity in Britain, as across the planet, is in peril as the climate heats up, pollution causes increasing harm to the landscape and alien species spread over the countryside. Considerable care will be needed if we are to protect nature, which is vital to our health, wellbeing and survival, from continued degradation. Limiting the ecological injury of pesticides is an encouraging move.Unfortunately, Coffey\u2019s words have not been matched by action. Incredibly, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has decided to waive restrictions on the use of a class of highly dangerous powerful toxins and permit their release on crops. Neonicotinoids have been described as the Novichok of bees: a single teaspoon is sufficient to kill more than a billion, say scientists.The EU has made it plain that, because of their alarming toxicity, neonics have no role to play in modern agricultureFor this reason, the UK Expert Committee on Pesticides last week argued that requests for these toxins to be used to protect sugar beet crops against attack from aphids should be turned down. For the third year in a row, this advice was promptly rejected and their dispersal was given the go-ahead by Defra. Such sidestepping of expert advice contrasts starkly with the European Union, which has made it plain that, because of their alarming toxicity, neonics, as these chemicals are also known, have no role to play in modern agriculture. The EU has refused all requests to allow them to be sprayed on crops in Europe.The UK government\u2019s contrarian insistence on using neonics has appalled many scientists and green activists. By using a class of chemical capable of such pernicious impacts merely to protect sugar from aphid-borne disease, the government is endangering a host of other insect species, including bees and other pollinators that are crucial to the flourishing of our crops and flowers.Neonics build up in the soil, accumulate in the roots of wildflowers and collect in streams and ponds.The dangers posed by such poison reservoirs are considerable. Yet they are being taken merely to protect sugar beet supplies in the UK. And it does not inspire confidence in the government\u2019s claims to have genuine green credentials when the authorisation process is shrouded in secrecy, with no hint being given for the reasons for approving these powerful toxins. A better solution, proposed by many scientists, would be to diversify and grow other, more nutritious crops that do not bolster the nation\u2019s swelling obesity problems.At Cop15, the UN biodiversity talks in Montreal in December, the UK government called for global ambition in dealing with pesticides. Last week\u2019s decision on neonicotinoids has fallen disastrously short of its own proclamations and once again underline the gulf that lies between the green pronouncements of the current Conservative administration and the actions that it actually takes to deal with the environmental crisis that threatens to overwhelm us.This last point is crucial and should be carefully borne in mind when considering other recent government environmental pronouncements. One of the most important of these was the announcement, made this month by Coffey, of subsidy schemes that will reward farmers in England for a range of environmentally friendly actions and boosting the ecological strength of their land. These are admirable aspirations. We can only hope that these pledges have a longer shelf life than the ones about pesticides the environment secretary made last year.",

        "text": "A key plank of the UK government\u2019s defence against the biggest climate legal action in the world next week has fallen away as a result of the U-turn by the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, on green policies.The UK is one of 32 countries being taken to the European court of human rights on Wednesday by a group of Portuguese young people. They will argue in the grand chamber of the Strasbourg court that the nations\u2019 policies to tackle global heating are inadequate and in breach of their human rights obligations.In its defence to the legal action, which is the biggest climate case yet taken across the globe, the UK government argues it is taking world-beating action to tackle climate change, with a legally binding target to reach net zero by 2050.In documents submitted to the court, Kate Hughes, the director of international climate change at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, raises in evidence the government\u2019s 10-point plan for a green industrial revolution, as proof of the tough policies being taken by the UK. The plan, she said, \u201chas set out some of the concrete steps we will take to reach net zero emissions by 2050\u201d.But key policies in the plan, which was introduced by the former prime minister Boris Johnson, have now been scrapped by Sunak. These include the 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and the policy to phase out the installation of gas boilers by 2035.Lawyers representing the six young people taking the legal action are to present evidence that the current policies of the 32 countries mean the world is on track to reach 3C of global heating within their lifetimes and argue that the governments\u2019 failure to act quickly enough to reduce emissions breaches the human rights of their clients.The case will be heard on Wednesday at a full-day hearing in front of 17 judges when the removal of what is a key defence in the UK government\u2019s case could become significant.Gerry Liston, legal officer at Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), which is supporting the claimants, said: \u201cThe UK\u2019s emissions targets are already inadequate. If every country pursues the same ambition level as the UK\u2019s targets reflect, global warming would reach a catastrophic 3 degrees by the end of this century.\u201cNow is the time to be increasing ambition, not rolling back on existing commitments \u2013 especially when the Climate Change Committee has for some time now been sounding the alarm that the UK is well off course to meet its 2030 target. Rishi Sunak\u2019s announcement is not only senseless and immoral, it is also illegal.\u201dThe UK defence case against the claim argues the government is doing enough to meet its obligations. \u201cThe UK has taken wide-ranging measures to address climate change and, on any view is not in breach of its alleged obligations,\u201d the defence documents state. The government bolsters its case by reference to the views of the independent Climate Change Committee (CCC), saying it has described the UK\u2019s net zero target as \u201ca world-leading commitment, placing the UK decisively on the path to net zero by 2050 at the latest\u201d.But the retreat this week on several key policies designed to ensure the UK meets its future carbon budgets and its legal obligation to reach net zero by 2050 has brought the government into direct collision with the committee.Chris Stark, the chief executive of the CCC, said on Thursday: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to escape the idea that we\u2019ve moved backwards from where we were when we did our last assessment of progress.\u201cWe do that every single year, and we did that in June with what was the government\u2019s old programme. And in June, what we said to the government was that it didn\u2019t look like we were on track for the government\u2019s targets in 2030. Remember, these are legal goals \u2026 it looks like those goals will be even harder to hit with this softer package now around climate policy.\u201dAged from 11 to 24, the six Portuguese claimants say they were driven to act by their experiences in the wildfires that ripped through the Leiria region in 2017, killing 66 people and destroying about 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres) of forest.Crowdfunded by people around the world who have donated more than \u00a3100,000, they are seeking a binding ruling from the judges to force the countries to rapidly escalate their emissions reductions in what would be a historic milestone in climate litigation.",

More than 90% of them remain unknown to science, according to researchers at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, who have released a new estimate of fungi diversity as part of a report on the health of the world\u2019s plants and fungi, finding that there are probably about 2.5m species with only 155,000 identified so far.\u201cThis is uncharted territory,\u201d said Prof Alexandre Antonelli, director of science at RBG Kew. \u201cOver the last few years, we\u2019ve seen an increasing appreciation for the role of fungi in everything \u2026 They are sustaining our life, our vegetation, they are absolutely crucial for every single animal species.\u201cNow we have DNA analysis, we are trying to push frontiers. It\u2019s quite similar thing to explore the outer universe. Fungi are the dark matter.\u201dThe burning question about fungi: what happens to them in extreme heat?Read moreScientists\u2019 excitement at this undiscovered world was tempered by concern at the threat of extinction faced by many newly discovered species. Of the vascular plant species identified in 2020, researchers found more than 77% already met the criteria for threatened, 59% of species were likely to meet the criteria for endangered, and 24% likely to meet the criteria for critically endangered. With 350,000 species of vascular plants known to science, researchers believe about 100,000 are yet to be identified, but as many as one in three of those are likely to be threatened with extinction, the RBG Kew report estimates.The Kew scientists say all newly described species should be treated as being threatened unless it can be shown otherwise.Researchers around the world are encouraging the public to help with their identification efforts, which have been revolutionised by new DNA sequencing techniques that have found hundreds of fungi species in a single teaspoon of soil. In the Netherlands, one scheme offers the public the chance to name any new fungi species found in soil samples they send in to the laboratory.Since 2020, about 10,200 new fungi species have been formally described, but scientific advances mean that researchers are hopeful they could identify 50,000 new fungi species a year. This year, Kew researchers said they had found a new parasitic fungus that preys on trapdoor spiders in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic rainforest, similar to zombie-ant fungi, which overcome the insects and trick them into leaving their nests to go to places where they can spread their spores.Kew Gardens\u2019 Alexandre Antonelli: \u2018We may be losing species before we even notice them\u2019Read moreEster Gaya, a senior researcher at RBG Kew focused on fungi, said she was hopeful that identifying more species could lead to advances in medicine, agriculture and engineering, as well as helping better understand human diseases.\u201cDNA techniques have revolutionised fungi research, much more than plants and animals. Initially we were only looking at mushrooms and lichens,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s the gut microbiome.

New fuel efficiency standards, expected to be outlined in early 2024, are likely to further discourage the sale of higher-emitting vehicles, making electric cars more attractive.\nSign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads\nBowen, who also serves as energy minister, on Saturday praised new figures showing public EV charging locations had increased from 464 to about 800 between December 2022 and December 2023 \u2013 a jump of more than 70%.Bowen said it was a record year for installing the fast chargers and claimed more had been installed in the 18 months of Labor government than in the entirety of the former Coalition government.Bowen also pointed to 173,000 electric vehicles on Australian roads, saying two-thirds of those had come since Labor came to power.A post-servo highway? How electric vehicles are changing the Australian roadscape Read more\u201cThere\u2019s been a 70% increase in EV charging locations this year alone \u2013 helping address the needs of Aussie drivers in regional and suburban communities and reducing wait times for tens of thousands of new EV drivers,\u201d he said.The National EV Strategy, with investments from federal and state governments, plans for a further 1,000 charging locations within the next three years. It also aims to instal chargers every 150 kilometres along the national highway network.The federal government has sought to increase the uptake of electric vehicles through tax incentives and discounts. The fuel efficiency standards, expected to be outlined within months by the transport minister, Catherine King, would create a cap for emissions across a manufacturer\u2019s overall sales and incentivise carmakers to manufacture low and zero-emission vehicles.The Crunch: what Australia's love for SUVs means for emissions and safety \u2013 videoIndustry groups such as the Electric Vehicle Council have warned Australia could become \u201cthe world\u2019s dumping ground for dated, high-emission vehicles\u201d without stricter fuel standards.In August, the government revealed that the introduction of a fuel efficiency standard had been \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d supported throughout public consultation.In this month\u2019s mid-year economic update, the government tweaked the luxury car tax by tightening the definition of a fuel-efficient vehicle, reducing the maximum fuel consumption from 7 litres for every 100km, to 3.5 litres for every 100km. The measure in the Myefo documents said the change was aimed at encouraging greater take-up of more fuel-efficient vehicles.The government believes current standards encourage carmakers to sell less fuel efficient cars \u2013 which would struggle to be sold in some other countries with stricter standards \u2013 in Australia, and therefore discourage manufacturers from selling cheaper electric vehicles in Australia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Five Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

        "text": "The number of US service members who have been exposed to toxic \u201cforever chemicals\u201d is much higher than the military has claimed, a new independent analysis of Department of Defense data has found.A Pentagon report that aims to assess the scope of PFAS chemical exposure on its bases, as well as health threats posed to service members, estimated about 175,000 troops across 24 facilities had drunk contaminated water.But an analysis of the military\u2019s report by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), a non-profit that tracks PFAS pollution, found the numbers are probably much higher and could top more than 640,000 people across 116 bases, and potentially even millions of people when past service members are factored in.Moreover, the report seemed to omit health issues linked to PFAS exposure, such as kidney disease, testicular cancer and fetal effects. The overall report is \u201cfrustrating\u201d, said Scott Faber, senior vice-president of government affairs with EWG.\u201cThe Department of Defense is trying to downplay these risks rather than aggressively seeking to notify service members and clean up its legacy pollution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has long history of looking the other way when it comes to PFAS pollution.\u201dThe DoD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.PFAS are a class of about 12,000 chemicals often used to make products resist water, stain and heat. They are called forever chemicals because they do not naturally break down and persist in the environment. The chemicals are linked to cancer, liver disease, high cholesterol, thyroid disorders, birth defects and autoimmune dysfunction.PFAS are thought to be contaminating drinking water for more than 200 million people nationally, and contamination has been found in and around hundreds of DoD bases at high levels because the chemicals are the main ingredient in firefighting foam the military uses.Congress mandated the DoD report in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, but the military has not published it on the department\u2019s PFAS website, so it is unavailable to the public or service members except upon request.\u201cThat\u2019s the part that ought to bother every American,\u201d Faber said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that they purposefully underestimated how many service members were exposed \u2026 it\u2019s that they didn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201dThe DoD\u2019s analysis, dated April 2022, seemed designed to reduce the exposure estimates in several key ways, EWG noted.It only included bases where levels for two types of PFAS \u2013 PFOS and PFOA \u2013 exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s previous health advisory limit of 70 parts per trillion (ppt). But the EPA lowered that level in June to less than 1 ppt for each compound.Though the report came out about two months before the change, the military often lobbies the EPA on environmental rules, the pending change was publicly known, and the military likely rushed to get its report out ahead of the EPA\u2019s formal announcement, Faber said.\u201cThis is clearly what it appears to be,\u201d he said.The numbers also did not include four large bases \u2013 Fort Bragg, Yakima Training Center, Fort Leavenworth and Picatinny Arsenal \u2013 where levels ranged from 98 ppt to 647 ppt.The levels peaked at over 21,000 ppt at Horsham air national guard base in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania.The report also only considered military members who were on bases at the time of the analysis, meaning it is a \u201csnapshot in time\u201d. The military began using firefighting foam with PFAS over 50 years ago.\u201cThe real question is how many millions of service members drank the contaminated water over the last half century?\u201d Faber asked.The numbers would probably be higher if the military also included other kinds of PFAS. PFOA and PFOS are two of the most common, but thousands more are in commercial use, and the EPA also has health advisory limits for two other compounds.Though Congress required the DoD to include an assessment of health risks to troops, the military excluded risks for fetal and maternal health because it \u201cfocused on military members and veterans\u201d, the department wrote. EWG noted that about 13,000 service members give birth every year, and many live on DoD facilities. The military also made no mention of increased testicular and kidney cancer risks.\u201cIt\u2019s shocking and there was no explanation,\u201d Faber said.It is unclear what\u2019s next for the report. Congress has ordered the DoD to phase out firefighting foam that uses PFAS by October 2023, and develop a cleanup plan. The military already missed a deadline to submit a cleanup plan to Congress, but Faber noted it has new political leadership in place, and the Biden administration has been more serious about addressing PFAS contamination than Trump.\u201cThe next few years will be critical to resetting when it comes to the DoD addressing toxic chemicals, like PFAS,\u201d Faber said.",

As president of the Maldives, a nation of 1,138 low-lying islands south-west of India, Nasheed donned scuba gear and descended beneath the waves with 13 government ministers. The officials used waterproof pencils to sign a document urging the world to slash carbon dioxide emissions so the Maldives would not disappear beneath rising seas.The grim stakes of climate crisis for my generation are undeniable |  Maya OzbayogluRead more\u201cIf the Maldives cannot be saved today, we do not feel that there is much of a chance for the rest of the world,\u201d Nasheed told reporters.Today, Nasheed is the speaker of parliament in the Maldives and the global south\u2019s ambassador to the Cop26 climate conference. He continues to warn that anything more than 1.5C of global warming \u201cis a death sentence\u201d for his country and other low-lying regions around the world. To illustrate what the last 12 years of rising temperatures have brought, he recalls the lagoon where he held that famous underwater cabinet meeting.\u201cIf you go to the same spot [today], you will see the reef is far more dead, bleached, than it was,\u201d Nasheed said in Glasgow this week. Dead reefs lead to coastal erosion, which wipes out homes and schools and contaminates freshwater sources; the Maldives now spends 30% of its government budget adapting to climate change, including vast sums to desalinate water, he added.These are some of the human realities behind \u201closs and damage,\u201d a phrase suddenly in vogue at this week\u2019s Cop26 UN climate conference. It refers to irreversible harms that result from the higher global temperatures caused by burning fossil fuels and related human activities. The dead reefs of the Maldives, for example, will never come back to life as long as oceans are so hot \u2013 they will remain bleached for decades to come, even if countries manage to limit temperature rise to 1.5C.It\u2019s scandalous it has taken so long for global climate negotiations to acknowledge the reality of \u201closs and damage\u201d. Worse yet, even now, Cop26 proceedings are not calling on the main authors of the climate emergency \u2013 ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, and other fossil fuel companies \u2013 to pay for the immense human suffering and economic harm they have caused.\u201cThe principle is easy enough: these companies have to admit they are responsible for loss and damage, and they should pay for it,\u201d said Saleemul Huq, the director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh.The formal absence of calls for compensation from fossil fuel companies is not surprising at Cop26; a first draft of the conference\u2019s agreement did not even include the words \u201cfossil fuels\u201d (though a later draft does reference the need to phase out coal and subsidies for fossil fuels). Instead, Cop26\u2019s discussion assumes governments of wealthy countries will cover the costs. Here, too, the reasoning is straightforward: rich countries have emitted the vast majority of the gases overheating the planet, so they should pay for the resulting harm.Paying for loss and damage, however, is not a proposition most rich country governments have embraced. Scotland is a shining exception: Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, announced on Thursday that Scotland will provide \u00a33m for loss and damage, an example she urged other nations to follow. Meanwhile, rich countries are still lagging on a related obligation they have accepted: providing poorer countries $100bn a year to shift to clean energy and adapt to worsening impacts.But adaptation is distinct from loss and damage. \u201cAdaptation is what people do to protect themselves,\u201d for example, desalinating water, said Simon Anderson of the International Institute for Environment and Development. \u201cLoss and damage is what happens to people, with or without adaptation.\u201dAs the Climate Vulnerable Forum\u2019s ambassador to Cop26, Nasheed says loss and damage could determine the conference\u2019s success or failure. \u201cI call on the companies to pay for the damage that\u2019s been done, and for governments to make them pay,\u201d he said of the fossil fuel industry. \u201cUnless they do that, it will be tough to get the confidence of vulnerable countries that these talks are meaningful.\u201dIn a just world, the executives of fossil fuel companies would have to change places with people in the Maldives and experience how it feels to lose the reefs that protect their homes, schools, fresh water, and what Nasheed called \u201c2,000 years of culture\u201d. Short of that, doesn\u2019t simple morality demand that the companies pay for the massive loss and damage they have wrought?\nThis story is published as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story.

One way to attract the attention of the public and politicians is for those campaigning about this issue to remind those who are grandparents that they could well be the last generation to have grandchildren.It seems likely that our grandchildren, as well as having to face up to the cost of healthcare, housing and the threat of AI and other new technologies, will also have to think seriously about starting families when faced with a world which is burning up and getting hotter day by day.

California\u2019s Chevron had a record $36.5bn profit, while Shell announced the best results of its 115-year history, a $39.9bn surplus, and BP, another London-based firm, notched a $27.7bn profit. The French company TotalEnergies also had a record, at $36.2bn.When the 2022 results for all publicly traded oil and gas companies are tallied the total profits are expected to exceed $400bn, \u201ca number we\u2019ve never seen before, and one that was built off the backs of working families who were victimized by oil and gas executives\u2019 greed\u201d, according to Claire Moser, deputy executive director of the US activist group Climate Power.Bar chart comparing oil company profits to climate budgetsThe stratospheric profits were criticized as \u201coutrageous\u201d by Joe Biden during his State of the Union address on Tuesday. Biden said that \u201cwe\u2019re still going to need oil and gas for a while\u201d but the US president attacked companies for enriching shareholders through share buybacks rather than helping alleviate rising gasoline costs for drivers.The big five oil and gas companies have already confirmed that most of the bumper profits will be going to stock buybacks and dividends. The $200bn in combined profits equates to about five times the US\u2019s annual foreign aid budget, or about double what the world gave to Ukraine last year in military and humanitarian assistance. If the oil executives had decided to use this money to go to space, they could have left the Earth\u2019s atmosphere 3,225 times on Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX rocket, at $62m a trip.Bar chart of five oil companies profits from 2018 to 2022Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the secretary-general of the UN, was scornful of the industry in a speech on Monday, in which he expressed incredulity at the \u201cmonster profits\u201d of fossil fuel companies at a time when the world needs to be rapidly slashing its planet-heating emissions to avoid climate breakdown.\u201cIf you cannot set a credible course for net-zero [emissions], with 2025 and 2030 targets covering all your operations, you should not be in business,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cYour core product is our core problem. We need a renewables revolution, not a self-destructive fossil fuel resurgence.\u201dEven though the rollout of renewable energy such as solar and wind is gathering momentum around the world, countries are still forging ahead with numerous \u201ccarbon bomb\u201d projects that would push the world beyond agreed \u201csafe\u201d temperature limits. Last year, more than $1tn were invested in fossil fuel infrastructure and extraction worldwide.The sale of oil and gas remains so enticing that BP this week announced it is scaling back its climate ambitions, retaining its fossil fuel assets for longer than it previously expected. \u201cWe need continuing near-term investment into today\u2019s energy system \u2013 which depends on oil and gas \u2013 to meet today\u2019s demands and to make sure the transition is an orderly one,\u201d said Bernard Looney, BP\u2019s chief executive. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re responding to what society wants.\u201dLooney has previously called BP a \u201ccash machine\u201d due to its prodigious financial returns, while the company\u2019s finance chief, Murray Auchincloss, last year admitted that \u201cit is possible that we are getting more cash than we know what to do with\u201d.Carbon offsets are flawed but we are now in a climate emergencyRead moreThis stance drew a sharp rebuke from campaigners who point out that the largest fossil fuel companies are still investing relatively little into clean energy, endangering the goals of the Paris climate agreement.\u201cIf the bulk of your investments remain tied to fossil fuels, and you even plan to increase those investments, you cannot maintain to be Paris-aligned, because you will not achieve large-scale emissions reductions by 2030,\u201d said Mark van Baal, founder of Follow This, an activist shareholder group.\u201cThe picture is clear now, no oil major has plans to drive down emissions this decade. Now it\u2019s up to the shareholders. Together with major investors, we continue to compel BP to put its full weight behind the energy transition.\u201d",

        "text": "Shortly before Christmas, the former energy minister Chris Skidmore announced he would not be standing again as a Conservative MP.He was one of a slew of Tory MPs to do so, amid party turmoil and plunging opinion polls. But unlike his colleagues, he was in a unique position to make his views felt. During her brief premiership, Liz Truss had effectively made him the UK net zero tsar, tasked with writing a comprehensive review of the country\u2019s progress towards achieving the legally binding target for greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.Now Skidmore, one of the co-authors with Truss and the former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng of the notorious rightwing Britannia Unchained tract, has delivered a stinging broadside against the government he is leaving.His review argues that the Conservatives have failed on nearly every aspect of net zero policy. Though it is cloaked in polite language, and couched in terms of constructive suggestions rather than hard-hitting new policy demands, there is little in its 320 pages to show the government is on track on any of the wide range of policies needed, on areas from transport to housing, farming to energy generation.\u201cFrom a former Tory minster, this is a very significant clear-eyed analysis of what is missing from government policy,\u201d said Polly Billington, the chief executive of UK100, a group of local government leaders that campaigns for climate action. \u201cThis is a strong critique of the shortcomings on net zero.\u201dAcross the areas of policy that are key to meeting emissions target, Skidmore records failure after failure. Renewable energy growth has been hampered by government U-turns and dithering, he notes. Homes are leaking heat because of the government\u2019s refusal to enact insulation programmes, and new ones are still being built with no regard to net zero standards. Land use is confused and farmers are not being helped to make low-carbon choices. Transport policy emerges from this critique as more or less an abject mess, though Skidmore skimps on the recommendations he could have made to rectify it.Yet his review also makes it clear that net zero offers huge economic potential for the UK. Rather than being a cost, as Skidmore\u2019s rightwing colleagues would argue, the review shows in detail how pursuing net zero can bring: green jobs, economic growth to regions in need of levelling-up, health and wellbeing benefits as well as fulfilling the UK\u2019s international climate obligations.Skidmore has said how deep-delving and broad-ranging this review is. He told the Guardian: \u201cThe independent review \u2018Mission Zero\u2019 is the largest ever engagement with organisations, business and industry on net zero. As the independent chair, I\u2019ve personally listened to over 1,000 individuals and companies in over 50 roundtables held across the country in every region and devolved nation of the UK. The review is as comprehensive as I could make it \u2013 with over 130 recommendations in the 330 page report.\u201dHe added: \u201cAbove all, I hope it demonstrates how to implement and deliver on net zero effectively, efficiently and in the most cost effective way by getting on with the transition. As the report explains, net zero is a huge investment opportunity for the UK and I have sought to set out the positive case for why we should be making it easier to invest in sustainable and renewable energy.\u201dLord Stern, a global development and climate economist, said the findings pointed to new economic potential for the UK. \u201c[This is] a rigorous, robust, and inclusive review of the evidence on the economics of the UK\u2019s net zero transition, [which argues] convincingly that the transition to a net zero economy is the growth opportunity of the 21st century, and the UK is well-placed to benefit from the increasing demand for net zero goods and services, if it makes the right public and private investments.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt highlights the critical importance of government creating an environment that is conducive to this investment by providing clarity, certainty, consistency and continuity of policy. This transition, and the investment and innovation it embodies, are at the core of the UK\u2019s growth story for the coming decade.\u201dCampaigners have said they would have liked to see a much harder-hitting set of recommendations across the board: some were disappointed, and felt that Skidmore had pulled his punches.But it would be wrong to under-estimate his work. This is a damning document, by one of the party\u2019s own loyalists, laying bare how badly off track the UK government is on its core climate policy commitment, and how little appetite the government has for seizing the policy and economic opportunities on offer.",

This species is relatively common in open waters of the twilight zone, between about 500 and 1,000 metres down, so it was a surprise to find this one in the trawl net that Tea and his team were using to sample animal life closer to the seabed.The viperfish\u2019s teeth form a trap for prey and are very difficult to see. Photograph: Museum VictoriaThe viperfish\u2019s splendid teeth not only form a trap for prey, but they\u2019re very difficult to see. \u201cHaving really transparent, big teeth, allows you to conceal something that is otherwise very obvious and very evident,\u201d says Tea.A few years ago, a study of a closely related species of deep-sea fish, the shiny loosejaw (Aristostomias scintillans), uncovered the secret of their see-through teeth. They\u2019re made of enamel and dentine, the same substances as human teeth. The intricate nanostructure of their teeth scatters very little light and instead lets it pass straight through. This means the fish\u2019s teeth don\u2019t twinkle in the bioluminescent lights made by so many animals in the deep sea.Along with other members of their family, the Stomiidae, including dragonfish, stareaters and loosejaws, viperfish have another trick that helps make them even more formidable predators of the deep. Their jaws aren\u2019t fixed firmly in place but are loosely held together with ligaments and cartilage, allowing them to be slung open very widely.They also don\u2019t have stiff vertebrae at the back of their skulls. \u201cImagine having a neck with no bone,\u201d says Tea. \u201cIf you bend your neck really far back, and your jaw extends really far forward, you end up having these enormous gapes that are otherwise quite impossible.\u201dThis family of fish is incredibly well adapted for life in the deep sea. \u201cThey\u2019ve just managed to diversify really well,\u201d says Tea. One member of the family, the stoplight loosejaw, can unusually produce and detect red light. As sunlight seeps into the ocean it gets very quickly absorbed by the water, so most deep-sea species have lost the ability to see red. By shining their own red light through the dark, the stoplight loosejaw has evolved a private wavelength. \u201cIt\u2019s using this invisible torch to look for things that don\u2019t see it coming,\u201d says Tea.Glassy fangs and glowing fins: amazing deep sea animals found near Cocos IslandsRead moreQ&AWhat is the Discovered in the deep series?ShowThe ocean is one of the world\u2019s last truly wild spaces.

Previous studies quantifying the death toll from air pollution assumed all PM2.5 sources posed the same risk, and therefore probably underestimated the dangers of coal plants.\u2018Insanity\u2019: petrostates planning huge expansion of fossil fuels, says UN reportRead moreGovernment regulations save lives, according to the research, which is published in Science, as most deaths happened when environmental standards were weakest and PM2.5 levels from coal-fired power stations highest.\u201cAir pollution from coal is much more harmful than we thought, and we\u2019ve been treating it like it\u2019s just another air pollutant,\u201d said the lead author, Lucas Henneman, an assistant professor in the Sid and Reva Dewberry department of civil, environmental and infrastructure engineering at George Mason University. \u201cThis type of evidence is important to policymakers like EPA [the US Environmental Protection Agency] as they identify cost-effective solutions for cleaning up the country\u2019s air, like requiring emissions controls or encouraging renewables.\u201dHenneman led a group of researchers who used publicly available data to track air pollution \u2013 and its health effects \u2013 from the 480 US coal power plants that operated at some point between 1999 and 2020. A model was used to track the wind direction and reach of the toxins from each power station. Annual exposure levels were then connected with more than 650m Medicare health records that covered most people over age 65 in the US.The coal plants associated with most deaths were located east of the Mississippi River in industrialized states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, where power stations were historically constructed close to population hubs. But every region had at least one plant linked to 600 deaths, while 10 were associated with more than 5,000 deaths across the study period.About 85% of the total 460,000 coal plant-related deaths occurred between 1999 and 2007, an average of more than 43,000 deaths per year. The death toll declined drastically as plants closed or scrubbers \u2013 a type of sulphur filter \u2013 were installed to comply with new environmental rules. By 2020, the coal PM2.5 death toll had dropped 95%, to 1,600 people.\u201cBy linking records of where Medicare beneficiaries lived and when they died, we found that risks due to PM2.5 from coal were more than double the risks related to PM2.5 from all sources,\u201d said co-author Francesca Dominici, a professor of biostatistics, population and data science at the Harvard TC Chan school of public health.Coal use has declined in the US, but there are still more than 200 coal-fired power plants, accounting for 20% of electricity generation in 2022, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). Indiana, Kentucky and Texas have the most operational coal plants, followed by Illinois, Missouri and Pennsylvania.Globally, coal-generated power is still rising, with South Africa, China, India and Poland among the countries most dependent on the dirtiest of fossil fuels.\u201cAs countries debate their energy sources \u2013 and as coal maintains a powerful, almost mythical status in American energy lore \u2013 our findings are highly valuable to policymakers and regulators as they weigh the need for cheap energy with the significant environmental and health costs,\u201d said Dominici.",

He was a member of the Shropshire Wildlife Trust council from 1976, served as trust president from 1988 to 1993 and remained a vice-president until recently.In the 1970s, Paul started the task of rewilding the four-acre field at our family home near Betton Moss \u2013 a pioneering conservation initiative back then and one which he continued working on until his death. This enhanced local biodiversity, resulting in the return of barn owls and increases in other birds, mammals and invertebrates, such as land snails and butterflies, including brimstones. He added ponds and erected nest boxes and refuges of all sizes, for birds and for bats, native bees and small mammals. He also designed and planted a small wood there.Through his presentations to groups, photographs and writings, he aimed to influence others. He championed conservation-focused land use as an alternative to formal country gardens or high-intensity farming. Paul co-authored a chapter on the Shropshire Wildlife Trust in Wildlife in Trust, a book published in 2012 to celebrate 100 years of nature conservation in the UK and he had a monthly column, Country Comment, in the local newspaper for 34 years.Paul and his twin brother, Ben, were born in Penkhull, Staffordshire, the sons of Benjamin Bell, managing director of Brittains paper mill, and his wife, Elsie (nee Moores). Both boys developed an early love of nature, and during childhood they kept many animals; Ben recalls a tame magpie landing in an orange jelly and a neighbour calling the police after a pet squirrel ran up her skirt.Paul went to Newcastle high school and trained as a dentist at the University of Edinburgh before going into practice in 1966, first in Tunstall, Staffordshire, later in Market Drayton. The following year he married Jean Kimmel, and they went on to have two daughters \u2013 me and my sister, Kate.His family will remember Paul for his love of fun and nonsense, and also for his ability to sit in patient silence, watching and listening, attentive to the slightest sound or movement of wildlife around him.He is survived by Jean, his children, two grandsons, Louis and Emil, and his brother, Ben.",

But it was not until six years later that he was able to capture the extraordinary image of a male Japanese giant salamander guarding hundreds of eggs, which gained him a place in the finals of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition, staged by London\u2019s Natural History Museum. The salamander was named Fukuda-kun in his honour.It was the first time the nesting behaviour of these mysterious amphibians, which it is thought could live up to 100 years and whose biology has changed little over the last 23m years, had been caught on camera.But then, for four years, Fukuda-kun was nowhere to be seen. \u201cHe got stuck beneath a dam downstream,\u201d says Fukuda, before the salamander eventually managed to make his way around the barrier.The second largest of the world\u2019s three main giant salamander species (the others are in China and the US), Japanese giant salamanders (Andrias japonicus) can grow up to 1.5 metres in length. The heaviest specimen on record is in Tottori Prefectural Museum and weighs 44.3kg. Despite their size, these creatures face multiple threats, among them the weirs, dams and concrete riverbanks that fragment their habitat in the rivers of central and western Japan \u2013 the only places where this species lives in the wild.No one knows how many Japanese giant salamanders are left. Its red list status has been changed from \u2018near threatened\u2019 to \u2018vulnerable\u2019. Photograph: Yukihiro Fukuda/TopOutImagesThe artificial barriers, built for flood control and to improve irrigation for agriculture, prevent them from migrating upstream to reach breeding sites, as well as destroying the natural dens where the salamanders reproduce and hatch their eggs. In some areas it is likely that local populations are already extinct, says Yuki Taguchi, a researcher and member of the Japanese Giant Salamander Society.In December 2022, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) changed their red list status from \u201cnear threatened\u201d to \u201cvulnerable\u201d. Experts estimate that the population might have declined by 30% to 50% since 1955, but the loss \u201ccould be even greater\u201d.Among those working to secure the salamander\u2019s future is Richard Pearce, an ecotourism consultant from the UK who has lived in Japan for more than a decade. In 2021, he founded the NGO Sustainable Daisen, which is building ramps across weirs to allow salamanders to move freely along the Nawa River system that flows from Mount Daisen, the highest peak in the Ch\u016bgoku region.Weirs and other artificial structures fragment the river habitat of the Japanese giant salamander. Photograph: Yukihiro Fukuda/TopOutImagesRamps and ladders have been built in various locations but they cannot compensate for the sheer number of weirs in Japanese rivers. \u201cMany more ramps are needed,\u201d Taguchi says.Marine life hit by \u2018perfect storm\u2019 as red list reveals species close to extinctionRead moreIn September, with permission from the local government, Sustainable Daisen built temporary ramps out of stones and wood across four weirs in the Nawa River basin, Daisen town. \u201cWe\u2019ve got [them] to admit the weirs are a problem for Japanese giant salamanders and recognise that ramps are a way of remedying it,\u201d Pearce says. The next step is to make the structures permanent and build more.Pearce does not, however, think public funds will be available for building ramps anytime soon. Convincing citizens and officials that money should be spent on conservation measures is difficult. Like many rural towns in Japan, Daisen has a shrinking and ageing population and declining economy, making financial and human resources scarce. Conservation is not a priority.Plus, throughout Japan, \u201cnot enough young people are interested in conservation and if they are, they can\u2019t find jobs in this field\u201d, says Mizuki Takahashi, an associate professor in biology at Bucknell University in the US and a member of the team that evaluated the Japanese giant salamander\u2019s red list status.A clutch of Japanese giant salamander eggs. Photograph: Yukihiro Fukuda/TopOutImagesThe way the Japanese giant salamander is protected is also a problem. A 1952 law established that it cannot be hunted or, for those without a licence, even touched. But the law also designated it as a \u201cspecial natural monument\u201d, which means responsibility for it lies in the hands of cultural agencies, which are rarely staffed with biologists or wildlife experts.Pearce and others believe that time is running out to save the Japanese giant salamander. \u201cTwenty-three million years of DNA might die out on our watch,\u201d Pearce says. \u201cI honestly believe that if I don\u2019t do anything in time, no one else will.\u201dThis story was produced with support from Internews\u2019 Earth Journalism Network",

It adds that a residential or commercial building with this level of risk would be considered uninsurable.The report is being published before health day at the Cop28 UN climate conference, being held in Dubai. Countries will be discussing how to mitigate the health impacts of climate breakdown, which include the spread of disease and the effects of extreme weather events.\u201cClimate change is increasingly impacting the health of people around the world,\u201d said Dr Karl Mallon, director of science and technology at XDI. \u201cWhat happens when severe weather results in hospital shutdowns as well? Our analysis shows that without a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the risks to global health will be exacerbated further, as thousands of hospitals become unable to deliver services during crises.\u201dAlthough some of the hospitals can be adapted to face the effects of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, severe storms, flooding and forest fires, many will have to be moved at great expense.What is Cop28 and why does it matter?Read moreAs with many of the impacts of climate breakdown, this will mostly affect lower- and middle-income countries, where 71% (11,512) of the hospitals at risk by the end of the century are located. Currently, south-east Asia has the highest percentage of hospitals at high risk of damage from extreme weather events. It faces risks in the future too \u2013 with high emissions, almost one in five hospitals (18.4%) in the region could totally or partially shut down by the end of the century.Prof Nick Watts, director of the Centre for Sustainable Medicine at the National University of Singapore, said: \u201cIt is clear that climate change threatens to undermine the stability of the health systems our patients and communities depend on. Whether it results in the closing of health facilities, or a clinic becoming overwhelmed with rising burdens of disease, the human consequences are dire.\u201dXDI has released the locations and names of all hospitals at risk and is urging governments to check hospitals in their region to protect them.\u201cGovernments have a duty to populations to ensure the ongoing delivery of critical services. For individual governments not to take action on this information, or for the global community not to support governments in need, is blatant disregard for the wellbeing of their citizens,\u201d said Mallon.",

According to Schladow, the zooplankton, especially the Daphnia and Bosmina species, \u201clargely disappeared from the lake after they were grazed down following the introduction of the Mysis shrimp in the 1960s\u201d.Other factors can affect changes in lake clarity including winter runoff, the warming of the lake\u2019s surface and the concentration of particles such as silt, algae or clay. But TERC\u2019s research says the primary factor in the lake\u2019s recent clarity sits squarely with the Daphnia and Bosmina zooplankton.\u201cThese events support the hypothesis we put forward several years ago that the food web is a major factor in controlling lake clarity,\u201d said Brant Allen, a TERC boat captain.However, the assistance provided by nature\u2019s cleanup crew may be only short-term. Mysis shrimp populations are expected to rebound and as they consume zooplankton, the clarity will return to what we have seen in the past 20 years.00:01:19Divers remove 200lb of trash from Lake Tahoe in one day \u2013 videoBecause of this, Schladow said, future management options should look at controlling the shrimp population. \u201cWe have a brief window of time to monitor the lake in the absence of Mysis and then track the impacts of their return.\u201dJulie Regan, executive director of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, said the emerging trend is welcome news for Lake Tahoe at a time when the ecosystem is experiencing more extreme storms, wildfire and warmer temperatures.",

The message from leading climate scientists is clear: action is needed now. Not tomorrow, not next year, not by the end of the decade.Even drastic carbon reduction today that limits temperature increases to the 1.5C agreed in Paris will alter the world we live in for ever. The IPCC concludes that every fraction of a degree more will edge us towards tipping points that will leave deep scars on our planet.While much has been said about the damage to weather patterns, crop yields and coral reefs, less well understood is the effect a hotter world has on our health. The reality is that the climate crisis is the biggest health crisis of our time, bigger even than Covid-19.There has been a rise in chronic diseases linked to air pollutionHeat-related deaths are expected to treble by 2050. Currently 7 million people die prematurely each year from air pollution, more than the death toll during the entire pandemic.There has been a rise in chronic diseases linked to air pollution, and evidence suggests it is driving up cancer rates, too. Lung cancer and respiratory-related deaths linked to air pollution are up 160% over the past 30 years and it causes genetic mutations in some lung cancer-linked genes.The toll on loved ones, public health and the economy is large and rising. It has been estimated that poor health costs the global economy 15% of global GDP. It is not only oil companies, carmakers and airlines at fault. Healthcare alone contributes 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, up to 8% in advanced economies.Investing in greenhouse gas reduction is now proven beyond doubt, equalled or outweighed by the economic benefits of a healthier population, the IPCC says.Increasingly investors are focused on those companies that are taking bold and science-driven action to mitigate climate warming. While this is the right thing to do, it also makes good business sense.Decarbonising the economy is an opportunity and a driver of growth, which is why the backlash against environmental, social and governance focused investing is so misguided. As we saw during the pandemic, science finds a way, ingenuity triumphs and is duly rewarded.At my company, AstraZeneca, we are on track to meet our targets to: reduce scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 those from burning fuels and energy use \u2013 by 98% by 2026; halve our absolute total emissions across our value chain by 2030; and be net zero by 2045. In addition, we have planted millions of trees as part of a large reforestation and biodiversity restoration programme.Like it or not, regulatory requirements are moving towards stopping companies selling products that are not sustainable.

Together we must make public health more resilient, so that it can cope with change and become truly accessible. A forum such as the Sustainable Markets Initiative established by King Charles when he was Prince of Wales, convening stakeholders from across industries, is a good example of collaboration to take shared action at scale.The toll on human health is huge and likely to get worse. Healthcare companies will do all they can to treat patients suffering from climate-related disease. Prevention, however, will have the biggest impact on health.

A third by Etihad offered potential customers \u201ctotal peace of mind\u201d, mentioning their environmental advocacy. All three were banned from appearing again for breaking rules on misleading advertising and environmental claims.In each case, the ASA said the ads could not corroborate their environmental claims, because the UK ad code required such absolute claims to be \u201csupported by a high level of substantiation\u201d.The ruling, published on Wednesday, upheld the complaints against the airlines on the grounds they gave a misleading impression of the impact of air travel on the environment.\u201cWe understood that air travel produced high levels of both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions, which were making a substantial contribution to climate change. We also understood that there were currently no initiatives or commercially viable technologies in operation within the aviation industry that would adequately substantiate absolute green claims,\u201d read the ruling against Etihad.It is the second time this year that Lufthansa and Etihad have fallen foul of UK marketing rules.Lufthansa, which promised it would stop using the slogan \u201cfly more sustainably\u201d, said a paid-for Google ad did not provide space for a full explanation of \u201cgreen fares\u201d but that consumers could follow a link for more information supporting its ad claims.Etihad said after receiving notification of the complaint, it had removed all references to \u201cenvironmental advocacy\u201d from its Google adverts in the UK. Air France-KLM did not respond to the ruling.Aviation accounts for about 2.5% of global CO2 emissions and continues to rise, driving global heating. Despite industry efforts to use carbon offsetting, cleaner fuels and more efficient planes to mitigate the impact of flying, it continues to be a significant source of greenhouse gases.Leo Murray, the director of innovation at the climate charity Possible and co-author of Badvertising: Polluting Our Minds and Fuelling Climate Chaos, said: \u201cIt is fantastic to see the UK\u2019s de facto advertising regulator becoming more confident and proactive in dealing with dishonest corporate sustainability claims like this one, and we applaud their growing use of AI to cast the net much wider than has been possible in the past.\u201dHowever, he added: \u201cAs the ASA explicitly notes, there is no such thing as environmentally friendly air travel, and our own work shows that meeting our climate commitments means overall levels of demand for flying must fall, and fast.\u201dAir France, Lufthansa and Etihad were contacted by the Guardian. Lufthansa said it regretted \u201cthe Google advertisement in question lacked the explanation of the further basis for the statement \u2018fly more sustainable\u2019\u201d and that it regularly informed its customers, stakeholders and the public about its responsibility to reduce the environmental impact of flying.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Business TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What was my favourite animal, she inquired reasonably. \u201cI hate all animals,\u201d I replied, \u201capart from maybe squirrels or frogs.\u201d Twenty-two years later, I would like to plead diminished responsibility. This wasn\u2019t really my view, but that of my mum, who really did hate animals.So, naturally, we weren\u2019t allowed pets. For a long time, the closest I got was fostering the primary school stick insects during holidays. (I can still tell you the delicate difference between a stick insect poo and an egg. The egg has a dot on it. The other is just a poo.) Then, in year five, I came across Sea-Monkeys. It was the late 90s, and they were marketed as educational toys and sold in bookshops. With all due respect to the late Sea-Monkeys inventor Harold von Braunhut, they are one of history\u2019s greatest cons.Sea-Monkeys start life as brine shrimp eggs contained in a sachet: tip them in water and they start to hatch. In the 60s and 70s, they were advertised in comics using illustrations of human-like figures. Apparently, many buyers were disappointed by the dissimilarity, such was the strength of Von Braunhut\u2019s con. Sea-Monkeys actually look like swimming head lice, though, at first, they look like nothing at all \u2013 which won me the prize for smallest pet at pet day.I became aggressively proud of my Sea-Monkeys. Not only were they prize-winners, but nobody else had them (and, surely, nobody else wanted them). I obsessively browsed the accompanying leaflet that advertised such marvels as \u201cThe Great Sea-Monkey Baseball Game\u201d and a racetrack. While I wasn\u2019t sure that my vacant little swimmers even knew up from down, Von Braunhut had prepared me for magic to happen before my very eyes, and I begged to buy it. Unsurprisingly, this was a non-starter.So my artemia crew swam around idly behind the kitchen sink until mum accidentally knocked them out of the window. Stricken, she guiltily bought me a new set. All was well \u2026 until they started having orgies. Sea-Monkeys mate by biting on to each other\u2019s tails. (Do not ask me the finer mechanics.) Mine were starting to swim around in trails of half a dozen and more. Repulsed, I \u201clet them go\u201d, thus concluding my pet-owning career.In an unexpected about-face, my parents got a dog called Bruce two years ago \u2013 and they are both absolutely silly for him. Whenever I am home, I swim in the sea and have accepted that one day I will be dragged into the deep by one of my abandoned Sea-Monkeys, now a giant, sewage-addled mutant. If I\u2019m lucky, perhaps Bruce will swim in and save me.",

In rural areas there are real problems of isolation and loneliness. There are all sorts of benefits \u2013 therapeutic, meeting up with others, finding a sense of belonging and purpose. [This idea] is not complicated but it can make a huge difference.\u201dNewcome was speaking on Wednesday at a conference at Lambeth Palace, the London headquarters of the archbishop of Canterbury, to promote gardening and mental health. The garden at Lambeth Palace, stretching over 10 acres, is one of the oldest in England.A survey of clergy last year showed that mental health issues were one of the main problems they encountered in their parishes, along with loneliness and homelessness.David Shreeve, who advises the church on environmental issues, said: \u201cThere are 16,400 C of E churches, many with unused spaces around them, and often in difficult urban areas with homes without gardens and few parks. There are people who have never done any gardening before but when they plant a seed or bulb, nurture it, see it sprout and grow, it has an enormously positive effect.\u201dAmong the speakers at the conference was Jonathan Aitken, the former Conservative cabinet minister who went to prison for perjury. He was ordained as an Anglican deacon last year and is now training to be a prison chaplain.\u201cThere are astonishing mental health problems in our prisons, including self-harming and suicides. Could gardening make a difference? I think it might,\u201d said Aitken, who said he worked in the gardens of HMP Standford Hill during his prison term.Aitken said he was involved in discussions about a possible gardening projectinvolving the Young Offender Institution Feltham and a nearby church with a \u201cbig wilderness of a garden\u201d.\u201cGardening slows you down and calms you down. You have all these troubled, testosterone-fuelled, aggressive young men. It might help to get them out of the concrete spaces of prison into the fresh air,\u201d he said.Rachel Kelly, a mental health campaigner and author, said people with depression found it hard to cope with big demands but gardening was \u201cvery scaleable\u201d. She added: \u201cEven on a really bad day you might be able to snip a rose or sweep a path, and that gives you a sense of achievement.\u201d",

Further fundraising will take place, with members of the new London rewilding roundtable group tasked with sourcing private donations.Goldsmith said: \u201cI\u2019m so excited to be working with Sadiq on this new rewilding taskforce for London. All people need to experience close connection with nature in their lives, and yet for many Londoners this is a remote possibility today.\u201cFrom green rooftops to pocket parks, nest boxes for peregrines and swifts, rewiggling streams and reintroducing long lost native species, our plan is to weave wild nature back through the very fabric of our city.\u201dThere are 1,600 places designated by local authorities as sites of importance for nature conservation, covering 20% of the capital. These include Richmond Park, Sydenham Hill Wood and the downlands in Bromley and Croydon that inspired Charles Darwin\u2019s discoveries. At the moment, just half of these are deemed appropriately managed to conserve or enhance the wildlife.The project will focus on 20-30 of these sites to protect species including stag beetles, sparrows, peregrine falcons and water voles. Khan has stated an aim for all Londoners to live within a 10-minute walk of green space, with this scheme aiming to connect existing spaces so everyone in the capital can enjoy nature.A red deer stag at sunrise on a winter\u2019s morning in Richmond Park, south-west London. Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesIt is also hoped the work will help tackle problems that plague Londoners including flooding and air pollution. Improving floodplains, rewiggling streams and boosting the health of rivers can alleviate floods, and planting more greenery can ease air pollution.Khan said: \u201cThe UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. In London, we need to take bold action to ensure we not only halt the decline of biodiversity in our natural environment but pave the way for growth and change.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve announced my new rewilding fund, which will help restore the capital\u2019s precious wildlife sites, improve biodiversity and ensure all Londoners have a thriving web of nature on their doorstep. And as part of our green new deal, we\u2019re supporting young Londoners to gain the skills required for jobs that help secure a future for London\u2019s natural environment.\u201dNature campaigners have been trying to add wildlife back to London, with a beaver group comprising Wildlife Trusts, the Beaver Trust and Citizen Zoo working on how to return the species to the capital.The community wilding group Citizen Zoo is also involved with projects to return grasshoppers and water voles to areas in the city in which they have been depleted or lost.",

        "text": "A new class-action lawsuit alleges US beverage maker Bolthouse Farms deceived customers with claims that its Green Goodness smoothie is made of \u201c100% fruit juice\u201d after testing found the drink contains toxic PFAS, a synthetic chemical, at levels far above federal advisory drinking water limits.PFAS are a class of about 12,000 chemicals typically used to make thousands of consumer products resist water, stains and heat. They are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not naturally break down, and they are linked to cancer, fetal complications, liver disease, kidney disease, autoimmune disorders and other serious health issues.Though water is considered to be a main exposure route to the chemicals, researchers are increasingly finding food to be a source of exposure. However, the Food and Drug Administration has taken few meaningful steps to protect the nation\u2019s food supply, critics say.\u201cWhen FDA falters, the law firms that are out there are going to protect their clients because the FDA is not dealing with it,\u201d said Tom Neltner, chemicals policy director with the Environmental Defense Fund, a non-profit that pressures the agency to take stronger action on PFAS.Attorneys for the plaintiffs and Bolthouse Farms did not respond to requests for comment. The same attorneys weeks earlier filed a similar suit against Coca-Cola over PFAS in its Simply Tropical drink.Though Bolthouse\u2019s packaging states that the smoothie is made of \u201c100% fruit juice\u201d, the suit says PFAS are \u201ca category of synthetic chemicals that are, by definition, artificial\u201d.Its testing found three PFAS compounds \u2013 PFOS, 6:2 FTOH, and PFHxS.The Environmental Protection Agency recently found virtually no level of exposure to PFOS in drinking water is safe. No limits exist for 6:2 FTOH and PFHxS because they have not been as thoroughly studied as PFOS, though independent science has linked all three compounds to many of the same health issues.It is unclear how the chemicals got in the drink, and it is highly unlikely they were intentionally added. PFAS researchers who reviewed the case told the Guardian the chemicals may have been in the fruit. Fruit could be contaminated from pesticides, water, or the use of PFAS-tainted sewage sludge as fertilizer.It is also possible any water added to the drink could have been contaminated. Finally, it is conceivable the chemicals were added to the plastic packaging. A lawsuit filed in late December just days ahead of the class-action suit asks a judge to order Houston-based firm Inhance to stop adding PFAS to plastic. Testing from academic and EPA researchers over the last two years has found high levels of the chemicals can leach into food and other products that have been treated with PFAS.However, experts say contaminated plastic is less likely in the Bolthouse case because the levels would probably be much higher.\u201cWe just don\u2019t know, but Bolthouse should, and it should always be testing their products,\u201d Neltner said. \u201cBut I\u2019m guessing they are doing that now.\u201dHe added that it\u2019s a \u201chard class-action case to win because it\u2019s a comparatively small harm to break down,\u201d but he said it is still a harm against potentially millions of customers. Moreover, class-action suits have previously effected regulatory changes and shed light on the scope of the problem.\u201cIt can spur legislative changes, and most of our early public knowledge of PFAS came from discovery in class-action lawsuits,\u201d Neltner added.The suit also highlights Bolthouse\u2019s wider advertising campaign, charging that it is \u201cengaged in pervasive marketing efforts to convince consumers that the product is a healthy, natural fruit juice beverage\u201d. Bolthouse also claims the smoothie is free of \u201cnumerous questionable ingredients\u201d, such artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, the suit states.\u201cDefendant is well aware of consumers\u2019 desire to avoid potentially harmful chemicals, which is exactly why it has engaged in an aggressive, uniform marketing campaign intended to convince consumers that the product is free from artificial ingredients like PFAS,\u201d the suit reads.The suit, filed in the southern district of New York, asks a judge to order monetary compensation and take other \u201cappropriate\u201d steps.",

        "text": "Just 24 hours before the UK gave the go-ahead to develop the UK\u2019s biggest untapped oilfield off Shetland, the world\u2019s leading energy analysts reiterated that no no new oil and gas exploration should take place if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.That stark warning seems to have been ignored by ministers who, after a week in which they have rowed back on the UK\u2019s net zero commitments and scrapped their own home energy efficiency taskforce, are accused of leaving the UK\u2019s climate plans in tatters.The range of opposition to the proposed Rosebank field has been building for the past 18 months.Alongside the International Energy Association, the government\u2019s own climate advisers at the Climate Change Committee said pushing ahead with the new fossil fuel development in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence was \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d. And the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, added his voice calling on governments to halt new licences for oil and gas exploration and development.On the ground, climate scientists and academics have joined MPs and religious leaders as well as 200 charities and civil society groups to raise their opposition.But the UK government seems intent on pushing ahead, with ministers repeatedly saying the new oilfield is needed for energy security adding that it will help people struggling with the cost of living crisis.However, experts point out that last year 75% of the UK\u2019s oil production was exported. They say the same is likely to happen with fossil fuels from any new development.No oil is expected to be produced from Rosebank until 2027 and, wherever the oil ends up, experts say it will be sold on the international market at the going rate, meaning it will have no little or no impact on the cost of living crisis or energy security.Tessa Khan, executive director of campaign group Uplift and a climate lawyer, said: \u201cRosebank is a rip-off. It\u2019s another case of the government allowing foreign companies to profit, while the costs are put on British people who worry about the world we are handing on to our children.\u201dCampaigners say that if the government were serious about improving energy security and tackling the cost of living crisis they would press ahead with domestic renewable energy and home insulation.The Rosebank project is three times bigger than the controversial Cambo field that was put on hold in 2021 and has the potential to produce 500m barrels of oil, which when burned would emit as much carbon dioxide as running 56 coal-fired power stations for a year.Analysis from GlobalData reveals lifetime emissions from the site would take a huge chunk out of the UK\u2019s climate plans with oil produced over its lifetime equivalent to more than half of the UK\u2019s remaining carbon budget for total fuel supply.Khan said: \u201cAs we\u2019ve heard repeatedly, our world can no longer sustain new oil and gas drilling. And when we\u2019re witnessing scorching temperatures, wildfires, devastating flooding and heatwaves in our seas, it could not be clearer that this is a decision by the prime minister to add more fuel to the fire.\u201dThe Labour party had said it would ban any new oil and gas extraction in the North Sea. However, to the dismay of campaigners, it says it would not revoke any North Sea oil and gas licences granted by this government.Hannah Martin, co executive director of Green New Deal Rising, said if Labour took a strong stand now it could still put a stop to the Rosebank development: \u201cThis position does not make sense, and there is still time for Keir Starmer to put himself on the right side of history and show leadership by committing to revoking Rosebank\u2019s licence.\u201dDespite today\u2019s announcement opponents of the Rosebank scheme are not giving up.\u201cThere are strong grounds to believe that the way this government has come to this decision is unlawful and we will see them in court if so,\u201d said Khan. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to fight this government for cheap, clean energy and a livable climate, but we will.\u201d",

That tragedy is unfolding on the high seas \u2013 the two-thirds of the ocean that lies beyond coastal states\u2019 national jurisdiction. This is a commons, where fishing and mining have been opened to all. The result is serious damage to a vital resource that covers almost half the planet\u2019s surface. The high seas are not entirely lawless. Yet only a tiny fraction of these waters are protected from exploitation, despite harbouring the world\u2019s marine wilderness and its unique biodiversity.Beneath the waves lies a rich prize. Many scientists think the high seas harbour novel disease-fighting chemistry that might lead to new drugs. Until this month, there was no mechanism to prevent nations or companies monopolising the world\u2019s marine genetic resources. One study in 2018 pointed out that BASF, which calls itself \u201cthe largest chemical producer in the world\u201d, owned nearly half of the 13,000 patents derived from marine organisms. Mining exploration licences in the Pacific alone span an area almost as wide as the US. If deep sea extraction were permitted to go ahead, many warn, it would lead to biodiversity loss on an enormous scale.The good news is that the agreement of a historic UN ocean treaty this month may help to slow the plunder. Crucially the deal keeps alive the 30x30 target \u2013 a pledge made by countries at the UN biodiversity conference in December that aims to protect 30% of sea (and land) by 2030. The treaty tries to accommodate both the global north\u2019s desire for a legal framework for establishing marine protected areas (MPAs) to protect against the loss of wildlife and the global south\u2019s expectation that resources are seen as being common to all.All this arrives not a moment too soon. The oceans are not an inexhaustible resource. Yet humanity treats them as if they are boundless. There are limits to how many animals and plants can be sustainably harvested for food and other products. Nor can humanity carry on dumping sewage and pollutants into the watery depths with little care for what damage is being done. In absorbing the carbon dioxide generated by burning fossil fuels, the oceans become much more acidic, threatening marine life. The International Union for Conservation of Nature says that nearly 9% of saltwater species are at risk of extinction.What is encouraging is that the delegates from 193 member states put aside their geopolitical differences to work together in the name of protecting the seas. The new treaty is crucial, as the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said, for addressing the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.There is still some way to go. The new law must be ratified by 60 member states before it can be enforced. The final text contains a tension between the two principles of the \u201cFreedom of the High Seas\u201d and the \u201cCommon Heritage of Humankind\u201d. One key test will be if traditional powers allow controlled access to marine genetic resources and for profits derived from the high seas to be equally shared among all states. The onus is on developed nations to act responsibly because, as Mr Hardin pointed out, too much \u201cfreedom in a commons brings ruin to all\u201d.",

This means that using them in industrial practice is prohibitively expensive because of the heating required. It also means using them is not carbon neutral.Scientists from the Swiss Federal Institute WSL have found microbes that can do this at 15C, which could lead to a breakthrough in microbial recycling. Their findings have been published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology.Dr Joel R\u00fcthi from WSL and colleagues sampled 19 strains of bacteria and 15 of fungi growing on free-lying or intentionally buried plastic kept in the ground for one year in Greenland, Svalbard and Switzerland. They let the microbes grow as single-strain cultures in the laboratory in darkness at 15C and tested them to see if they could digest different types of plastic.The results showed that the bacterial strains belonged to 13 genera in the phyla actinobacteria and proteobacteria, and the fungi to 10 genera in the phyla ascomycota and mucoromycota.The plastics tested included non-biodegradable polyethylene (PE) and the biodegradable polyester-polyurethane (PUR) as well as two commercially available biodegradable mixtures of polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) and polylactic acid (PLA).None of the strains were able to digest PE, even after 126 days of incubation on these plastics. But 19 strains (56%), including 11 fungi and eight bacteria, were able to digest PUR at 15C, while 14 fungi and three bacteria were able to digest the plastic mixtures of PBAT and PLA.R\u00fcthi said: \u201cHere we show that novel microbial taxa obtained from the \u2018plastisphere\u2019 of alpine and arctic soils were able to break down biodegradable plastics at 15C. These organisms could help to reduce the costs and environmental burden of an enzymatic recycling process for plastic.\u201dHe said it was surprising that a large fraction of the tested strains were able to degrade at least one of the tested plastics.The scientists also tested for the best performers and found that they were two uncharacterised fungal species in the genera neodevriesia and lachnellula, which could digest all of the tested plastics except PE.While plastics have only been in wide use since the 1950s, microbes can degrade polymers because they resemble some structures found in plant cells.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Down to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Nevertheless, they say it works well between 4C and 20C.Frey said: \u201cThe next big challenge will be to identify the plastic-degrading enzymes produced by the microbial strains and to optimise the process to obtain large amounts of proteins.

We are aware of previous statements that Baillie Gifford has made on its investments and our work relies on their support.\u201dA representative from Baillie Gifford reiterated its previous words: \u201cWe are not a significant fossil fuel investor.\u201dOf course Greta Thunberg is right to call out greenwashing, but the reality can be messy | Charlotte HigginsRead more\u201cOnly 2% of our clients\u2019 money is invested in companies with some business related to fossil fuels. This compares to the market average of 11%,\u201d the firm added. \u201cOf those companies, some have already moved most of their business away from fossil fuels, and many are helping to drive the transition to clean energy.\u201dEllen Miles, author of Get Guerrilla Gardening and campaign organiser at FFB, said the group is specifically targeting Baillie Gifford because of the firm\u2019s \u201cunique relationship\u201d with the UK literary industry, \u201cdue to its role as key sponsors of 11 literary festivals\u201d as well as its nonfiction prize.\u201cIt\u2019s true Baillie Gifford aren\u2019t the worst asset manager out there,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is another reason we\u2019re hopeful they will listen. Given that investments in fossil fuel companies constitute just 2.3% of their overall portfolio, it should be achievable for Baillie Gifford to divest from these initiatives, while continuing to support the UK literary scene.\u201dMiles stressed that FFB is \u201cstriving to work with these festivals, not against them\u201d, and \u201cwe\u2019re not pushing for authors to drop out of festivals\u201d.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to BookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s.
